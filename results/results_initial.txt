Headline : Graham, Cruz tell Mayorkas he's on notice for possible impeachment over border crisis
Corpus :  EXCLUSIVE:GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, joined forces to send a message to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas that they have "grounds for impeachment" if he fails to act swiftly in correcting his "gross dereliction of duty" at the southern border. In a letter to Mayorkas on Tuesday evening exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital, the senators compiled data produced by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) that show that the crisis at the southern border has deteriorated since Mayorkas took office 19 months ago. "This is gross dereliction of duty and, if not corrected swiftly, could provide grounds for impeachment," the senators wrote. "Yourfailure to faithfully enforcethis nation’s immigration laws and willful blindness to the very real humanitarian crisis at our southern border amounts to a gross dereliction of duty and a violation of your oath of office," the senators wrote. "Despite the heroic efforts by the men and women of Border Patrol, who operate with very little support from Washington, D.C., you have failed to achieve any semblance of operational control of the southern border," they continued. According to CBP, there have been "over 4.4 million illegal crossings, including over 3.5 million apprehensions by CBP and at least 900,000 gotaways, who evaded apprehension." In addition to the record-high border crossings and migrant encounters, the senators charge Mayorkas with enabling a drug production and smuggling enterprise by Mexican cartels with China-supplied drug ingredients that directly contributed to the "fentanyl-fueled" opioid pandemic that killed108,000 Americans last year. Fentanyl, which has become the leading cause of death of Americans ages 18 to 45, is "streaming across our southern border," the senators wrote, noting that just last month2,287 pounds of fentanylwere seized by CBP agents — enough to kill more than 500 million people. "Drug cartels produce bulk amounts of fentanyl in Mexico, using the Chinese-supplied ingredients, and smuggle the drug across the U.S.-Mexico border," the senators explained in their letter. "This amounts to a multi-billion dollar business for transnational criminal organizations, who then launder the money out of the United States and back into China." "This lucrative illicit enterprise continues to thrive—while Americans die—all because DHS has ceded control of our southern border to the cartels for political gain," they continued. DHS IG REPORT OUTLINES HOW BORDER PATROL FACILITIES IN DEL RIO SECTOR WERE OVERWHELMED BY MIGRANT SURGE The senators also warned that the "chaos" at the southern border "presents a prime opportunity for terrorists to enter the United States undetected," especially following the "disastrous withdrawal" of U.S. troops from Afghanistan last year, noting that border patrol agents have apprehended at "least 78 individuals on the Terrorist Screening Database" so far in fiscal year 2022 — more than twice as many apprehended in the past five fiscal years combined. "It is a near certainty that terrorists have already entered the United States undetected, taking advantage of the lenient border policies you have put into place," the senators wrote. "It is only a matter of time until we will see an attack on American soil from such terrorists." ARIZONA DISTRIBUTES FENTANYL TESTING STRIPS AS DEADLY PILLS DISGUISED AS OTHER DRUGS FLOW ACROSS BORDER Both Graham and Cruz, who serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee, prior to this letter have implored Mayorkas and the White House numerous times to make changes and address the border crisis. Collectively, the Republican senators have visited the border six times in the last two years. Neither President Joe Biden nor "border czar" Vice President Kamala Harris have visited the border since taking office, the senators noted in their letter. "You have stated multiple times that "the border is secure" even as the crisis rages on," the senators wrote. "Vice President Harris apparently shares this same delusion. Perhaps if she or President Biden would visit the southern border and actually see the unending surge of illegal immigration, illicit drugs and human suffering, the White House would feel differently," they state. BETO O'ROURKE SAYS BIDEN ADMIN 'CERTAINLY' NEEDS 'TO DO MORE' TO FIND SOLUTIONS ON BORDER CRISIS The White House has repeatedly denied claims of a crisis at the southern border. Most recently, Harris twice declared that the U.S. southern border is "secure" during an interview last month, despite a record number of migrants crossing into the country. "We fully expect that in a few months’ time a Republican-led Congress will hold you to account for your willful negligence regarding the security of the southern border and the safety of the American people," the senators conclude. DHS did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment on the letter.

Headline : Diversity, equity, inclusion dominate Biden admin's policy priorities across agencies
Corpus :  The Treasury Department's launch of a new advisory committee on racial equity is just one of dozens of ways in which the federal government is working to advance President Biden's sweeping diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility (DEIA) agenda. "We know that we need to do all we can to build a fairer economy, and that’s why we have put racial equity at the forefront of our agenda at Treasury and across the Biden administration,"Treasury Secretary Janet Yellensaid Tuesday as she announced the equity committee. The Treasury committee is a natural extension of theadministration’s broad effort to promote "equity"that started with an executive order on advancing racial equity that Biden issued on his first day in office. Yellen said the administration has pursued that goal in bills like the American Rescue Plan, which aspires to build a foundation for an "equitable economic recovery," and the infrastructure bill, which she said will boost investment in communities "that have often been ignored or overlooked." Treasury is one of several federal agencies taking its cue from the White House. In the run-up to the midterm elections, the White House has put up a series of posts about equity as it relates to federal grant funding, federally funded research, stopping the spread of monkeypox and access to infrastructure contracts. BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WANTS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO BE DIVERSITY, EQUITY MODEL FOR THE NATION DEIA has also attached itself to other Biden administration priorities, such as climate change. Just last week,Vice President Harris caused a stirwhen she said assistance to climate-ravaged areas of the country must be distributed with "equity" in mind, which many Republicans interpreted as a sign that relief for Hurricane Ian in Florida might be doled out according to race. The White House later clarified that Harris was not talking about relief specific to Hurricane Ian when she said low-income communities and communities of color are most vulnerable to climate change, and that the government needs to "address this in a way that is about giving resources based on equity." VICE CHAIR OF TREASURY DEPT'S NEW RACIAL EQUITY COMMITTEE WANTS TO DEFUND THE POLICE, ‘CENTER RACE’ IN ALL POLICY Between Biden's executive order and the drumbeat of attention to diversity and equity created by the White House, other major federal departments have taken their own steps to advance DEIA: The U.S. Department of Agriculture launched an Equity Commission at the start of 2022 to advise the secretary on how programs and practices within the department "contribute to barriers to inclusion or access, systemic discrimination, or exacerbate or perpetuate racial, economic, health and social disparities." USDA says the commission will confront the "hard reality of past discrimination and its lingering harm." The group last met in late September, and it hopes to submit a final report on its findings next year. The Commerce Department released a 20-page "Equity Action Plan" in April that says officials will work to build "innovation ecosystems in historically underserved communities," expand assistance to minority businesses and make DOC resources more available to underserved communities. In late September, the Pentagon announced a new defense advisory committee on diversity and inclusion, which will provide advice and recommendations on "matters and policies relating to the improvement of racial/ethnic diversity, inclusion and equal opportunity within the department." A week later, DOD released a 37-page plan to promote DEIA. This week, the Department of Energy announced $116 million in grants for programs focused on "equity and accessibility" for students and announced it will soon appoint members to an advisory commission to promote equity and opportunity for Hispanics. Last week, it announced a plan to address "digital equity," and on Sept. 1, it released a plan to advance DEIA within the department. This week, the Department of Health and Human Services announced nearly $5 million in grants to 10 organizations under a program aimed at addressing factors that contribute to "structural racism in public health." The funding will help identify policies that "may create or perpetuate health disparities and may contribute to structural racism." HHS also awarded $2 million in grant funding to groups focused on "health equity." ‘WOKE’ DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE EQUITY CHIEF WRITES ANTI-WHITE POSTS: ‘EXHAUSED WITH THESE WHITE FOLX’ In mid-September, the Department of Homeland Security awarded $20 million in funding to 43 groups through the Targeted Violence and Terrorism Protection grant program. DHS said 11 of those grants went to groups that work with underserved populations that can be targeted for attack, including two Historically Black Colleges and two groups that serve LGBTQ+ people. DHS added a new priority to the awards this year, which is to advance equity in awards and engage with underserved communities. In May, the Justice Department released a "comprehensive environmental justice enforcement strategy" aimed at advancing "environmental justice in underserved communities that have been historically marginalized and overburdened, including low-income communities, communities of color, and Tribal and Indigenous communities." CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP This week, the Department of Labor announced $80 million in grant funding to help fill the nation’s nursing shortage in a way that advances equity and brings "greater employment equity in underserved communities and improve health care workforce diversity." The Transportation Department this week marked the start of National Pedestrian Safety Month and reminded readers about the "disparities in pedestrian safety and the importance of equity in road safety for all. Black and Native American pedestrians are disproportionately killed in the United States, as compared to white pedestrians."

Headline : Biden scolds 'MAGA Republicans' after 5th Circuit Court strikes down DACA, orders no new applicants
Corpus :  President Biden lashed out at a federal appeals court on Wednesday, after it ruled theDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) programwas illegally implemented by the Obama administration. In a statement, the president called the decision "unlawful" andurged Congressto make permanent legislative protections to help more than 600,000 immigrants currently protected by DACA. On Wednesday, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court’s three-judge panel determined the Obama administration lacked the authority to institute the DACA program. However, the court stopped short of judicially dismantling it and said DACA migrants could continue to receive legal protections. "I am disappointed in today's Fifth Circuit decision holding that DACA is unlawful. The court’s stay provides a temporary reprieve for DACA recipients, but one thing remains clear: the lives of Dreamers remain in limbo," Biden said. FEDERAL APPEALS COURT RULES OBAMA-ERA DACA PROGRAM ILLEGAL, BUTS SAYS 600,000 ALREADY IN US CAN STAY "Today’s decision is the result of continued efforts byRepublican state officialsto strip DACA recipients of the protections and work authorization that many have now held for over a decade," the president added. "And while we will use the tools we have to allow Dreamers to live and work in the only country they know as home," Biden continued, "it is long past time for Congress to pass permanent protections for Dreamers, including a pathway to citizenship." BIDEN ADMIN MOVES TO STRENGTHEN OBAMA-ERA DACA PROGRAM AMID LEGAL CHALLENGES The circuit court also ruled the U.S. government could not process new applicants for DACA and ordered aTexas federal judgereview the program. "A district court is in the best position to review the administrative record in the rulemaking proceeding and determine whether our holdings as to the 2012 DACA Memorandum fully resolve issues concerning the Final Rule," the court wrote. Biden specifically blamed "MAGA-Republican officials" for the court’s decision as several Republican-led states sued the federal government over the DACA program. Governors allege the program negatively impacts their local economies as they have to foot the bill for DACA recipients’ education and healthcare. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP "My Administration is committed to defending Dreamers against attacks from Republican officials in Texas and other states,"Biden concluded."This challenge to DACA is just another example of the extreme agenda being pushed by MAGA-Republican officials." The rule takes effect on October 31. Fox News’ Adam Sabes, David Spunt and Allie Simon, and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Headline : Records show one third of Fetterman's days as Lt. Gov. had empty schedule for more than 3 years: AP
Corpus :  Democratic Pennsylvania Senate candidate John Fetterman has pointed to his work as the state's current lieutenant governor as he campaigns for a job in Washington, D.C., but an Associated Press review of his time in that position shows a noticeably light workload. The examination – which focused exclusively on the time prior to Fetterman's stroke in May 2022 – showed that for nearly one-third of his workdays, he had an empty schedule.  An AP report said that days that had activity in Fetterman's schedule showed that the lieutenant governor only had four to five hours of work in a typical day. Fetterman's campaign took issue with the AP's observation. "This report is a misleading and inaccurate reflection of John’s actual schedule that totally fails to capture the breadth of his official work and his accomplishments," spokesman Joe Calvello told the AP. FETTERMAN FAILED TO PRESIDE OVER PENNSYLVANIA SENATE 33% OF THE TIME, BUT ATTENDED EVERY PARDONS BOARD MEETING The AP reported that Fetterman's 2021 schedule showed 115 days with no listed events or other activities. From late June to mid-September of that year, the report said, his schedule was "largely blank," showing only 11 hours of work accounted for. In 2022, prior to his stroke, Fetterman's schedule had 70 days with nothing on it. DEMOCRATS DEFEND FETTERMAN'S LACK OF PUBLIC APPEARANCES, DEBATES The main roles of the state's lieutenant governor include presiding over the state senate, chairing the Board of Pardons, and leading the governor's emergency management committee. Fox News Digital reported in September that Fetterman failed to preside over 33% of the state's Senate legislative sessions as lieutenant governor but holds a perfect attendance record with the Board of Pardons. Calvello pointed to the COVID-19 pandemic in addressing the absences to Fox News Digital. "John takes his constitutional duty serving as president of the Pennsylvania Senate incredibly seriously," Calvello said. "During the spring of 2020, beginning in March, much of the commonwealth, including John's home county of Allegheny, and Dauphin, the county where the state Capitol is located, were under restrictive red and yellow phases to stop the spread of COVID-19. After Allegheny County and Dauphin County returned to green phase status on June 19, Fetterman returned to presiding." In 2019, Fetterman marked a near-perfect attendance for legislative sessions held by the Senate, presiding over 48 of the 51 sessions. However, in 2020, amid the spread of COVID-19, Fetterman only appeared for 50% of the Senate's legislative sessions, presiding over 26 of the 52 that were held. The following year, in 2021, Fetterman presided over 42 of the 59 legislative sessions held by the Senate, marking a 21% increase from the year prior. As for the Pennsylvania Board of Pardons, which is chaired by Fetterman, the lieutenant governor has had perfect attendance at the quarterly meetings even after his stroke. According to documents obtained through a public records request that were reviewed by Fox News Digital, Fetterman attended every Board of Pardons meeting from March 2019 through December 2021, and video shows him in the April and August meetings this year. Fetterman also attended the June meeting of the board, a source confirmed to Fox News Digital, though video was not available for that meeting. Fetterman is in a tight race against Republican candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz.  Oz campaign communications director Brittany Yanick responded to the AP report by claiming that Fetterman's records both as lieutenant governor and in his prior role as mayor of Braddock, Pa., were marked by poor attendance. Not showing up for work was No Show Fetterman's trademark as Lieutenant Governor AND as Mayor of Braddock. He couldn't be trusted to show up and work for the people of Braddock or the people of Pennsylvania," Yanick said in a statement. "Pennsylvanians can't trust Fetterman to represent us in the U.S. Senate - his truly radical policies aside - after being absent from debates, in the media, and on the campaign trail for months. Clearly 'working' is not his thing, and he should go back to living off his parents." CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The last remark is in line with recent attacks from Oz accusing Fetterman of relying on his parents' wealth. Fetterman’s 2015 financial disclosure when he first ran for Senate showed that he collected just $1,800 a year as Braddock’s mayor while living off $54,000 given to him by his parents. According to property records, he purchased his home in Braddock from his sister for just $1. Fetterman and Oz are set to square off in a debate on October 25, two weeks before the November 8 election. Fox News' Kyle Morris contributed to this report.

Headline : Rising gas prices impact voters in key midterm state: 'Nobody signed up for this'
Corpus :  LAS VEGAS –At a gas station about a 15-minute drive from theLas Vegas Strip, drivers said higher prices are forcing them to make difficult choices. "It's really affecting my budget… I got to focus more on spending on gas," said one driver. "It seems like we definitely need to make some changes," said another driver when asked if inflation is motivating his vote. At an average of $5.54 a gallon for regular gasoline, Nevada is second to only California for the most expensive gas in the country, according to AAA. That average price is $1.65 higher than a year ago. Republicans have focused theirmidterm pitchto Nevada voters on inflation. In the state’s Senate race, former Attorney General Adam Laxalt is trying to unseat Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto. OCTOBER SURPRISE? WHY OPEC'S PLANNED PRICE HIKE COULD PUMMEL DEMOCRATS At a campaign event near Las Vegas, Laxalt said Democrats’ embrace of renewables over fossil fuels is to blame for the increase in gas prices. "Maybe the long term goal to get more renewables, that's fine. But our system is not ready for that today, and we are seeing the effects of that. We have all-time high gas prices here. Energy prices are on the rise," said Laxalt. "Nobody signed up for this." Analysts said Nevada typically has higher prices than other states because of a mix of taxes, lack of infrastructure and reliance on other states. Nationally,prices are elevated. A regular gallon of gas costs $3.83, according to AAA, which is $.063 more than a year ago. Democrats have pointed to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a driver behind higher gas prices. They have also pivoted to other issues, like abortion access. DEMOCRATS' MIDTERM TROUBLES IN NEVADA COUL MIRROR NATIONWIDE ISSUES AS ECONOMY BOLSTERS GOP: NEW YORK TIMES In a statement responding to Laxalt, Cortez Masto said: "While I’ve been working to lower costs for Nevadans, my opponent has been cashing in, defending the Big Oil companies profiting off high gas prices. Laxalt’s support for an abortion ban in Nevada is wrong, and I’m not going to let him drag us backwards." Laxalt says his opponent ishighlighting abortionto distract from the economy and inflation. "I would absolutely not vote for a federal ban," said Laxalt. "They're trying to use this as a battering ram in this state. But there's no scenario where there are 61 votes for an all-out federal ban on abortion." CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Cortez Masto’scampaign has outspentLaxalt’s by nearly a four-to-one margin, according to data compiled by OpenSecrets. Polls have shown this race is within the margin of error.

Headline : More than 150 House Republicans call on Biden to reject California's waiver request for green car regulations
Corpus :  FIRST ON FOX:Over 150 Republicans in the House of Representatives are calling on President Biden to reject California’s newradical green car regulationsas the state looks to electrify its citizens’ fleet. Rep. Bob Latta, R-Ohio., led the charge in a letter to Biden with nearly three-fourths of the entire House GOP urging the president to deny the State of California’s Air Resource Board (CARB) Clean Air Act waiver request for new regulations requiring car sellers tophase out gas-powered engines. CARB’s new regulations would require 35% of all car sales in the state to be electric vehicles by 2026 before completely phasing out internal combustion engines (ICEs) in new car sales by 2035. TWITTER RIPS GAVIN NEWSOM FOR POWER CONSERVATION PUSH AFTER ELECTRIC VEHICLE MANDATE: ‘DESTROYING THE STATE’ In order for the regulations to become enforceable, the Golden State needs a Clean Air Act preemption provisions waiver to give them the green light. House Republicans on the letter are calling on Biden to deny their waiver request. "Earlier this year, America’s energy regulators warned states about elevated risks to the reliability of our electric grid and the increased threat of brown and black outs," Latta said in a statement to Fox News Digital. "Instead of heeding those warnings, California politicians are pursuing stifling new regulations to ban gas- and diesel-powered cars by 2035," the congressman continued. "This effort will extend far beyond California’s borders and will make it more difficult for Americans to get to work, drop their kids off at school, and travel to visit loved ones." Latta said that one "cannot forget, California recently alerted residents to substantially reduce their energy consumption, and now, they are contradicting themselves by forcing folks to become more reliant on the electric grid through the mandatory transition from traditional vehicles to electric-only vehicles." "These actions are misguided and will further exacerbate the strain on our grid," Latta added. "California’s proposal is wrong; we must stand up now to preserve the reliability of our nation’s electric grid and the rights of Americans to choose the vehicles they want to drive." Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Fla., one of the letter’s co-leads, told Fox News Digital "California’s proposal is another example of liberal elitists being detached from the real constraints on the energy grid and the average American consumer." "This summer we already saw California’s energy grid struggle to meet growing energy demands, and these proposed regulations would only exacerbate that strain," Bilirakis said. "With the higher-than-average cost of an EV vehicle, the average Californian might find themselves not only unable to afford a new EV vehicle, but even if they are, potentially unable to keep it reliably charged due to brown or black outs." GAVIN NEWSOM BLASTED FOR ASKING CALIFORNIANS TO AVOID CHARGING ELECTRIC VEHICLES DURING HEAT WAVE "All Americans should have the freedom to choose which vehicle makes the most sense for their particular circumstances and budgets, and the EPA should not enable the Californian elite to set a precedent that could have negative impacts on all Americans," he added. Fellow co-lead Rep. John Joyce, R-Pa., warned "California’s discriminatory waiver request would set a costly and dangerous precedent." "Americans should not be coerced into making purchases they cannot afford, and they should be free to drive the roads built with their tax dollars in the vehicles they otherwise would choose to drive," Joyce said. "This heavy-handed proposal picks winners and losers, and I am proud to stand with my colleagues in urging the EPA to deny this outrageous request," he added. In the letter, the Republicans called on Biden to "reject California’s forthcoming request for this waiver due to widespread concerns for the negative impact it will have on the electric grid, the need for additional power generation, the overreliance on foreign adversaries for critical minerals, and the right of Americans to choose for themselves which vehicles they wish to drive." The lawmakers wrote it is "disconcerting that California is attempting to ban ICE vehicles when there have already been real world examples showing California’s grid will not be able to handle the increased electric load," pointing to the state government calling on residents tonot charge their electric vehiclesin the middle of a heat wave days after the policy announcement. "This included a call to set thermostats higher and avoid plugging in major appliances. Under the new ban on ICE vehicles and with the goal of full electrification, California residents may face a future where they will be unable to get to work, shop for groceries at the local market, or pick up their kids from school because they will be unable to charge their vehicles when they want or need." "These grid reliability concerns are so obvious that they cannot be ignored," Latta and the Republicans wrote, adding CARB’s goal to have a fully-electric fleet on the road means "the state would need to be able to generate enough electricity to continuously charge 30 million registered vehicles." "If the state’s electric grid is currently struggling to handle more demand for electricity, how will it be able to integrate the additional 2,250,000,000 kWhs it will need to charge its fleet (average 75 kWh electric vehicle battery)?" the lawmakers asked. Outside of the physical limitations of the power grid, the lawmakers warned the new policy "also fails to account for market realities" and pointed to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics’ numbers showing there are "just under 276 million registered vehicles operating in the United States in 2020." Latta and his colleagues also wrote that, through April 2022, "just over 2.3 million plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and battery electric vehicles (BEVs) have been sold cumulatively in the United States." "If the United States did go to an all-EV fleet, as California would like, then where is the plan to convert, recycle, or dispose of the 276 million registered vehicles that are already on the road? How will California stifle the preferences of Americans that would like to purchase new ICE vehicles due to their accessibility, affordability, and reliable infrastructure? These questions need answers." The Republicans also raised concerns with the source of materials critical to the production of electric vehicles, such as lithium-ion batteries, of which "China controls more than 70 percent of the world’s" production. They also wrote that "it seems the loudest supporters of EVs are also the loudest critics of building up our nation’s capacity to secure the materials right here at home." "This will help shorten supply chains, which were exposed for their vulnerability during the COVID-19 pandemic, and reduce the United States’ reliance on China, especially at a time when the latter is projecting military aggression in the South China Sea," the lawmakers wrote. "Unless the intention is to make it more difficult for Americans to travel and commute, it would be simply impossible to phase out ICE vehicles without addressing these critical mineral concerns," they added. Latta and his colleagues argued their raised issues "represent a small sample of the reasons why the EPA should reject California’s request for a waiver of the CAA presumption provisions." "Not only are there technical and logistical barriers, but also philosophical concerns with telling the American people what products they can and cannot buy," they concluded the letter. "We urge you to consider these concerns and allow them to inform EPA’s final decision on the waiver." CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Joining Latta, Bilirakis and Joyce on the letter are 155 of their fellow House Republicans, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana, House GOP Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik of New York, and House Energy and Commerce ranking member Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington. The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment on the letter.

Headline : Dems turn to hostile dictators for oil production as gas prices tick up, GOP blame 'war on American energy'
Corpus :  President Biden and Democratic lawmakers doubled down on the importance ofhostile actors boosting oil outputWednesday after a decision from a Saudi-led group to cut production. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the powerful Middle Eastern oil cartel, and its Russian counterpartannounced a massive production cutof 2 million barrels of oil per day, the largest reduction since the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020. In response, Democrats have unleashed their fury, noting the importance of oil production from the cartel comprised of dictators and hostile actors. "The President is disappointed by the shortsighted decision by OPEC+ to cut production quotas while the global economy is dealing with the continued negative impact of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine," the White House said in a statement Wednesday. "At a time when maintaining a global supply of energy is of paramount importance, this decision will have the most negative impact on lower- and middle-income countries that are already reeling from elevated energy prices," the statement continued. RISING GAS PRICES FUEL SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS AS BIDEN ADMIN ASKS FOR VENEZUELA'S HELP: 'VERY FRUSTRATING' The White House also announced Biden would order the Department of Energy to unleash another 10 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The president has already drained 280 million barrels from the emergency stockpile, taking it to its lowest level since 1984. Democratic lawmakers urged Biden to turn back to Saudi Arabia and beg them again for more oil. Bidentraveled to the Middle Eastern nationin July to discuss oil production. AMERICANS SHOULD PREPARE FOR GAS PRICES TO KEEP RISING, ANALYSTS WARN "There still is, in my view, an opportunity to persuade the Saudis that you're making a gigantic mistake here — and I hope the administration will be aggressive about it," Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told Politico. "We have an opportunity and an obligation to use the leverage available. We have agency here. And we should use it." "We have to stop acting like the suckers in this relationship, and reestablish that the services we provide to these countries require them to take our legitimate interests and concerns into account," Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-N.J., told Politico. "And if they're not willing to do that, then they should find another friend." And on Wednesday evening, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Biden administration was again looking to ease sanctions on Venezuela in exchange for more oil production. The White House reportedly engaged in oil negotiations with Venezuela in May. An agreement between the U.S. and Venezuela's government is expected by the end of October. BIDEN LOOKS EVERYWHERE TO LOWER GAS PRICES — EXCEPT BOOSTING OIL PRODUCTION "Just in case you haven’t noticed, our policy of sanctioning and isolating Maduro hasn’t worked," Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., tweeted Thursday. "At some point when your policy isn’t getting results, it’s malpractice to not try something else." However, Republicans blasted Biden and Democrats for cozying up to dictators for energy and urged increased domestic production. "You’ve got to be kidding me. Instead of pumping out clean oil from our own states, the Biden Admin is now easing sanctions on communist Venezuela to get its dirty oil," Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., tweeted following the WSJ report. "This Admin continues to place America last and embolden our adversaries." Earlier in the day, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., the top GOP member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, similarly slammed the Biden administration's energy policies which she said have led to increased reliance on foreign oil. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP "President Biden’s policies continue to drive the increases in gas prices that Americans will see after this production cut," she said in a statement. "His war on American energy has allowed OPEC and Russia to regain control of the global oil market." "Instead of flipping the switch for more American energy production and making us energy independent again, his administration has repeatedly chosen to beg authoritarian regimes, release strategic reserves for political expediency, and surrender our energy leadership for a rush-to-green agenda," she added. Meanwhile, the average price of gasoline nationwide increased to $3.87 a gallon on Thursday. Prices have been on the rise since mid-September and analysts have warned that consumers shouldn't expect relief anytime soon.

Headline : Arizona Senate showdown: Democratic Sen. Kelly and GOP challenger Masters face-off in their only debate
Corpus :  With just over a month to go untilNovember’s midterm elections,Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Republican nominee Blake Masters will share the same stage Thursday evening in their only debate in a crucial battleground state race that’s one of a handful which will likely determine if the GOP wins back the Senate majority. Kelly is a former astronaut who narrowly won election in 2020 to serve the final two years of the term of the late GOP Sen. John McCain, and Masters is a venture capitalist who’s heavily supported byformer President Donald Trump. The two frontrunners will join Libertarian nominee Marc Victor for the debate, hosted by Arizona PBS and the Arizona Citizens Clean Elections Commission. Kelly has crushed Masters when it comes to fundraising and currently holds a 3.9 point advantage over his Republican challenger according to an average of the most recent public opinion polls compiled by Real Clear Politics. The most recent Fox News poll in the state, conducted Sept. 22-26, indicated Kelly with a six-point lead over Masters. Masters in August captured the GOP Senate nomination in a crowded and combustible primary, thanks to the support of Trump. Masters strongly backed Trump's unproven claims that his 2020 election loss to President Biden was due to massive voter fraud. Arizona was one of the key swing states where Biden narrowly edged Trump two years ago. Also boosting Masters was the more than $15 million that his former boss, tech billionaire and PayPal founder Peter Thiel, poured into a super PAC backing Masters’ primary campaign. WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL IN BATTLEGROUND ARIZONA SHOWS The race in Arizonais one of the most expensive in the nation, with the campaigns, party committees, and allied outside groups dishing out over $120 million on ads so far this election cycle. Chuck Coughlin, veteran Arizona based political consultant, told Fox News that Masters clearly has the most to gain from the debate. THESE 11 SENATE RACES WILL DETERMINE WHICH PARTY CONTROLS THE MAJORITY "It’s a one-on-one opportunity with the incumbent U.S. Senator. Masters hasn’t had that before and there’s a need for him to put some runners on base," Coughlin said. "Kelly’s campaign has been disciplined. It’s been running the narrative that it wants to run and I think that Masters has been responding to the narrative rather than leading his own. It will be an opportunity for Masters to potentially try and turn the tables and put Kelly on the defensive for the first time." Coughlin said he expects Masters to go on the offensive on border security and immigration, which he said "are the biggest issues in Arizona," and inflation. "Arizona has some of the worst inflation in the country," he added. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And Coughlin noted he expects Kelly to argue "how can you believe what [Masters] says" after the GOP nominee has softened his position on banning abortion and on his support for Trump’s repeated re-litigation of the 2020 election. He also expects the senator to spotlight Masters comments criticizing America’s armed forces.

Headline : Hurricane Ian hero: Maryland firefighter uses his ham radio to send rescuers to Florida's Sanibel Island
Corpus :  Dale Klonin, a firefighter at Baltimore/Washington International Airportin Baltimore, was off duty and busy running errands last Wednesday when he stumbled upon a chance to save lives. Klonin, 46, lives in Hampstead, Maryland. As an amateur ham radio operator with an interest in "any news or weather event," he was keeping an eye and ear onHurricane Ian. "Of course, the hurricane was pretty big news," Klonin told Fox News Digital in a phone interview. HURRICANE IAN IN FLORIDA SPURS FRANTIC MESSAGES ABOUT MISSING LOVED ONES AND WRECKED HOMES Thinking aboutfamily memberswho live outside Sarasota, Florida, Klonin and his wife "were pretty concerned" about the storm, he said. Klonin has only been involved with ham radio — also called amateur radio — for about a year, he said. Ham radio is a popular hobby and service that people all over the world use "to talk across town, around the world or even into space, all without the Internet or cell phones," according to The American Radio Relay League website. "It's fun, social, educational and can be a lifeline during times of need," they note. Klonin was tuned into several networks, or "nets," on his ham radio system that morning. "I had the Florida Emergency and the National Hurricane Center Emergency nets monitored," he said. "A net is basically a frequency," he said. "A bunch of people are just listening in to see if there's anything going on, and one person acts as a controller. Every 10 minutes, someone comes on, and they're asking for emergency messages, damage reports and that kind of thing." HURRICANE IAN VICTIMS AND THOSE STILL IN ITS PATH RECEIVE BLESSINGS, PRAYERS AND HELP Klonin said that after monitoring the nets for most of the morning, he and his wife went to drop off her car for a tune-up at their regular shop in Hanover, Pennylvania, about 20 minutes away from his home. That afternoon, hewent to retrieve the car. As Klonin was settling the bill, he and Aly Ruiz, a service adviser, made small talk, he said. "I said something like, ‘How about this hurricane?’" he said. HURRICANE IAN DISASTER RELIEF: WAYS TO DONATE AS THE DEATH TOLL MOUNTS Ruiz shared with Klonin that her sister Kelsey, as well as Kelsey's boyfriend, were on Sanibel Island. "And she said, 'I haven't heard from her in four hours,’" Klonin said. "She showed me pictures [from their texts] — Kelsey’s boyfriend’s truck was completely submerged," said Klonin, adding that other photos revealed the floodwaters were coming up to the second floor of Kelsey’s boyfriend’s home. Klonin said that Ruiz told him,"My sister is really stubborn. She wasn't taking this whole thing seriously. I'm really worried about her." Klonin said he answered, "You know what? I'm an amateur radio operator. I've been listening to these networks all morning. Some of the emergency operation centers are listening. Let me try and get a message through, or at least let them know that these people might need help." Ruiz readily supplied all pertinent numbers for the stranded group, Klonin said, including the number for their Garmin inReach, a satellite communicator. "I initially just thought, 'If something bad were to happen or even something good, you know, if someone picks them up, they would know that they were being looked for and get back in touch with us [through ham radio communication]," Ruiz told Fox News Digital in a phone interview. FLORIDA WEATHER BLOGGER TALKS HURRICANE IAN AND HOW STORMS UNITE PEOPLE: ‘NEIGHBORS HELPING NEIGHBORS’ "But it was a much bigger deal," she continued. "He [Klonin] was in contact with people. I don't think I realized how much he could really help in this situation." Klonin, who has an inReach himself for hiking trips, said he uses his when cell phone communication may not be possible. "Hardly anybody I know has one," said Klonin, marveling that the group on Sanibel Island did have one. Klonin began his 20-minute drive home — and during the ride Ruiz texted him, saying her sister had reached out via the inReach. They were "safe, but stranded," explained Klonin. "Aly texted me again saying, ‘By the way, there's eight other people there [in their group on Sanibel] and a dog,'" Klonin said. "I've been a firefighter for 20 some years, and I teach emergency preparedness," said Klonin. "And I said, ‘Aly, I don't think they know how much danger there really is.’" Asking for a "better idea of where they are,"andknowing that the inReach could supply critical location coordinates, Klonin said he knew his job was not over. "So, she sent me those, I get on the radio and I call out to the Florida emergency net — and that controller comes back and acknowledges me," he said. HURRICANE IAN SLAMS FLORIDA AS SCHOOLS ACT AS SHELTERS: ‘READY TO ACCEPT ANYONE WITH OPEN ARMS,’ TEACHER SAYS "And I said, ‘Hey, I have someone here in Maryland, and they are receiving messages from their loved ones on Sanibel Island — the island is destroyed, their house is battered, and it's flooding. They may need possible rescue,’" Klonin continued. The Florida emergency net took all the information, said Klonin, and they in turn "brought up another station who took all the information, too,’" he added. He continued, "Florida State Emergency Operation Center called back and asked for more information" — and Klonin was soon emailing all the needed information over to them. "Before I was even done talking on the radio, the authorities knew exactly where they were," he said. "We continued offline, and I sent screenshots of all the text messages, and then Aly texted me." He continued, "She said, ‘They're OK. The authorities are texting with them.’" Klonin said people should know that ham radio operators are out there listening — and that they care. FLORIDA WIFE OF VETERAN, THEIR HOME WITHOUT POWER DUE TO HURRICANE IAN, SAYS ‘AMERICA WILL REBUILD’ "You know, ham radio operators do so much behind the scenes, and they never get any credit," he said. "How do you think the Cajun Navy gets their locations, in order to rescue people? Often, it is someone communicating on a ham radio." He added, "Usually the ham radio operators after a disaster are the ones that are getting in there and, through their networks, getting all the information until the authorities can get there. They do this out of the kindness of their hearts," he said. Ruiz said that before she knew her sister was safe, the situation had her "wildly upset and scared." She said, "I think that Dale could feel that, with him being a paramedic and a firefighter for so long — and he just turned to action." CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER She added, "I didn't ask him to do any of that. He offered. And he was in direct contact with me all night on Wednesday, back and forth, between not only just my family, but friends of my sisters who needed help and were looking for family and friends that had been on the island." CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Klonin’s wife has also been "wonderful," said Ruiz. "He’s taken a lot of time to be helping these people so far away, you know? And he's doing this out of his own kindness." "He just jumped into action, which is obviously in his character."

Headline : America's best Main Streets will compete for top honors: Is yours on this list?
Corpus :  Main Street America just announced its semifinalists for the 2023 Great American Main Street Award. The program, which gave out its first award in 1995, recognizescommunities across the United States that serve as a modelfor district revitalization. Since its start, the nonprofit has recognized over 100 Main Streets in the country. SMALL TOWN IN SOUTH DAKOTA STILL GRAPPLING WITH KEYSTONE CANCELLATION ONE YEAR LATER The award winners will be announced on March 27, 2023, during the Opening Plenary of the 2023 Main Street Now conferencein Boston, Massachusetts.(Last year three towns received the award.) Does your town have what it takes? Here are four of the eight semifinalists. Located in the south side region,Danville, Virginiais among the semifinalists for the 2023 Main Street award. Danville, Virginia, houses a leadership group called the River District Association — which has created an environment of economic strength in their Main Street district. ROMANCE IN AMERICA: 5 HONEYMOON DESTINATIONS IN THE USA WORTH CONSIDERING The organization has helped to improve business’ exteriors, develop an entrepreneurship environment, support small businesses in the area and overall increase commercial occupancy in the area. With over 150 businesses in its downtown, the Danville association is committed to increasing capacity and connections in this new and lively environment. Denison, Texas, located one mile south of the Texas-Oklahoma border, is home to just under 25,000 residents. It was the birthplace of President Dwight Eisenhower. Those in the town recognized that steps needed to be taken to manage economic growth in the area — and thus, Operation Increase Occupancy was born. FOR HIGH SCHOOL HOMECOMING, MUM'S THE WORD: SOUTHERN TRADITION TAKES OFF IN TEXAS IN A BIG WAY The program was created in 2011 to transform the town into a more vibrant space filled with retailers and entrepreneurs. The establishment of an entertainment district was important to support various outdoor activities. The organization credits its success in reviving the town to local history, heritage and arts organizations who worked together to help train volunteers. Main Street director Donna Dow told Fox News Digital the town is honored to be on the exclusive list. "We have significant development occurring in our downtown, and we feel we are well-positioned to succeed. We have spent years preparing for this growth," she said. Main Street in Denison, Texas, is among one of the semifinalists for this year’s award. About an hour and a half west of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, lies the small town of Florence — population 38,000. With its downtown comprised of just eight blocks, Florence’s Main Street district is quite small. MICHIGAN MAN PROPOSES TO HIS GIRLFRIEND WITH A SWEETGREEN SALAD Even so, it's architecturally unique — and the Main Street district has distinctive shopping, craftsman residential neighborhoods and early 19th and 20th century commercial buildings. The volunteer program within the town is strong; dedicated volunteers contribute to consistent improvement and excellence. Downtown Florence's Main Street program director Hannah Davis said in a statement to Fox News Digital that this is a testament to the hard work and dedication of the community. "Making it this far is a true testament to the work and dedication of our entire community, fromsmall business ownersto elected officials, residents and businesses," she said. The small-town Main Street is one of the semifinalists for the 2023 Great American Main Street Award. This Middlesex County suburban borough is known for supporting small businesses. The Metuchen Downtown Alliance hosted its first retail promotion in 2016 with Small Business Saturday deals — and now, six years later, the town’s Main Street is booming. Fox News Digital spoke with the mayor of Metuchen, Jonathan Busch, about the success of the town. "There was a time in the not-so-distant past where Metuchen’s downtown felt isolated and struggled with vacancies. Now it is a vibrant, active ‘place to be’ in Central Jersey," he said. LONG WEEKEND IN NASHVILLE: MUSIC CITY TOURISM BOOM LED BY THRIVING NIGHTLIFE The town offers multicultural celebrations, holiday contests, a winter market and themed promotional days. Busch said the town does "community" best. "Here we have a downtown built for the future … The downtowns of America once struggled to compete with big box shopping malls, but times have shifted," he said. Residents of the town say growth over the years has been huge. Karen Logan has been a long-time resident of Metuchen, N.J. She said her husband owns a business on Main Street. "My mom and I always reminisce about how Main Street has changed over the years and I think it’s better than ever," she said. Another resident, Amber Stiles, told Fox News Digital, "We left during the pandemic, realized our mistake and came back to Metuchen in March 2022. It’s the best downtown and community." She added, "Metuchen is a special place and truly where we belong." Fun fact about Metuchen, N.J.: Well-known magician and illusionist David Copperfield is from Metuchen — and often credits the town for his success. His dad once owned a business on Main Street. Metuchen is one of eight semifinalists up for the award. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Main Street America is a program of the nonprofit National Main Street Center, Inc., a subsidiary of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Additional semifinalists for the 2023 Great American Main Street Award will be profiled in a future piece in Fox News Digital.

Headline : Hurricane Ian disaster relief: Ways to donate as the death toll mounts
Corpus :  Hurricane Ian cut a path of destruction through Florida and other southern states as it barreled through, makinglandfall in southwest Floridaas a category 4 storm. Thepowerful hurricanewashed out bridges and piers, pushed massive boats into buildings onshore and sheared roofs off homes — leaving millions without power and forcing them to seek shelter in unfamiliar places. As of right now, more than 50 people have died due to Hurricane Ian. Florida has at least 47 deaths confirmed in the state, while four deaths were confirmed in North Carolina and three in Cuba. DEATH TOLL FROM IAN: STORM-CAUSED CROSSES 50 PEOPLE The need is great. Here are some options for making a donation to help those suffering loss and devastation in the wake of the storm. FOX Corporation has announced that it is donating$1 million to the American Red Crossto support the response to Hurricane Ian that left parts of Florida devastated, the company announced on Thursday. HURRICANE IAN SLAMS FLORIDA AS SCHOOLS ACT AS SHELTERS: ‘READY TO ACCEPT ANYONE WITH OPEN ARMS,’ TEACHER SAYS FOX Corporation is encouraging Fox News viewers and Fox News Digital readers to contribute to the effort, too. Donations to the American Red Cross help the organization provide food and shelter to families affected by the hurricane, provide medical care for anyone that needs it and assess damage and help families to develop recovery plans — along with a host of other services. You can donate to the Red Cross by visiting:www.redcross.org/foxforward. You can also ask your Alexa for help; simply say, "Alexa, make a donation to the Red Cross." Or scan the QR code (shown a few lines above) to make a donation. The Salvation Army provides "food, drinks, shelter, emotional and spiritual care and other emergency services" to hurricane survivors and rescue workers, its website notes. FLORIDA WIFE OF VETERAN, THEIR HOME WITHOUT POWER DUE TO HURRICANE IAN, SAYS ‘AMERICA WILL REBUILD’ When you support Salvation Army disaster services, "100% of your donation is applied to the disaster relief operation you select," according to the group's website. The organization never applies an administrative fee to any gift, it says. "If disaster donations exceed identified needs," the group says, "excess funds will be restricted to support future disaster services." Ways to donate include through the website (https://www.salvationarmyusa.org) or by phone: 1-800-SAL-ARMY (1-800-725-2769). Samaritan’s Purse is a nondenominationalevangelical Christian organizationthat provides spiritual and physical aid to hurting people around the world, as the group's website shares. It is run byRev. Franklin Graham, a son of Billy Graham. HURRICANE IAN CAUSING ‘EMOTIONAL TRAUMA’ ON TOP OF PHYSICAL DEVASTATION, SAYS DOCTOR Samaritan's Purse has two disaster relief units — tractor trailers stocked with equipment and supplies — that traveled from North Carolina (the group's headquarters) to Florida. Their bases of operation are "Citygate Ministries in Fort Myers and Calvary Baptist Church in Englewood," according to the website. HURRICANE IAN IN FLORIDA SPURS FRANTIC MESSAGES ABOUT MISSING LOVED ONES AND WRECKED HOMES "The damage is incredible — these people need our prayers and our support," Rev. Graham said in a message shared on the group's website. Samaritan’s Purse is also calling for volunteers to help with storm recovery efforts. "We’re going to need an army of volunteers. Prayerfully consider joining us to help in Jesus' Name," the website says. "Teams will mud-out flooded homes, cut downed trees, remove debris, and tarp roofs. Day volunteers can start Saturday, Oct. 1." To donate via the group's website, visit: https://samaritanspurse.org/our-ministry/hurricane-ian/. The Florida Disaster Fund is the State of Florida’s official private fund established to assist Florida’s communities as they respond to and recover from emergencies and disasters, according to its website. HURRICANE IAN VICTIMS AND THOSE STILL IN ITS PATH RECEIVE BLESSINGS, PRAYERS AND HELP "In partnership with the public sector, private sector and other non-governmental organizations, the Florida Disaster Fund supports response and recovery activities," it says. Donations to the Florida Disaster Fund are made to the Volunteer Florida Foundation, a 501(c)(3) charitable organization and are tax-deductible. While administrative costs are typically taken from donations, 100 % of Hurricane Ian donations will be used to help Floridians recover, the website explains. The Florida Disaster Fund distributes funds received to service organizations that will serve people within their communities. Donations can be made directly through the website: https://www.volunteerflorida.org/donatefdf/. For those who want to target their giving tohunger relief effortsin the wake of Hurricane Ian, Feeding Florida’s efforts are centered on the State of Florida; the network serves the whole state. "Feeding Florida is Florida's only statewide hunger-relief organization continuously serving all 67 counties," the group shares on its website. "We work with our community supported member food banks located in every corner of the state." It adds, "In our response to Hurricane Ian, we are working closely with the food banks in our network to provide food, water and resources to those affected." The group advises donating food and other supplies directly to a local food bank, if you are in Florida. You can find them on this page: https://www.feedingflorida.org/florida-food-banks. You can also donate through that website as well. Looking to help outanimals in perildue to Hurricane Ian? The Humane Society may be your choice. "The Emergency Animal Relief Fund is a continuing [and] dedicated fund that enables the Humane Society of the United States to help animals impacted by disasters or otherwise in need of urgent rescue," their website states. Here is a snapshot of some of the things they are able to do, thanks to donations: Rescue, care for and provide temporary shelter to animals in need Rent and outfit temporary animal-sheltering facilities Purchase, rent and outfit rescue vehicles, including trucks and boats BEAUTIFUL BRINDLE DOG AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION IN NEW JERSEY: ‘OLD SCHOOL’ CHARMER Provide long-term care for rescued animals; transport them to placement partner. Help lost and displaced animals and reunite them with their families You can visit them at https://www.humanesociety.org. An important consideration before donating is the following: Beware of scammers who create fake charities during natural disasters, says the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on its website. Always verify a charity's legitimacy through its official website — and if you have any doubt, check with Better Business Bureau's Wise Giving Alliance, Charity Navigator, Charity Watch or Guidestar, the FCC notes. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP You can also check with the National Association of State Charity Officials. Charities must be registered in their state.

Headline : Democrat Cori Bush doubles down on 'defunding the police' while on CNN: 'Absolutely' still supports
Corpus :  Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., defended the progressive push to "defund the police" Wednesday on CNN, after hostDon Lemonquestioned if the slogan hurt Democrats. The CNN host first brought up the "strong backlash" to defunding the police affecting November's midterm elections before asking the congresswoman if she still stood by the controversial platform. "As you know, there’s a pretty strong backlash to things like defund the police. I know you’ve been getting a lot of questions about this. For example, did defund the police — did progressives go too far in hurting Democratic chances in the far with — in the fall, with slogans like ‘defund the police?’" he posed. But Bush disagreed that the phrase damaged Democrats politically. "[T]here is no data that actually shows that saying 'defund the police' cost actual elections," she began, saying how candidates campaigned and used "digital technology," was to blame for lost seats. TOP DEMOCRAT RIPPED FOR CLAIMING LEADING DEMS DON'T SUPPORT DEFUNDING POLICE When pressed, she didn't hesitate to support the movement again. "If you could do it again, would you still double down or use that slogan, ‘defund the police?’" Lemon asked. "Absolutely," the Democrat responded. But some Democrats like Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., have pinned blame on the controversial slogan for his party losing congressional seats in the 2020 election. "That phrase, 'defund the police,'cost [Democratic Senate candidate] Jaime Harrison tremendously," he told Axios, shortly after the election. "Stop sloganeering. Sloganeering kills people," he told the outlet. Last yearClyburn told the New York Timesthat the phrase had "cut the throats" of his party, and his constituents didn't agree with it. REP. CORI BUSH TOUTS ‘MOMENTUM’ HEADING INTO ‘ROEVEMBER,’ SAYS DEMOCRATS WILL KEEP THE HOUSE Since 2020, the Democratic Party has tried to distance themselves from the progressive movement. As voters listrising crimeas a major concern heading into the midterm elections, some Democrats have tried to frame Republicans as the anti-law enforcement party. Bush did as well, bringing up the January 6 Capitol riot. "[W]e have Republicans saying defund the FBI. You know, where are we — where is our narrative? Let me tell you this. Democrats — there were not Democrats scaling walls on January the 6th when I was at the Capitol… Democrats didn'tkill police officers," the Democrat told Lemon. Bush was referring to some calls on the right to "defund the FBI" following the raid of Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago home. Former Vice President Mike Pence and several GOP members of Congress have pushed back against this sentiment. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

Headline : House Dems introducing GOP-inspired bill to strip defenses from Saudi Arabia, UAE following OPEC oil cut
Corpus :  Three House Democrats are introducing a bill to remove U.S. defense systems from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in response to the OPEC+ decision to cut oil production by 2 million barrels per day – a move that is expected to drive upgas pricesin the U.S. Reps. Tom Molinowski, D-N.J., Sean Casten, D-Ill., and Susan Wild, D-Pa., called outSaudi Arabiaand the UAE – both OPEC members – after President Biden had tried to work with them. The House members said the U.S. needs to reevaluate its relationship with both nations. "Saudi Arabia and the UAE’s drastic cut in oil production, despite President Biden’s overtures to both countries in recent months, is a hostile act against the United States and a clear signal that they have chosen to side with Russia in its war against Ukraine," the three Democrats said in a joint statement. "Both countries have long relied on an American military presence in the Gulf to protect their security and oil fields. We see no reason why American troops and contractors should continue to provide this service to countries that are actively working against us. If Saudi Arabia and the UAE want to help Putin, they should look to him for their defense." The House members went on to callOPEC’s decision"a turning point in our relationship with our Gulf partners" and said that if the UAE and Saudi Arabia want to continue having a relationship with the U.S., they need to work with the U.S. "in advancing what is now our most urgent national security objective: the defeat of Russia's aggression in Ukraine." They claimed that "by significantly boosting global oil prices, OPEC’s decision appears designed to increase Russia’s oil export revenues, enabling Putin to continue his war crimes in Ukraine, and undercutting Western sanctions." OPEC OIL CUTS MEAN HIGHER GAS PRICES: KEVIN BOOK Their bill, the "Strained Partnership Act," takes its name and virtually all of its language from a 2020 bill sponsored by Republican Sens. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., and Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska. Both bills call for the removal of "[a]ll United States Armed Forces and equipment, including Patriot missile batteries and the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system" from Saudia Arabia within 90 days of the bill’s enactment. The only difference between the two bills is the new one from the Democrats says the defenses should also be removed from the United Arab Emirates. OPEC CUTS ARE ‘REALLY BAD NEWS’ FOR AMERICAN CONSUMERS, SAYS API PRESIDENT The bill, like its predecessor, says that the removed missile batteries and THAAD system should be "to the extent practicable, be relocated to another location or locations in the Middle East, with the priority mission of protecting United States Armed Forces." CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP American Petroleum Institute President Mike Sommers called the OPEC cut "really bad news for American consumers" in a Wednesday appearance on "America's Newsroom." Sommers blamed theBiden administrationfor having the U.S. rely on foreign oil, saying it "was a choice" for the U.S. to be "about a million barrels of production down from where we were in 2019."

Headline : Wisconsin's rising crime caused by Tony Evers 'weak leadership': GOP candidate Tim Michels
Corpus :  GREEN BAY, Wis. –Wisconsin gubernatorial candidate Tim Michels blamed Gov. Tony Evers' "weak leadership" for rising crime and promised to work with law enforcement to curb violence if elected in the November midterm. Evers and Michels arelocked in a tight racewith the Republican challenger up 50%-47% and holds a seven-point lead among independents, according to an AARP survey released last week. The two are scheduled to debate Oct. 14. "We've had a tremendous spike in crime in this state in the last two years," Michels, an Army veteran, said. "One of the reasons we have this spike is because we have weak leadership in the governor's office right now." The Evers campaign did not respond to a request for an interview. DUELING WISCONSIN SENATE CANDIDATES WANT TO ‘SUPPORT LAW ENFORCEMENT’ IN KEY MIDTERM STATE Wisconsin saw 321 homicides in 2021, reflecting a more than 70% increase since 2019, according toWisconsin Department of Justicedata. Aggravated assault rose 12% over the same period, but robberies dropped 10% and rapes remained about even. APolitico/Morning Consult pollpublished Wednesday found that 94% of registered voters felt that crime was a problem in the U.S. "It's so imperative for our communities to function properly, function safely," Michels said. "We are going to get rule of law back in the state of Wisconsin." Michels called his Democratic rival soft on crime and criticized his response to theKenosha riots in 2020.Evers, after the city fell into violence and destruction following the police shooting of Jacob Blake, didn't deploy the Nation Guard until 3 a.m. The Republican also criticized Evers' parole policies that have allowed convicted felons out of prison early. "Tony Evers made a campaign pledge four years ago to cut in half the prison population, and he's well on his way to doing that after last year," Michels said. "Society is not safer because of this mass release that Tony Evers has been doing." WISCONSIN GOV. TONY EVERS PROPOSES 4% INCREASE INTO LOCAL FUNDING FOR PUBLIC SAFETY 5 WEEKS BEFORE ELECTION Evers, as part of his 2018 campaign pledge to reform parole, promised toonly release non-violent offendersearly. More than 880 criminals were released early for parole between 2019 and 2021, including 274 murderers or attempted murderers, according to Wisconsin Parole Commission data obtained byWisconsin Right Nowthrough an open records request. "They're on the streets of Wisconsin today," Michels said. CRIME TRUMPS ABORTION IN VOTER CONCERNS, GIVING GOP LARGEST LEAD ON ISSUE IN MORE THAN 30 YEARS: POLL The Republican met with Wisconsin sheriffs in Green Bay on Sept. 30 to discuss methods for crime reduction. Oconto County Sheriff Todd Skarban told Fox News a rise in drug use, specifically fentanyl, has contributed to rising crime. "Violent crime has increased exponentially," Skarban said. "When you have drugs in your community like that, it's going to increase property crime and increases violent crime." Opioid drug deathsnationwide surpassed 70,000 in 2021, with all drug overdose deaths increasing by nearly 15% from 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Skarban said overdose deaths have drastically risen in Oconto County. WISCONSIN PARENTS LOSE SON TO FENTANYL, BEG OTHER FAMILIES TO KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT THE DEADLY DRUG "It's unheard of, what we've seen in Oconto County, in my tenure of 25 years of working for the sheriff's office," Skarban said. He told Fox News law enforcement officials and state leaders should collaborate to address the spike in violence. Milwaukee is one of five major U.S. cities on pace tosurpass their homicide totalsfrom 2021, according to crime data analyzed by Fox News. As of June, the Cream City was leading the pack with a 25% year-over-year increase. "It's astronomical, a lot of the stuff that we're having to tackle today," Skarban said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Michels told Fox News the"defund the police" movement worsened crime rates. "Right now, there seems to be an attitude in society that less cops is better, or that police are bad," Michels said. "We're going to have a cultural shift here in Wisconsin," Michels said. "I'm going to let everyone know that police are happy to be respected."

Headline : Federal appeals court rules Obama-era DACA program illegal, buts says 600,000 already in US can stay
Corpus :  A federal appeals court determined that the Obama administration didn't have the authority to institute the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program but declined to dismantle it, allowing more than 600,000 immigrants to continue to enjoy its protections. The 5th U.S. Circuit ordered a review of new changes by theBiden administrationto DACA, telling aTexas federal judgeto review the program. A three judge panel from the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also ruled that while the Obama administration lacked the authority to create the immigration policy which affects over 600,000 people, it didn't dismantle the program, and people can continue benefiting from the policy. The panel ruled that the U.S. government cannot process new applicants for individuals seeking DACA benefits. BIDEN ADMIN MOVES TO STRENGTHEN OBAMA-ERA DACA PROGRAM AMID LEGAL CHALLENGES "A district court is in the best position to review the administrative record in the rulemaking proceeding and determine whether our holdings as to the 2012 DACA Memorandum fully resolve issues concerning the Final Rule," the opinion states. Several Republican-led states are suing the U.S. government, arguing that they are being harmed financially by spending hundreds of millions of dollars on services such as education and health care for people who are being allowed to stay in the U.S. illegally. BIDEN CALLS DACA RULING ‘DEEPLY DISAPPOINTING,' URGES CONGRESS TO PASS CITIZENSHIP PATH The Biden administration presented changes to DACA in August which were open to public comments, but don't contain substantial modifications to the Obama-era policy and are pointed at legal challenges in relation to the program. The rule would begin on Oct. 31. In July 2021, U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen ruled that DACA was illegal and said that it wasn't put through public notice and comment, which is a requirement by the federal Administrative Procedures Act. When President Biden took office in 2021, he signed a memo aiming to protect DACA and ordered the Department of Homeland Security to take "all appropriate actions under the law" to protect the program. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement that he's disappointed by the ruling. "I am deeply disappointed by today’s DACA ruling and the ongoing uncertainty it creates for families and communities across the country. We are currently reviewing the court’s decision and will work with the Department of Justice on an appropriate legal response," Mayorkas said. "As a result of the stay that remains in place, no one who currently has DACA will lose their protection from removal or work authorization. Consistent with that stay, DHS will continue to accept the filing of both initial and renewal DACA applications, but will process only the DACA renewal requests." The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Headline : Democratic candidate running in toss-up race called to end oil and gas 'immediately,' said 'shut it all down'
Corpus :  FIRST ON FOX:A Democratic candidate for Congress fromNew Mexicois looking to walk back recently unearthed comments he previously made indicating he supported ending oil and gas extraction "immediately." Gabe Vasquez, a former city council member of Las Cruces, New Mexico, said in 2018 he agreed with environmentalists who sought to get rid of oil and gas extraction "immediately" in favor of renewable energy. As the Novembermidterm electionsapproach, Vasquez has recently called the oil and gas industry "incredibly important to this district" not just for the extraction companies themselves, but for the small businesses that support the fossil fuel industry. Vasquez, who is running against incumbent Republican Rep. Yvette Herrell in the 2nd Congressional District that covers most of the southern half of New Mexico, said on his "Nuestra Tierra Conservation Podcast" several years ago that he agreed with environmental groups who say, "Shut it all down. Let's just get rid of it immediately." PELOSI-BACKED CANDIDATE WHO ATTACKED US AS 'AMERIKKKA' AND CALLED TO 'DECONSTRUCT' POLICE WINS DEM PRIMARY However, he also criticized some in the environmental movement who ignored local communities' reliance on oil and gas industries for their survival. "In the very statement referenced, I make absolutely clear that my top priority is protecting the livelihoods of New Mexicans and that I will not support any transition to sustainable energy that leaves working people who rely on the oil and gas industry behind," Vasquez told Fox News Digital on Wednesday in a statement. "We can continue to produce oil and gas responsibly, protect the health of our workers and our environment, and add even more jobs in the southeast by expanding our renewable energy production." The podcast is no longer available on iTunes, but audio of the episode shared with Fox News matches an episode archived on Backtracks.fm, a podcast analytics website. In it, Vasquez does not appear to indicate that oil and gas should continue to be produced responsibly, but he indicates thatfossil fuel extractionshould be ended in a way that supports local economies in the transition. "A lot of folks in the environmental community will say, 'Shut it all down. Let’s just get rid of it immediately, let’s put in the infrastructure to get clean energy.’ And I agree with that. Because, as a planet, we need to move in that direction," Vasquez said in one episode of the podcast that aired March 27, 2018. Vasquez went on to say that a shift away from fossil fuels would need heavy infrastructure buildup in renewable energy sources to ensure communities that rely on current extraction industries would have opportunities for employment. "We also have to figure out a way to make sure that our people in these small towns and in these economies have an opportunity for job retraining, have an opportunity to be the ones installing those windmills or manufacturing those solar panels. And that's, I think, some of the thing that gets lost on some of the larger environmental community," he said. BIDEN CONTRADICTS HIS OWN TOP HURRICANE EXPERT TO PUSH CLIMATE AGENDA Later in the podcast, Vasquez agreed with his guest, New Mexico state Rep. Angelica Rubio, and otherenvironmental groups,saying, "We do have to end it all," referring to fossil fuel-based energy. He also bemoaned how entrenched oil and gas production was in the state's economy. "I think this is where I get really frustrated with our legislature and with just the state of the world in terms of our politics here in New Mexico is because oil and gas is such a big part of our way of thinking. And our way of thinking is that we’ve also become very short-sighted in terms of our vision and how we think about things and moving forward in terms of economic development," Vasquez said. The New Mexico Oil and Gas Association says the industry supported 134,000 jobs in the state in 2021. Vasquez said in August that, if elected, he would be a voice for oil and gas workers in New Mexico, rather than support corporate extraction industries. "My approach is that we can’t line the pockets of the corporations and the CEOs at the expense of the health of the communities," he said, according to the Carlsbad Current-Argus. "In Congress, I do want to hold the oil and gas companies accountable for not making some of the investments I believe they should be making in reducing methane emissions." CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Herrell, Vasquez's opponent in the race, saidthe economy is not readyto give up all fossil fuels, given all the industries it supports. "We all take for granted the fossil fuel industry, the products that come out of that space," Herrell said. "Let’s get our energy from where it's cleaner and better for the environment. We’re not ready to go all green."

Headline : Last minute changes to Biden’s student loan handout make it harder to challenge in court: Experts
Corpus :  The sudden decision to cut out more than 700,000 borrowers fromPresident Biden's $400 billion student loanhandout could make it harder for opponents of that policy to challenge it in court, and some say the change appears to have been made precisely for that reason. Soon after Biden's policy was announced, officials saidloan forgiveness would only apply to borrowerswho consolidated their debts under the Department of Education. That last-minute change made more than 700,000 borrowers ineligible for the handout because their loans are still managed by private companies. Just before that change was announced, Nebraska and five other states filed a lawsuit arguing that their finances would be adversely hit by the handout. These states argued they had standing to sue because millions of dollars in public pension funds are invested in private companies that manage many of these student loans, and that Biden's program would hurt these companies and lead to lower returns. Legal experts told Fox News Digital that by making loans managed by these companies ineligible for forgiveness, the Biden administration may have stripped the six states of any standing in court, and likely helped the policy survive an early court challenge. WHITE HOUSE SUGGESTS BIDEN'S $500B STUDENT LOAN HANDOUT WILL BE PAID FOR WITH DEFICIT SPENDING "By getting rid of the privately-backed loans, they probablycut off the right to suefrom certain investors, financial institutions, and state governments who could argue they would be negatively impacted by the proposal," said Jack Fitzhenry, a legal policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation. "This makes it a lot harder for states and companies managing the privately-held debt to sue over lost revenue," said Fitzhenry. Policy experts said this is not the first time the White House has revised the parameters of the handout in response to legal attacks. One of the first legal challenges filed against the handout was from a borrower who would have to pay taxes on the handout because their state of residence considers debt cancelation as income. STATE AGS WEIGH LEGAL CHALLENGE TO BIDEN'S $500B STUDENT LOAN HANDOUT "When that lawsuit was filed, there was no indication that borrowers could opt out on the official website set up to provide information," said Beth Akers, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. "After the lawsuit, the website was updated to say you could opt out and that might be enough to nix the lawsuit." The White House has revised the handout proposal several times since Biden first announced in August plans to forgive up to $10,000 for borrowers making less than $125,000 annually, and up to $20,000 for people in families earning less than $250,000. The revisions have been heavily criticized by policy experts, some of whom have argued the administration seemed unprepared to roll out the program. Now some say that maybe the White House's tactics are more strategic than first appear. BIDEN STUDENT LOAN HANDOUT TO COST MORE THAN $400 BILLION: CBO CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP "I think it's a mistake to look at all the apparent chaos and conclude that none of its intentional," said Fitzhenry. "Not all of it is intentional, but at least a some seems to be strategic. They're fine-tuning the proposal in real time to make sure it lasts."

"No one f---- with a Biden," the president appeared to tell Fort Myers Beach Mayor Ray Murphy. "Yeah, you're go----- right," the mayor replied while laughing. The president and first lady Jill Biden visitedFisherman’s Wharf in Fort Myers, where homes and businesses were destroyed by Hurricane Ian last week.
