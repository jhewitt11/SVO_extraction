    "Abortion Was Always Going To Impact The Midterms": [
        "By Mary Radcliffe and Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux",
        " Abortion turned out to be a driving force in midterm races across the country, helping Democrats maintain control of the Senate and limit their losses in the House. But if you were following news coverage in the lead-up to the election, the impact of abortion may have come as quite a surprise. In the month before the election, multiple major media outlets reported that voters\u2019 outrage over the Supreme Court\u2019s June decision overruling Roe v. Wade was fading. Inflation, not abortion, seemed to be rising in importance, making Democrats\u2019 focus on abortion look like a risky gamble. \u201cThe debate over abortion rights has not emerged as a political silver bullet for Democrats,\u201d reporters for The New York Times wrote on Nov. 4. Why did election results diverge so dramatically from the media narrative in the last month of campaigning? It turns out that clues to this outcome were present in the polling all along. As the election grew closer, several tracking polls showed that abortion was not receding in importance for voters, particularly Democrats. Inflation generally ranked higher when voters were asked which issues were most important for the country, but abortion remained important for Democrats throughout the summer and fall. And the share of voters who said the issue was motivating their vote actually rose between July and September, according to one pollster. Abortion was also an issue where Democrats were especially unwilling to compromise and vote for a candidate with whom they disagreed \u2014 unlike inflation. And in places where abortion was directly on the ballot, voters were particularly likely to say they were casting their ballot based on abortion.\u00a0 Together, all of this suggests that while most people perceived the economy as a more pressing concern generally, abortion was a motivating issue for a substantial number of voters \u2014 and their enthusiasm may have helped give Democrats an edge in the election. Consistently asking the same question over and over again is one of the best ways to see if public opinion is changing. According to weekly polls by YouGov/The Economist, abortion started growing in importance months ago, particularly after a draft of the opinion overturning Roe v. Wade leaked in early May.\u00a0  The polls found that the share of respondents who said abortion was a \u201cvery important\u201d issue for the U.S. rose even more after the official ruling in June, particularly among Democrats. Abortion was ranked as \u201cvery important\u201d by between 57 and 68 percent of Democrats every single week after the decision came down, suggesting the issue was not fading from voters\u2019 minds. (This was a continuation of a longer trend: Previous FiveThirtyEight analysis showed that abortion started gaining in importance for Democrats as early as September 2021, when Texas banned the procedure after approximately six weeks of pregnancy.) At the same time, the issue of inflation was also important to voters \u2014 in fact, it was more consistently rated as \u201cvery important\u201d than abortion in the YouGov/The Economist polls. In July, when 51 percent of Americans said abortion was \u201cvery important\u201d \u2014 the highest level of concern for abortion the survey ever measured \u2014 68 percent of Americans, including 58 percent of Democrats, said that inflation and prices were a \u201cvery important\u201d issue. And notably, among Democrats, the two issues were ranked as \u201cvery important\u201d by similar numbers of respondents throughout the summer and fall, suggesting that Democratic voters were concerned about both. Despite talk of inflation overtaking abortion as a priority, the percentage of Americans who ranked it among their top concerns remained pretty steady throughout the fall. For example, in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s own polling conducted with Ipsos, between 9 and 13 percent of respondents ranked abortion as a top three issue in every survey conducted after the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision leaked in May. In those same surveys, the issue of inflation was ranked as a top three issue by between 55 and 63 percent of respondents. Reporting and analysis focused on the fact that concern over inflation was far more widespread than concern over abortion, taking that as a signal that the issue was fading in importance. The fact that there was no substantial change in how respondents viewed either issue from June through October was largely ignored. But crucially, the share of people who said that abortion was a key reason to vote \u2014 rather than just an important issue \u2014 seemed to grow as the election season went on. After all, concern about an issue doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into voter enthusiasm, and some Americans who said inflation was their top concern overall may have been more influenced by abortion when they cast their ballot. In September, polling from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that the number of voters who said the Dobbs decision made them more motivated to vote had increased from their previous survey in July, from 43 to 50 percent. The September survey also found that Democrats were more than twice as likely as Republicans to say that the Dobbs decision was motivating their vote. And in KFF\u2019s analysis of midterm exit polls, 38 percent of voters said that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade had a major impact on their decision to vote \u2014 including 57 percent of Democrats \u2014 which was much higher than the share of voters who said abortion was their top concern in pre-election polling. Moreover, abortion was more likely to be a dealbreaker issue for voters \u2014 one where they were unwilling to compromise and vote for a candidate with whom they disagreed. In a Fox News survey conducted in mid-October, for example, voters were asked an open-ended question to identify an issue that \u201cis so important to them that they must agree with a candidate on it, or they will NOT vote for them.\u201d Twenty-one percent of registered voters named abortion, while only 6 percent named inflation and 8 percent named the economy more generally. This was especially true among Democrats: Twenty-nine percent of Democratic voters said they would not vote for a candidate they disagreed with about abortion, compared with just 15 percent of Republicans. The idea that abortion is a particularly important issue for Democrats isn\u2019t new. In research conducted between 2019 and 2021, political scientists John Sides, Chris Tausanovitch and Lynn Vavreck ran a series of experiments to determine which issues voters prioritize. They offered subjects choices between candidates who agreed with some of their positions, but not others, to find where voters might be willing to compromise. According to their surveys, 75 percent of Democrats opposed total abortion bans, and it was one of the issues on which they were least willing to compromise. Only 29 percent of Republicans, meanwhile, supported total abortion bans, and the issue of abortion was much more important to that small group than to the much larger slice of Republicans who opposed total abortion bans, or were unsure.  And tucked within the preelection polling is some regional variation that sheds light on how abortion may have played an outsized role in certain states or races. In the September Kaiser Family Foundation survey, voters in states where abortion had been fully or near-fully banned after Dobbs were 19 points more likely to say abortion laws motivated them to turn out than voters in states where abortion was protected. Emerson College conducted surveys in dozens of states this cycle. In their final October surveys, the issue of abortion access was significantly more salient in some key states, particularly Michigan. Likely voters were asked, \u201cWhich of the following issues is most important in determining your vote this November?\u201d Among the 9 options offered to respondents were \u201cabortion access\u201d and \u201ceconomy (jobs, inflation, taxes).\u201d  Across the board, more voters said that economic issues were most important for determining their vote. But Michigan voters were especially likely to prioritize abortion, and it\u2019s easy to guess why. The state\u2019s abortion laws were up in the air following Dobbs, and a constitutional amendment that would guarantee abortion access was on the ballot, so voters had the opportunity to decide whether abortion would remain legal in their state. Not only did that amendment pass, but Democrats won full control of the state legislature for the first time since the election of 1982, while also winning every statewide race. In New Hampshire, where voters were particularly likely to say that abortion was most important in determining their vote, Democrats successfully defended potentially vulnerable Senate and House seats. In New Mexico, where abortion was also a highly ranked issue, Democrats flipped a House seat that was rated as \"likely Republican\" by our forecast, ousting two-term incumbent Rep. Yvette Herrell in New Mexico\u2019s 2nd District. Of course, those polls don\u2019t offer clear answers for everything that happened in the election. The economy dramatically overshadowed abortion as a voting issue for Pennsylvania voters in the Emerson survey, even though abortion access was very much at stake, and Democrats made a strong showing, flipping a Senate seat, winning the governor\u2019s race and possibly claiming a majority in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives for the first time since the Republican wave election in 2010 (the outcome is still unknown). But other polls found that abortion was more important for Pennsylvania voters: A Marist poll in late October/early November found 20 percent of registered voters said it was \u201ctop of mind\u201d (inflation was higher, at 36 percent), and a Fox News survey in late October found that 24 percent of Pennsylvania voters called it the most important issue for their Senate vote, not far behind inflation (33 percent). Overall, there was plenty of data indicating that abortion consistently remained an important issue for some Americans in the months after the Supreme Court decision. And even though most voters were more concerned about inflation, abortion was motivating a significant number of them. In a normal midterm year with an unpopular Democratic president, the possibility that Democrats might maintain the Senate \u2014 and even narrowly lose the House \u2014 might seem outlandish. But the Supreme Court ensured that this would not be a normal year. And despite media skepticism, there were plenty of polls pointing in that direction.",

    "The Midterms Made State Governments Bluer": [
        "By Nathaniel Rakich",
        " Abortion bans, right-to-work laws, voting restrictions \u2014 for years, a lot of the major legislation coming out of state capitols has been conservative. But after Democrats\u2019 clear victory in state-level elections last week, landmark liberal policies could be coming to a state near you.\u00a0\u00a0 For the first time in years, more Americans will live in a state fully controlled by Democrats than in one fully controlled by Republicans.1 Thanks to their wins in gubernatorial or state-legislative elections, Democrats2 took complete control of three new state governments in the 2022 elections: Michigan, Minnesota and Vermont. They broke the GOP monopoly on power in Arizona and, potentially, New Hampshire.3 They also kept full control of state government in four of the five states where they were in danger of losing it. And they prevented Republicans from taking full control of North Carolina, Wisconsin and maybe even Alaska.  Republicans, on the other hand, didn\u2019t flip a single legislative chamber from blue to red. This is the first midterm election since at least 1934 that the president\u2019s party hasn\u2019t lost a state-legislative chamber, according to Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee President Jessica Post. And though it didn\u2019t affect who controlled state government, Democrats flipped the Maryland and Massachusetts governorships and maybe the Pennsylvania state House.4  Democrats\u2019 most significant win was probably Michigan. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was reelected, and Democrats took control of the state House for the first time since 2011 and the state Senate for the first time since 1984. Democrats won the popular vote for the Michigan state House in 2012, 2014, 2018 and 2020 but fell short of a majority each time because of state-legislative maps that favored Republicans.\u00a0 This year, though, Michigan\u2019s new independent redistricting commission drew legislative maps that were pretty fair. In the state Senate, Democrats won the popular vote 50 percent to 49 percent and a 20-18 majority; in the state House, they won the popular vote 51 percent to 49 percent and a 56-54 majority. The new Democratic trifecta could lead to many new progressive policies in Michigan. Democrats say they want to repeal the state law banning union membership as a condition of employment, strengthen laws against LGBT discrimination and repeal the retirement tax. In Minnesota, Democrats kept the governor\u2019s office and state House and flipped the state Senate from red to blue, gaining complete control of state government for the first time since 2013. As a result, Democrats hope to codify abortion rights into state law and legalize marijuana. Minnesota currently has multiple small political parties whose raison d\u2019\u00eatre is marijuana legalization and often siphon votes away from Democrats. With the issue no longer on the table, the parties may fade from existence, giving Democrats a small boost in future elections. And in Vermont, Democrats and Progressives, a liberal third party, now control a supermajority of votes in the state House. They already had a supermajority in the state Senate, so they can now override vetoes from Republican Gov. Phil Scott. Last term, legislation to reduce carbon emissions and ban evictions in Burlington without \u201cjust cause\u201d failed to pass because they didn\u2019t have the votes to override his veto. Democrats didn\u2019t take complete control of state government in Pennsylvania (as expected, they fell short in the state Senate). Still, they set themselves up to do so in 2024 by gaining at least 11 seats in the state House \u2014 which they are on the verge of flipping. As of Nov. 16 at 4 p.m. Eastern, Democrats had won 101 House seats, and Republicans had won 100. Control of the chamber will be determined by the outcomes of the two races that are still too close. Democrats lost total control of just one state government this year. In Nevada, Republican Joe Lombardo defeated Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak in the gubernatorial race. But, notably, Democrats kept their grip on Colorado, Maine, New Mexico and Oregon after winning the governorship and state legislature in each. Though these aren\u2019t new trifectas, none was guaranteed to stay in Democratic hands. Democrats also already enjoyed complete control of the Maryland and Massachusetts governments despite their Republican governors because Democrats had veto-proof majorities in the state legislature. But with the election of Maura Healey in Massachusetts and Wes Moore in Maryland, the executive branch in each state will also be Democratic-controlled. That is still important in terms of agenda-setting and implementing laws. For example, Moore has said he wants to prioritize raising the minimum wage and establishing an optional public-service year for high school graduates. In Colorado and Oregon, too, Democrats will have an easier time governing than before. Colorado Democrats gained so many seats in the state Senate that, according to the Colorado Sun\u2019s Jesse Aaron Paul, they struggled to find enough chairs for them in the committee room where they gathered to pick their caucus\u2019 leaders. And in Oregon, though Republicans gained seats, voters in the state passed a ballot measure that would penalize legislators for walking out of the Legislature to stop legislative business \u2014 a tactic that Republicans have used to block the Democratic agenda. Democrats\u2019 success can also be measured by the Republican policies that will not become law due to the 2022 elections. For example, although Republicans secured a supermajority in the North Carolina state Senate, they came one seat short in the state House. That means the party will remain incapable of overriding Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper\u2019s vetoes. If they had gotten that supermajority, Republicans may have restricted abortions and how race is taught in public schools.\u00a0 It\u2019s a similar situation in Wisconsin. Republicans snagged a supermajority in the state Senate but not in the state Assembly, allowing reelected Democratic Gov. Tony Evers\u2019s vetoes to stand. This will probably prevent Republicans from abolishing the Wisconsin Elections Commission or restructuring it in a partisan way, as they have proposed. And they\u2019re still counting ballots in Alaska. But it looks like the state Senate and state House will be very close \u2014 increasing the odds that bipartisan coalitions will form to govern them. This unique arrangement isn\u2019t unusual for Alaska; a coalition of Democrats, independents and moderate Republicans has controlled the state House for six years. But we likely won\u2019t know who will wield the gavel until the legislative session starts. Those three states already had divided government, but Democrats also ended a Republican trifecta in at least one state: Arizona. Although Republicans appear to have kept control of the state Senate and state House (by one seat each!), Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs was elected governor.\u00a0 Perhaps the most bonkers state-legislative election result of 2022 comes from New Hampshire, where Democrats are just one seat away from breaking the Republican trifecta. Based on preliminary election-night results, it appeared that Republicans had won 203 seats in the Granite State\u2019s massive, 400-member state House. But the results in 28 districts are being recounted. And two recounts have already found that the Democrat was the rightful winner in a race Republicans had been leading, while a third resulted in a tie. As a result, Republicans now lead for only 200 seats and Democrats lead for 199 \u2014 meaning Democrats need only one more recount to go their way to break the GOP majority.5 So the next two years in the New Hampshire state House will likely be chaotic no matter what happens. Party control could even change depending on how many legislators (who, in New Hampshire, work for $100 a year, plus mileage) make it to Concord for a given session. State governments are often called the \u201claboratories of democracy\u201d because they often pass ambitious or innovative policies before the federal government does. But with control of Washington, D.C., now split between Democrats and Republicans after the midterms, they could be the only places where meaningful policies are passed for the next two years.",

    "Why Lauren Boebert's Race Is So Close": [
        "By Kaleigh Rogers",
        " At a local Republican assembly in Grand Junction, Colorado, last March, I watched Rep. Lauren Boebert receive not one, but two standing ovations: One for her unremarkable five-minute speech, the other just for showing up at all. It was a sympathetic audience, but still, among her base, it was clear she was beloved. That \u2014 combined with many indicators, including our own forecast, suggesting the Republican congresswoman would sail into a second term \u2014 was why I was shocked to see the race for her seat representing Colorado\u2019s 3rd District turn into one of the closest elections of the midterms.  Colorado\u2019s 3rd District is red and, thanks to redistricting, has gotten redder since the last time Boebert ran \u2014 it has a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean1 of R+19. As an incumbent Republican in a midterm cycle that looked like it would favor the GOP, Boebert was expected to easily win: Our forecast gave Boebert a 97-in-100 chance of winning. As of 5 p.m. Eastern on Wednesday, Boebert had a slim, 1,122-vote lead over Democrat and former Aspen City Council Member Adam Frisch. But even if she prevails, it\u2019ll be a photo finish in a race that was absolutely not expected to be close. So what the heck happened? While Republicans overall performed poorer than expected this midterm cycle, certain things about this race made it particularly susceptible to a potential upset \u2014 and help explain why Boebert wasn\u2019t popping Champagne on election night. (Boebert\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.) Part of the story here is the fact that Colorado as a whole was hit with a blue wave this election, which washed out even into Boebert\u2019s red district. Not only did Democrats win big-ticket races for governor and Senate, they also won competitive House races in the 7th District and newly created 8th District and flipped seven seats in the state legislature, giving the state GOP the smallest minority it ever had. Republican state Rep. Colin Larson, who lost his seat, called it an \u201cextinction-level event,\u201d according to Colorado Public Radio: \u201cThis was the asteroid that ended the reign of the dinosaur, and in this case, the dinosaur was the Republican Party.\u201d\u00a0 Though the district overall is red, there are blue counties and pockets within it, and enthusiasm for Democratic candidates up and down the ballot may have helped buoy Frisch\u2019s campaign. We saw this effect in other red districts in Colorado, too, like the 3rd: Incumbent Rep. Doug Lamborn, a Republican, won his race by 16 points, 4 points less than in 2020. In the 4th District, Rep. Ken Buck won his election by the same margin (24 points) as in 2020, but that was after redistricting made his district even redder.\u00a0 But the blue wave clearly isn\u2019t enough to explain such a razor-thin margin in Boebert\u2019s race. She also had some weaknesses that were exploited by a surprisingly strong Democratic candidate. Like the rest of the state, a plurality of voters in the 3rd District \u2014 40 percent \u2014 are unaffiliated, according to an analysis by the Colorado Independent Redistricting Commissions. Some of those voters still reliably vote for one party or the other, but a portion are swing voters or moderates who don\u2019t find candidates too far down either end of the political spectrum appealing. After the 2020 election, we noted that Boebert\u2019s district didn\u2019t look like the districts where some of the other more hardline Republicans won: It\u2019s less white, less evangelical Christian and less Republican. This may be why Boebert won with just 51 percent of the vote in 2020 (and why former President Donald Trump carried it by just 5.5 points). Even though the 3rd District has a solid Republican lean, it has been represented by a Democrat as recently as the early 2010s (Democrat John Salazar served 2005-2011), and the last two elections point to some fissures in the Republican stronghold.\u00a0 Boebert\u2019s modest win in 2020 is what inspired her challenger, Frisch, to run, he told FiveThirtyEight: \u201cI started to think, \u2018If 5 percent of the people had switched their vote in 2020, Boebert would have lost.\u2019\u201d He says he figured he would need to carve away closer to 10 percent of voters to have a shot, given the redistricting changes, but that was a margin he felt confident he could sway. \u201cIt was never supposed to be a kamikaze suicide mission,\u201d Frisch said.\u00a0 Throughout the campaign, Frisch billed himself as a moderate, \u201cconservative businessman\u201d who would get things done, in an effort to sway more centrist Republicans who were disenchanted with Boebert\u2019s headline-grabbing stunts. Though Boebert has her fans, she is a polarizing figure, said Zack Roday, the campaign manager for Joe O\u2019Dea, the Republican candidate for Senate in Colorado. \u201cA lot of people like her, and a lot of people don\u2019t,\u201d Roday said. \u201cThere are a lot of strong opinions about her, and certainly she is seen as a Trump-like figure, and so obviously she\u2019s connected to that brand, for better or for worse.\u201d That includes critics within her party like state Sen. Don Coram, who challenged Boebert in the primary and ended up endorsing Frisch in the general election. Boebert also doesn\u2019t have a strong track record from her first term in Congress. She sponsored a few dozen bills, most of which were stunts and none of which gained any traction.\u00a0 The dollars around this race help fill in some of the blanks as well. Frisch and Boebert\u2019s campaigns were pretty evenly funded, with her campaign raising $6.7 million to his $5.2 million, thanks in no small part to Frisch\u2019s own pocketbook: As a millionaire former currency trader, he bankrolled his own campaign to the tune of $2.2 million. Where the funds diverged was in outside spending. In 2020, outside spending against both Boebert and her opponent was fairly even. But this year, over half a million dollars was spent to oppose Boebert, while none was spent opposing Frisch, according to data from OpenSecrets.\u00a0 All of this points to one last potential factor: This race may have been overlooked, particularly by pollsters and Republicans who saw Boebert as a shoo-in. Aside from three partisan polls (two of which were sponsored by Frisch\u2019s campaign), pollsters ignored this race. And despite Boebert being a diehard Trump loyalist, the former president never came out to Colorado to campaign for her as he did for candidates in other races, according to Kevin McCarney, the chair of the GOP in Mesa County, the second-most populous county in the 3rd District. \u201cHe really wasn\u2019t vocal about Lauren at all. It could have been complacency, that they just thought she was going to win, but it\u2019s a little disappointing,\u201d McCarney said. Frisch\u2019s centrist platform and his ability to self fund prodigiously seem to have helped him exploit Boebert\u2019s weaknesses in a district that has a not-inconsequential contingent of moderate voters who were turned off by the congresswoman\u2019s extremism. Regardless of the result, this race has shown that the Colorado Western Slope can be competitive, given the right \u2014 or wrong \u2014 candidates, and neither party is likely to overlook it in 2024.\u00a0",

    "Republicans Won The House \u2014 Barely": [
        "By Nathaniel Rakich",
        " As expected, Republicans have taken control of the U.S. House of Representatives, ending two years of Democratic rule in Washington, D.C. But what wasn\u2019t expected was how narrow the Republicans\u2019 majority would be. As of Wednesday evening, ABC News estimates that Republicans have won at least 218 seats and Democrats have won at least 210.  Seven districts remain undecided: four where Democrats currently lead and three where Republicans do. If those leads all hold (which seems likely), Republicans will go into the 118th Congress with a 221-to-214 majority.\u00a0 FiveThirtyEight\u2019s final preelection Deluxe forecast expected that, on average, Republicans would win 230 House seats and Democrats would win 205. So Democrats did a bit better than we reckoned, although 221 seats for the GOP was still among the most likely outcomes. And interestingly, Democrats didn\u2019t do that just by winning all the close races; they made some strikes deep into GOP territory. For example, Democrats won at least seven of the 13 districts rated as \u201ctoss-ups\u201d by FiveThirtyEight\u2019s final forecast, while Republicans won at least five. But Democrats also won five of the 16 districts that our forecast rated as \u201clikely Republican.\u201d This includes Colorado\u2019s 8th District, where Democratic state Rep. Yadira Caraveo won despite having only a 9-in-100 chance in our forecast. Democrats even won one district that our forecast had rated as \u201csolid Republican.\u201d In Washington\u2019s 3rd District, business owner Marie Gluesenkamp Perez had just a 2-in-100 chance of winning, according to our forecast. However, she defeated veteran Joe Kent 50 percent to 49 percent. This was likely because Kent was an extremely weak candidate: He has a history of working and associating with white nationalists and defeated a more moderate Republican in the primary.\u00a0 Republicans didn\u2019t score as many upsets, but they had their fair share, too. They won two \u201clean Democratic\u201d districts and one \u201clikely Democratic\u201d district. Notably, all three GOP-flipped districts were in New York, one of the brightest spots for Republicans nationally this election.1 Indeed, one of the hallmarks of this midterm was how various states experienced it differently. It was a good election for Republicans in states like New York, but a bad one for Republicans in states like Ohio, where Democrats scored two House upsets.\u00a0 So how should we assess the House results for Republicans? On the one hand, Republicans took control of the chamber and ended Democrats\u2019 ability to pass legislation without GOP approval. That\u2019s a big deal! On the other hand, though, Republicans have to be pretty disappointed with their showing. They will likely gain around eight seats, which is relatively low by historical standards. Since the end of World War II, the president\u2019s party has lost an average of 26 House seats in midterm elections.2 Of course, Republicans had an unexpectedly good 2020 election in the House, so they were starting from a higher baseline (you can\u2019t flip a seat that you already control). But even their raw seat total is underwhelming by the standards of recent midterms. Republicans controlled 242 seats after the 2010 midterms and 247 after 2014; Democrats held 233 after the 2006 midterms and 235 after 2018. More importantly, it will likely be a difficult feat for House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy to muster up 218 votes to pass anything \u2014 or even be elected speaker. While a GOP House would mostly be playing defense (killing Democratic bills, conducting investigations into the Biden administration) rather than offense (passing its own bills), it would still need to pass bipartisan legislation like the budget. And conservative hardliners made it difficult for Republicans to govern even when they had wider majorities in 2015-2016 and 2017-2018. So we could be in for a chaotic two years in the south wing of the Capitol and look back at the 2022 elections as a Republican victory in name only.",

    "A Historic Number Of Women Will Be Governors Next Year": [
        "By Meredith Conroy and Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux",
        " After two record-shattering elections for women in Congress, it was female governors\u2019 turn this year. Nearly 25 percent of the nation\u2019s governors will be women in 2023, including in several states that have never before elected a woman to their top office. It\u2019s a significant milestone, given that governors\u2019 seats have been especially difficult for women to win but are some of the most important and prestigious offices in American politics \u2014 particularly for politicians with their eye on the presidency.\u00a0 Women running for Congress also defied the odds. There will be at least 145 women in Congress this year, and up to 149 after all the votes are counted.1 Anything north of 147 would mean there are more congresswomen next term than there were in this one.  That number is especially impressive considering that the parties nominated fewer women than in 2020, and that many female incumbents looked like they could lose their races. Several women unexpectedly flipped seats, which helped make up for the handful of female incumbents who lost and won\u2019t be returning to Congress next year.  In January 2023, 12 women will be in governor\u2019s mansions. That might not seem like a lot \u2014 but it\u2019s a big record. Up until now, there have been only 45 women governors total, and at most, only nine have served simultaneously. Several states elected female governors for the first time this year \u2014 like Arkansas, Massachusetts and New York.2 Incumbent governors won reelection in Alabama, South Dakota, Iowa, Michigan, New Mexico, Maine and Kansas. And two Democrats \u2014 Tina Kotek in Oregon and Katie Hobbs in Arizona \u2014 won in close races against other women.  For years, women\u2019s representation in governor\u2019s mansions has lagged behind other branches of government. Currently, women are only 18 percent of governors nationwide, while they hold just under 30 percent of seats in Congress and just over 30 percent of seats in state legislatures. It\u2019s especially difficult for would-be governors to set themselves up for the role because there simply aren\u2019t as many spots to fill \u2014 there are only 50 governors, which creates a limited number of opportunities to run. But historically, women have also been more likely to face barriers when running for executive-level offices like governor or president. Political science studies have found that voters are less comfortable electing women to serve as solo decision-makers, rather than a group of lawmakers. That may be changing. A recent study found that Democratic voters, in particular, are less likely to be resistant to the idea of a woman president than they were in the past. And the overall uptick in women who have successfully run for office over the past few election cycles may be normalizing the idea of women serving in all kinds of elected leadership, and creating a stronger pipeline of women to run for prestigious offices like governor. In that sense, this year\u2019s election result could be seen as the natural result of the wave of women who were elected to lower-level offices like state legislature in 2018 and 2020, creating more experienced candidates to run for higher offices and getting voters used to the idea that women can win, even in competitive races. Of course, there are limitations to this year\u2019s progress. Nearly all of the women who were elected governor this year are white, with the sole exception of New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, who was elected to a second term. And more Democrats than Republicans won: There will be at least eight female Democratic governors, and four Republican women governors. But overall, this year\u2019s governor\u2019s results are a significant milestone for women candidates and could even set up some women for a presidential bid in 2024.\u00a0 The previous midterm election, in 2018, was known as a \u201cblue wave,\u201d and Democratic women played a large part in making that happen. In the 116th session of Congress, which followed that election, they held a historic number of congressional seats (105, up from the previous high of 81 in the 115th Congress) and were also responsible for more than 60 percent of the seats their party flipped.3 In the current session of Congress, the 117th, 107 Democratic women are serving, while the GOP had its own \u201cYear of the Woman\u201d in the 2020 election and now has 40 Republican women serving, up from their previous high of 30 in the 109th Congress. With those gains, women now make up 27 percent of Congress. That\u2019s about what the percentage will be when the new Congress starts in January, too, if not a little higher after all the races are called.\u00a0 This cycle, women candidates were not set up for another banner year. Democrats and Republicans nominated fewer women to Congress than in 2020, and a number of female incumbents were vulnerable. Democratic women who flipped their seats in 2018 were especially likely to be facing strong challengers this year \u2014\u00a0 for instance, Reps. Elaine Luria in Virginia\u2019s 2nd District, Cindy Axne in Iowa\u2019s 3rd District and Susan Wild in Pennsylvania\u2019s 7th District.\u00a0 Despite this year\u2019s hurdles, women incumbents did surprisingly well. Not all of them won \u2014 for instance, Luria and Axne both lost \u2014 but Wild defeated her challenger, and other women in toss-ups prevailed, like Democrat Hillary Scholten in Michigan\u2019s 3rd District. Meanwhile, some women flipped long-shot seats: Take Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, who won the race for Washington\u2019s 3rd District despite having only a 2-in-100 chance of winning in our final Deluxe forecast.\u00a0 As a result, there could be as many as two more women in the next Congress than in the current Congress \u2014 although that depends on what happens in the remaining uncalled races. Regardless of the outcome in those races, though, the number of women of color in Congress will also increase from 49 to at least 55, thanks in part to victories from women of color like Democrat Yadira Caraveo in Colorado\u2019s 8th District, Republican Lori Chavez-DeRemer in Oregon\u2019s 5th District and Democrat Emilia Sykes in Ohio\u2019s 13th District.4 And as was previously the case, most women in Congress will be Democrats.  Some vulnerable female candidates \u2014 like Luria \u2014 were running against other women, so those losses didn\u2019t result in a decline in women\u2019s representation. According to the Center for American Women and Politics, there were 42 congressional races with two female major-party nominees. That\u2019s not a record \u2014 in 2020, according to CAWP, there were 51 congressional races with only female major-party nominees \u2014 but it\u2019s much higher than in previous cycles, suggesting that women running against each other could get more common, which would help buffer women in Congress from sharp declines in the future.\u00a0 At this point, it\u2019s not clear whether this year\u2019s results are a sign that women in Congress will face slower progress going forward. Kelly Dittmar, an associate professor of political science at Rutgers University-Camden and the director of research at the Center for American Women and Politics, told us before the election that it\u2019s probably not reasonable to expect dramatic increases for women\u2019s representation every two years. Women\u2019s ability to gain new seats depends, in part, on whether male incumbents choose to retire, leaving their seats open. And as more women win competitive districts, they have a greater likelihood of losing their seats. But Dittmar said it\u2019s also possible that both parties stopped working as hard to nominate and elevate women after two consecutive cycles where women made significant gains, thinking that the parties\u2019 work is done. That may have contributed to the dip in female nominees this cycle, which meant that women candidates had to overperform to make gains in Congress. So women\u2019s success in future elections may partially depend on whether the parties refocus on helping women run and win. Overall, women are still very far from gender parity in Congress or statewide office. But the fact that this year, despite its many headwinds, didn\u2019t result in a wipeout for female candidates is significant. There\u2019s substantial research showing that while women from different parties may not see eye to eye about policy priorities \u2014 or even what it means to be a woman in government \u2014 women do tend to prioritize issues related to women and families after they are elected. That could mean a greater voice for women generally \u2014 although probably not more bipartisan consensus.",

    "Why DeSantis Is A Major Threat To Trump\u2019s Reelection": [
        "By Nate Silver",
        " The case for Donald Trump as the front-runner for the 2024 Republican nomination is incredibly obvious. As my colleague Nathaniel Rakich pointed out after the former president announced his reelection bid, Trump has extremely strong favorability ratings among Republican voters. He\u2019s remade the GOP in his image. And predictions of his demise have a notoriously poor track record: I was one of those people who was far too skeptical of his chances for the 2016 Republican nomination for far too long. And yet, since the midterm elections, something seems to have shifted. People putting money on the line have moved away from Trump in the last week. He now has only a 35 percent chance of winning the 2024 nomination according to prediction markets, down from what it was before Election Day, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is up to 40 percent (though DeSantis has slightly fallen and Trump has risen immediately after Trump\u2019s announcement to run for president).  If I were allowed to bet on politics, I might buy some Trump stock at that price: These prediction markets aren\u2019t always so wise (they did comparatively poorly in the midterms, for instance), and it\u2019s hard to imagine that, given all the influence he still has over Republicans, Trump\u2019s chances are less than 1 in 3. But I think there\u2019s a pretty solid case to be made for Trump and DeSantis as co-favorites. As Rakich points out, Trump has led in the vast majority of polls of Republican voters since the 2020 election. Believe it or not, these early polls do have some predictive power.\u00a0 However, polls since last week\u2019s midterm show a shift in the race. For example, a YouGov poll released last week found DeSantis leading Trump among Republicans, with 42 percent to Trump\u2019s 35 percent. And a poll by the Canadian firm Leger had DeSantis ahead 45-43 among Republicans, although it had a tiny sample size. By contrast, a Morning Consult poll from this week found Trump still ahead among potential Republican primary voters, 47-33, although that reflects a gain for DeSantis; two preelection Morning Consult polls found Trump ahead 48-26 and 49-24. A series of post-midterm polls sponsored by Republican-aligned groups have found DeSantis ahead in early primary states. I am a wee bit skeptical of these partisan polls because people who prefer DeSantis may be trying to spin a \u201cDeSantis has momentum!\u201d narrative. But as I said, DeSantis has also looked pretty good in nonpartisan polls since the midterms. Perhaps it\u2019s a short-term bounce, but it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if the midterms are an inflection point or a wake-up call for Republican voters given all the incorrect predictions of a \u201cred wave.\u201d\u00a0 And here\u2019s something else: The study of early primary polls that I referred to earlier found that the polls have more predictive power if you adjust them for name recognition. DeSantis\u2019s name recognition is high, but not universal like Trump\u2019s. For example, a Quinnipiac University poll from July found that 35 percent of voters hadn\u2019t heard enough about DeSantis to form an opinion about him. So I don\u2019t know how much longer \u201cjust trust the polls\u201d will be an argument in Trump\u2019s favor. They may go through some wild swings in response to the midterms and Trump\u2019s 2024 announcement. But given Trump\u2019s much wider name recognition, having DeSantis polling fairly close to Trump \u2014 or even ahead in some surveys \u2014 does not strike me as particularly good news for Trump. I\u2019ll probably publish about a million stories between now and the first primaries about how much the views of Republican \u201cparty elites\u201d matter. By that phrase, which is borrowed from the book \u201cThe Party Decides,\u201d I refer to influential Republicans and conservatives ranging from elected officials to talk-show hosts. It\u2019s important to clarify that by \u201cparty elite,\u201d I\u2019m not necessarily referring to some fuddy-duddy senator who was first elected to office 40 years ago, but rather the broader universe of Republicans and conservatives that GOP primary voters might find trustworthy. Some media figures who were pro-Trump and anti-establishment in 2016 have begun to express reservations about Trump. In 2016, of course, Trump famously bucked the wishes of the Republican \u201cestablishment\u201d and undermined \u201cThe Party Decides\u201d view of the race on his way to the nomination. But I think people should be a bit careful about overgeneralizing from that election. In 2016, the party never coalesced around an alternative to Trump; this year, they potentially have one in DeSantis. And every nomination contest has its own dynamic. As bad as \u201cThe Party Decides\u201d looked in both the Republican and Democratic primaries in 2016 (given Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019s vigorous challenge to Hillary Clinton despite virtually zero party elite support) it did great in 2020, when Jim Clyburn and other party elites flocked to Joe Biden right around the South Carolina primary, and Biden rapidly won the nomination after having lost the first three contests. This time, Trump will not have the element of surprise that he and Sanders did in 2016. From the standpoint of demonstrating the ability to win elections, the midterms couldn\u2019t have gone any better for DeSantis. He won Florida by 19 points; the state has swung so far right during DeSantis\u2019s time in office that it can no longer really be considered a swing state. By contrast, Trump-endorsed candidates like Mehmet Oz, Don Bolduc, Blake Masters lost key Senate races, while Herschel Walker has his work cut out for him in the Georgia runoff. The gap in candidate quality was plausibly responsible for costing Republicans control of the Senate. The rebuttal I usually hear to this is that Republican voters must not care about electability since they nominated Trump in 2016. But polls of Republican voters throughout 2015 and 2016 consistently found they did see Trump as electable; in fact, they thought of him as the most electable candidate. What\u2019s going through the head of a typical Republican voter these days is hard to say. In the modern primary era,1 no previous general election loser has sought a party nomination.2 A party generally wants to move on from its losing candidates; it\u2019s not like there were a ton of Democrats clamoring for Hillary Clinton to run again in 2020, for instance. But of course, GOP voters may not think of Trump as a loser given that a majority of Republicans believe Trump\u2019s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. This all starts to get pretty weird: If you\u2019re a Republican who does think the election was stolen, you still have to wrestle with the fact that Biden is president while DeSantis is beginning his second term in the Florida Governor\u2019s Mansion. We could go into more detail \u2014 it certainly won\u2019t hurt DeSantis that Florida has a winner-take-all primary, for instance \u2014 but there will be plenty of time for that later. For now, both DeSantis and Trump look like extremely plausible nominees, and anyone else is a distant third.",

    "Why Trump Is Favored To Win The 2024 Republican Presidential Primary": [
        "By Nathaniel Rakich",
        " We don\u2019t even know every result of 2022 yet, but the 2024 election has already begun. On Tuesday, former President Donald Trump announced that he would seek a second nonconsecutive term as president. While it\u2019s too early to predict Trump\u2019s chances of going all the way, the former president is the current favorite to win the Republican primary again. But nothing is assured. First, Trump remains popular and influential among Republican voters. According to Civiqs, 80 percent of registered Republican voters have a favorable view of the former president, and only 11 percent have an unfavorable view. Admittedly, he is a little less popular than on Election Day 2020 when 91 percent viewed him favorably. But the decline has been gradual.  Republican voters also demonstrated their loyalty to Trump \u2014 or at least his vision for the party \u2014 when they nominated 82 percent of the nonincumbents he endorsed in contested Republican primaries for Senate, House and governor.\u00a0 Granted, that isn\u2019t as impressive as it seems. Several times, Trump endorsed candidates who were already well on their way to winning. And Trump\u2019s endorsees did fail to win certain highly watched contests, like the primary for Georgia governor. But just as often, Trump\u2019s endorsement seemed to give a meaningful polling boost to its recipient. For example, Ohio Senate candidate and author J.D. Vance went from trailing in the polls before Trump\u2019s endorsement to leading in almost every survey afterward.\u00a0 Trump also leads early polling of the Republican primary by a substantial margin. In most national surveys, he registers in the high 40s or low 50s, 20-30 points ahead of his closest competitor, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. (Though DeSantis is polling higher than he did earlier in the year.)  Finally, Trump leads in polls of early primary states, albeit generally by smaller margins. A poll of Iowa conducted by a pro-DeSantis group over the summer showed Trump leading DeSantis 38 percent to 17 percent. In August, a poll of New Hampshire conducted by Saint Anselm College put Trump up 50 percent to 29 percent. And most recently, Susquehanna Polling & Research found Trump at 41 percent and DeSantis at 34 percent in Nevada in late October.1 Obviously, we\u2019re still more than a year away from anyone casting their votes, so those numbers could change. But an analysis by my colleague Geoffrey Skelley in 2019 found that national primary polls in the first half of the year before the election are pretty predictive of who will win the nomination. Historically, from 1972 to 2016, candidates with high name recognition who polled in the 40s and 50s nationally won the nomination more than 75 percent of the time.  But of course, 75 percent isn\u2019t 100 percent, and we\u2019re dealing with a small sample size here. In past presidential primaries, four candidates have polled, on average, between 40 and 60 percent in national polls in the first half of the year before the election. And three of them won their party\u2019s nomination: then-Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole in 1996, then-Vice President Al Gore in 2000 and then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush in 2000. All three had feisty challengers \u2014 Dole and Bush each lost a handful of states \u2014 but they won easily in the end. It\u2019s not too hard to imagine Trump following that same path in 2024. On the other hand, then-Sen. Ted Kennedy lost the 1980 Democratic primary despite polling at an average of 47 percent in the first half of 1979. But he was also in a unique situation: He was primarying a sitting president, Jimmy Carter, who wasn\u2019t that far behind him at 32 percent. Carter, of course, recovered to win the nomination that year. Still, Kennedy shows that Trump\u2019s nomination isn\u2019t inevitable.\u00a0 One crucial factor will be how many candidates run against Trump. Too many could divide the anti-Trump vote, making it easier for him to win. For example, in an October poll from YouGov/the Claremont McKenna College Rose Institute of State and Local Government, Trump led DeSantis 55 percent to 45 percent when the two were matched up head to head. But when other candidates (e.g., former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott) were included as options, Trump led DeSantis 55 percent to 33 percent. Several potential 2024 contenders, including former Vice President Mike Pence and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, have indicated that they may run regardless of what Trump does. So this scenario may come to pass. But even if they do run, they may not make it to the primaries, so the race may narrow to a head-to-head between Trump and DeSantis (or another candidate) regardless. This is one of the more significant sources of uncertainty for the 2024 GOP primary \u2014 will DeSantis (or another candidate) emerge from 2023\u2019s \u201cinvisible primary\u201d as the dominant non-Trump candidate, or will the field still be muddled? Another source of uncertainty is the many ongoing investigations against Trump. True, Republicans so far have shown little concern over them, but if he is indicted, all bets are off the table, considering that that situation would be unprecedented. It\u2019s plausible that an indictment could affect Republican voters\u2019 perceptions of Trump\u2019s electability in a general election. When Trump announced his first presidential bid in 2015, we hadn\u2019t seen a candidate quite like him, and his candidacy was difficult to handicap. Even though he began that campaign very unpopular among Republican voters and bitterly opposed by the GOP establishment, predictions of his political demise proved very wrong. Seven years later, Trump is still a unique political figure: A former president hasn\u2019t sought a nonconsecutive second term or faced criminal investigation in generations, and Trump is doing both. This time, he starts the campaign as the front-runner, not the underdog. Still, the lesson is the same: Don\u2019t be overconfident in your predictions. With Donald Trump, anything can happen.

    "Turnout Was High Again. Is This The New Normal?": [
        "By Monica Potts",
        " Is the United States in an era of high turnout? Turnout surged during the last midterm elections in 2018 when 49 percent of eligible voters cast a ballot for the highest office in their state, according to data analyzed by the U.S. Elections Project, an election data website maintained by Michael P. McDonald, a political science professor at the University of Florida. The Census Bureau, using a slightly different measure, reported that it was the highest recorded turnout for a midterm election since the bureau began keeping records in 1978. Early signs point to a similar level of turnout in last week\u2019s midterms. Using preliminary estimates from state elections officials around the country,1 the U.S. Elections Project estimates a turnout rate of 47 percent for this year\u2019s elections. In 14 states, turnout even went slightly up compared to 2018. (The estimates could change in states where the ballot counting is not yet complete.)  While most state turnout estimates dipped a little compared to 2018 figures, they\u2019re still higher than in previous recent midterm years, and turnout in 2020 was elevated compared to past presidential elections. So what\u2019s going on? Well, probably not just one thing! Instead, there are a bunch of different forces that could have brought people out to vote in the past few elections. In 2018, according to an analysis by The Brookings Institution, Democratic-leaning groups \u2014 young voters, minorities and white college graduates \u2014 saw the biggest increases in turnout. That makes sense, since a Republican president was in office, and those demographics make up a big part of the modern Democratic coalition. President Donald Trump also motivated Republican-leaning groups to turn out that year, although they saw smaller increases. In advance of the 2018 midterms, a Pew Research Center survey found that voter enthusiasm was extremely high and that 60 percent of voters viewed their vote as an expression of support for or against Trump. Dislike of the other party, what researchers call \u201cnegative partisanship,\u201d has motivated voters in recent elections and may still be increasing.  Turnout was also extremely high in the 2020 presidential election, which Trump lost to President Biden. Nearly two-thirds of eligible voters went to the polls, up 7 points from 2016, and Pew Research Center reported voter increases in every state. With Trump running for re-election, voters on both sides showed up, and because of the COVID-19 pandemic, many states worked to make voting more accessible, making it easier to request absentee ballots and vote by mail, among other changes (at least temporarily). Of course, a big difference between 2018 and 2022 is that Trump was not on the ballot this year. But Trump-ism was still in the mix, and still could have motivated voters. Sixty percent of Americans had a candidate on their ballots who denied that Biden won the 2020 election, and in some states, those election deniers ran for key offices that would have given them power over election administration in their states. Enabled by Trump\u2019s appointments, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade this summer, leading some states to enact draconian and unpopular bans, while voters elsewhere were moved to defeat initiatives that would have done the same in their own states. Trump endorsed candidates up and down ballots across the country. There isn\u2019t a consistent pattern in the states that saw slight increases in voter turnout compared to 2018. Sure, some states, like Michigan and Pennsylvania, were voting on abortion rights in one way or another, but so were Kentucky and California, and turnout wasn\u2019t up in those states. A state didn\u2019t necessarily need a competitive race to up turnout, either. Yes, Michigan and Pennsylvania had increases and high-stakes races, but so did Arkansas, where the top election was an uncompetitive governor\u2019s race. Perhaps, then, it\u2019s just getting easier to vote. Some states, like Maine and New York, have lowered voting barriers since 2018, retaining universal mail-in ballots or no-excuse absentee voting measures that went into place during the 2020 pandemic, and some of those states seem to have had an increase in turnout. But that wasn\u2019t true in other states: In Massachusetts, pandemic-era expansions of voting rights were made permanent and there was also a gubernatorial race, but turnout appears to have decreased.\u00a0 More than any of these factors, the unifying theme of the past few years has been an increased level of partisan polarization. Voters aren\u2019t just motivated to vote against the other side, they dislike and distrust it. Overall, though, Americans turn out to vote far less than in many similar countries. What the near future holds is a question of laws, stakes and also, to some extent, our political culture.\u00a0",

        " Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell won praise from other Republican senators on Wednesday after a vocal minority in his party harshly criticized some of his leadership decisions and garnered 10 votes to oust him from his post. \"The reality is there's overwhelming support for Mitch McConnell and his leadership,\" Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said after the vote. \"He's been highly successful in the last two years, not to mention the last decades. And believe he's in the best position to lead us into the future.\" \"I think it validates the leader in a really big way,\" Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said \"Who among us wouldn't like to get, you know, 80% of the vote?\" \"I think it's strong,\" Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., said of McConnell's standing in the GOP conference. MCCONNELL WINS SENATE LEADERSHIP ELECTION, OVERCOMES SCOTT CHALLENGE McConnell defeated a challenge from Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., for Senate GOP leader by a tally of 37-10, and one senator voted \"present.\" That victory came even after former President Trump repeatedly called for the man he nicknamed \"Old Crow\" \u2013 which McConnell's embraced \u2013 to be ousted as GOP leader. \"I'm not going anywhere,\" McConnell said when asked if he would consider stepping aside after breaking the record of longest-serving party leader in Senate history, held by late Sen. Mike Mansfield, D-Mont. Scott, who has been at odds with McConnell politically for most of this year, announced his candidacy at the Senate GOP lunch on Tuesday. Scott framed himself as the candidate of change who wanted the GOP to be more aggressive in pushing a conservative agenda for voters. \"If you simply want to stick with the status quo, don\u2019t vote for me,\" he said in a letter to senators. REPUBLICANS EXPRESS CONFIDENCE IN HOUSE LEADERSHIP GOING INTO NEXT CONGRESS: \u2018I LIKE OUR LEADERSHIP\u2019 Scott also pressed to delay the leadership election until after the Dec. 6 Georgia runoff, but senators voted to keep the elections Wednesday as scheduled. \"Although the results of today\u2019s elections weren\u2019t what we hoped for, this is far from the end of our fight to Make Washington Work,\" Scott said in a statement. \"My resolve to stand up for what Republicans across this nation stand for has never been stronger than it is today.\" Some of Scott's allies said his run, though unsuccessful, gave them an optimistic outlook for the future of the party. The debate between the two and the fact that over 20% of members voted against the leader, they said, might force McConnell to make some changes. \"I told Leader McConnell this has been the healthiest enterprise since I've been here in terms of caucus discussion,\" Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., said. \"And Rick, in my mind, brought it out to where we made it a discussion.\" MITCH MCCONNELL ON TRACK TO BECOME LONGEST-SERVING LEADER IN SENATE HISTORY Braun added, \"I think he's going to probably make sure that 50 members, depending on where we're at, all of us feel like we're part of the process. And I think that's healthy.\" SEN. RICK SCOTT LOSES TO MITCH MCCONNELL IN GOP SENATE LEADERSHIP BID \"I think our discussion was very valuable in terms of how we're going to proceed [in the next Congress],\" Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., who also backed Scott, said. \"I think it will be a more collaborative process.\" Others were more suspicious. \"To me, anyway, it wasn't about him,\" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said of McConnell. \"It was about the direction of the conference, how we run campaigns \u2026 and also sort of a legislative approach moving forward. And I think leadership elections are the best opportunity for us to initiate those conversations. So, I wanted to delay.

McCarthy, R-Calif., is facing a challenge to become speaker from Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., and the Freedom Caucus. The current minority leader beat Biggs in a closed-door GOP vote 188-31 on Wednesday. To become speaker, McCarthy will need at least 218 votes if the entire 435-member House is seated and voting. Ryan, who served as speaker from 2015-2019, said McCarthy will win in January. \"I think he's going to win. I think Kevin's the right man for the job. I think everybody knows it,\" Ryan told Fox News Digital. \"And I have every reason to expect that he will become speaker of the House.\" MCCARTHY WINS GOP NOMINATION FOR HOUSE SPEAKER When asked whether Trump's re-election pitch to voters was compelling, Ryan simply said, \"No.\" Trump announced he will run for president in 2024 on Tuesday evening from his Mar-a-Lago, Florida, home. \"No, because I think the evidence is really clear. With Trump we lose, with somebody else we're going to win. We lost the House in \u201818. We lost the presidency and the Senate in \u201920. We didn't get the Senate [in the midterms], and we got a small majority in the House, largely because of Trump,\" he explained. \"There are other factors, but I think the main takeaway here is the evidence is crystal clear. Trump is costing us elections, and we know that there's a great generation of capable conservatives who are more capable of winning the general election than Donald Trump. And I think one of those people will be our nominee and probably win the White House,\" Ryan told Fox News Digital. The former speaker also said Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is emerging as a 2024 GOP presidential candidate front-runner.

        " Republicans have secured a majority in the House of Representatives when the 118th U.S. Congress convenes next January.\u00a0 The GOP has now won 218 seats after The Associated Press projected that Republican Mike Garcia will win re-election in California's 27th Congressional District. Democrats, meanwhile, have secured 209 seats as vote counting continues more than a week after Election Day. Eight seats are still in play.\u00a0 FOX NEWS MIDTERM ELECTIONS RESULTS President Biden congratulated Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., for his party's victory. \u00a0 \"In this election, voters spoke clearly about their concerns: the need to lower costs, protect the right to choose, and preserve our democracy,\" Biden said in a statement. \"I will work with anyone \u2014 Republican or Democrat \u2014 willing to work with me to deliver results for them.\" While Republicans will have control over the House, their slim majority falls short of the \"red tsunami\" that many pundits predicted.\u00a0 Democrats have held the House since winning a majority in the 2018 midterm elections. While Republicans gained ground in the 2020 elections, Democrats maintained a slim majority in single digits for the first two years of President Biden's term in the White House. In their efforts to win back the House, Republicans focused the party's campaign messaging around what voters saw as the issues most important to them, particularly rising crime and the flailing economy. WHAT TO EXPECT FROM REPUBLICANS IF THEY REGAIN THE HOUSE Democrats largely zeroed in on the issue of abortion following the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade over the summer, as well as what the party described as \"threats to democracy,\" despite voters largely rating those issues as less important. House Republicans held leadership elections on Tuesday, with Minority Leader McCarthy fending off a challenge from more conservative elements of the House Republican Conference. The final vote tally was 188-31, though McCarthy will need 218 votes to become speaker in January.\u00a0 The GOP has pledged to use control of the House to launch various investigations, including into Hunter Biden's business dealings, the findings of the Jan. 6 Committee and the Biden administration's largely criticized withdrawal from Afghanistan.\u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The new Congress will officially be sworn into office on Jan. 3.\u00a0",

In an interview with Fox News Digital following a Wednesday campaign stop on his \"Evict Warnock Bus Tour,\" Walker stressed that immediate action was required to alleviate the numerous problems facing American families, including high gas prices, grocery prices and the sour economy in general. \"The focus of it should be back on the people. We should take care of the people that have voted us into office. That's what you should have did right now.

These are things that they need to know. He's a sitting senator. He hasn't represented Georgia since he went to Washington, but I will,\" he added.

Judge Todd Edelman was nominated by President Biden in September to serve on the U.S. District Court of Washington, D.C. Edelman currently sits on the district's Superior Court, where he presided over a case involving Christian Wingfield, who was awaiting a trial for illegal possession of a firearm. Edelman released Wingfield with a GPS monitoring ankle bracelet.

And you know that he had been identified, as the person who, on another occasion, had been shooting a gun in the street at 1 p.m. in broad daylight.\" Blackburn added that a week prior to Edelman\u2019s decision to release Wingfield, another judge denied Wingfield\u2019s request for pre-trial release because he posed a \"safety risk\" to the community.

        " Republicans are looking to hang on to keep a 50-50 split in the Senate with the upcoming Georgia run-off election between Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., and Herschel Walker, with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp joining the effort alongside others including former President Trump. Kemp is expected to join Walker on the campaign trail this weekend in Cobb County, after distancing himself from the Senate race while he focused on his own re-election effort.\u00a0 \"Herschel requested all the help we could get from the governor. The governor said I\u2019m there for you,\" Walker campaign manager Scott Paradise said. Kemp's decision to actively back Walker has him on the same team as Trump, who famously criticized the governor for not helping him overturn the state's results in the 2020 election that had the Peach State for President Biden. FIRST ON FOX: HERSCHEL WALKER HAULS IN $11 MILLION IN GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFF\u00a0 Trump praised Walker as \"a fabulous human being\" after announcing his own campaign for president. The former president's big to take office again has been a source of division among Republicans. Even some GOP lawmakers traditionally supportive of Trump hoped he would delay an announcement until after the Georgia runoff, fearing his rhetoric could divide Republicans and drag down Walker in the process. During the 2022 primaries, the majority of Trump-endorsed candidates were victorious, but many of his most important endorsements struggled and lost in the general elections. While Republicans barely secured enough wins to retake control of the House, they did not enjoy what was expected to be a \"red wave\" in the midterms.\u00a0 Kemp, meanwhile, was one of the party's bright spots as he easily defeated Democratic challenger Stacey Abrams in a high-profile race. The governor garnered 200,000 more votes than Walker from the same voting population \u2013 well above the margin that separated Walker and Warnock. FIRST ON FOX NEW: RNC SENDING TROOPS TO GEORGIA FOR RUNOFF CAMPAIGN Walker's camp is happy to have all the support they can get from their party. \"Everybody realizes that regardless of any disagreements that do or don\u2019t exist, everybody needs to focus on one thing: helping Herschel get across the finish line,\" Paradise said.\u00a0 The Walker campaign manager said Republicans nationwide are \"fired up\" after a lackluster midterm showing, and that they will use that disappointment to rally support for their cause. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"We\u2019re very comfortable framing this as the last fight of \u201922,\" he said.

This Veterans Day weekend, it\u2019s worth remembering this American hero \u2014 and all he stood for.\u00a0\u00a0 Significantly, Freeman was the last surviving member of Easy Company, 506th PIR, 101st Airborne \u2014 the legendary World War II paratroopers known as the Band of Brothers.\u00a0\u00a0 Our culture will be poorer without them. In an age where it\u2019s become commonplace to be obnoxious and divisive, the Band of Brothers set the standard for noble living. During World War II, they battled oppression with courage and honor. In post-war America, they modeled service to our country with excellence, dignity and unity.\u00a0\u00a0 MEET THE AMERICAN WHO INSPIRED THE NATION IN TWO WORLD WARS: CHRISTIAN SOLDIER SGT. ALVIN YORK I spent more than six years interviewing the Band of Brothers and writing about them. I met many of them in person, along with their spouses, children and grandchildren, at reunions and in their homes.\u00a0\u00a0 They were the real deal.\u00a0 The Band of Brothers formed at Camp Toccoa, Georgia, under the tough and controversial Captain Herbert Sobel. After training stateside, the men rode the troop ship, Samaria, to Aldbourne, England, for further battle preparation.\u00a0\u00a0 They parachuted into Normandy on D-Day and later jumped into Holland for Operation Market Garden.\u00a0\u00a0 They fought their way through Belgium, France and Germany, survived overwhelming odds, liberated concentration camps, and drank a victory toast in April 1945 at Hitler\u2019s hideout in the Alps.\u00a0\u00a0 Along the way, they encountered horrors and victories and welded themselves into a family. They helped swing the tide of World War II, and ultimately the course of history.\u00a0\u00a0 The first significant chronicle of their story was the 1992 book by historian Stephen Ambrose, \"Band of Brothers.\" In 2001, Tom Hanks and Stephen Spielberg turned Ambrose\u2019s book into a ten-part HBO miniseries by the same name. The series won six Emmys and numerous other awards, and still runs frequently on various networks around the world.\u00a0\u00a0 After the war, and particularly after the series soared, many of the men became household names. Their qualities became measures of greatness.\u00a0\u00a0 Major Dick Winters was known for his impeccable leadership. He modeled grace under fire, solid character, and unswerving integrity.\u00a0\u00a0 \"Wild\" Bill Guarnere and Edward \"Babe\" Heffron were best friends who fought side by side through life\u2019s hardest difficulties. Postwar, they appeared together at an uncountable number of events nationwide and overseas, constantly championing veteran causes and the value of freedom.\u00a0\u00a0 Lt. Buck Compton had played baseball at UCLA with Jackie Robinson. After the war, Buck threw himself into public service and became an attorney and later a judge, known for his brilliance and fairness. He prosecuted Sirhan Sirhan for the murder of Bobby Kennedy.\u00a0\u00a0 Shifty Powers, a backwoods machinist from the small coal-mining town of Clinchco, Virginia, proved that every person, no matter how unassuming, can lead an extraordinary life.\u00a0\u00a0 When describing his former enemies, Powers famously said, \"That man and I might have been good friends. We might\u2019ve had a lot in common. He might have liked to fish. He might have liked to hunt. Course, they was doing what they was supposed to do, and I was trying to do what I was supposed to do. But under different circumstances, we might have been good friends.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 And Freeman, the last brother? Following the war, he returned to the United States and married his childhood sweetheart. The couple had two daughters. He finished college and while operating a farm, worked as a mail carrier for more than 30 years.\u00a0 I met Freeman several times at various military gatherings, but per his wishes I never formally interviewed him for a book. He had already said all he wanted to say, he told me.\u00a0 CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER He was perhaps best known for a brief mention in Ambrose\u2019s book, when he responded to a 1990 letter from Winters, his commanding officer during the war.

We have a good shade to sit in summer and have a good heater for winter. About all that I do is garden and cut hay for cows in summer and feed in winter. Fish and hunt the rest of the time. I have a good place on the front porch to sit. Here\u2019s hoping that you will come down sometime.\"\u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Winters did, and they had a good visit.

        " \n        By\n        Kelly Laco   | Fox News ",
        " FIRST ON FOX: The United States must catch up to China's digital currency in order to avoid a threat to America's \"dollar dominance,\" economic experts say in a new policy volume compiled by former House Speaker Paul Ryan. \"American Renewal: A Conservative Plan to Strengthen the Social Contract and Save the Country\u2019s Finances\" outlines solutions to America's emerging fiscal crisis that is \"entirely of its own making.\" It features policy prescriptions from 19 scholars, mostly from the American Enterprise Institute, and is aimed at pushing concrete solutions that Congress can enact before the country is engulfed in a \"debt catastrophe.\" Ryan, R-Wis., told Fox News Digital in an interview ahead of the book's release that it was \"designed to prevent America from going down the path of a debt crisis and losing the dollar as the world's reserve currency.\" PAUL RYAN SAYS MCCARTHY WILL CLINCH SPEAKERSHIP, ANYONE \u2018NOT NAMED TRUMP\u2019 CAN BEAT BIDEN \"If we lose the dollar as the world's reserve currency, it will massively inflict fiscal and monetary damage to our country. It will make it harder for us to finance our government, our social safety net and our economy, frankly, because interest rates will be much higher,\" he said. \"The fiscal policies in this book are proposals designed to fix these programs so that they're reliable and solvent and that they don't go into a debt crisis.\" The former speaker wrote in a forward to the volume released Thursday that America's system of \"self-governance\" established over the last 250 years is being challenged worldwide by \"by China\u2019s repressive regime and other authoritarian strongholds.\" \"The rules that apply to other nations don\u2019t always apply to the United States, or at least not in the exact same way. Yet the U.S. cannot forever defy the laws of economic gravity,\" the forward said, referencing the more than $31 trillion the country holds in national debt and 40-year inflation high. FTX'S SAM BANKMAN-FRIED COLLAPSE COMPARED TO ENRON, MADOFF Ryan says that \"the world is going to digital currencies,\" which presents both a challenge and opportunity for the U.S. as the new technology is taking over worldwide. \"If America wants to maintain its place as the keeper of the reserve currency of the world, which gives us huge privileges and advantages as a country, then we too should digitize our dollar so that we have the attributes of a digital dollar, which is frictionless money, which is much more efficient money,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"But more importantly, show the world how a free society should handle this challenge by having a two-tier system which guarantees the government has no role in the management of our money. Because the Chinese, the way they will manage money, violate privacy and liberty.\" INSIDE THE COLLAPSE OF CRYPTO EXCHANGE FTX: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW The former speaker said a proposal for a central bank digital currency (CBDC), presented by leading economic scholar and former member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors Kevin Warsh, is a tool that will advance national interests by encouraging competition without unnecessary government intrusion. \"The two tier [CBDC] system guarantees that there \u2026 is a layer between the citizen and the government for the money,\" Ryan explained. \"That's why that proposal is there, because we know where the world is going. We want to get ahead of it. And we want to make sure that we can lead the world in making sure that digital money maintains our core principles of privacy and liberty.\" Warsh, now a Hoover Institution scholar, made the case for a U.S. CBDC that could be a solution to the problems that other digital currencies pose. \"I do not expect China\u2019s fiat currency to dislodge the U.S. dollar on the world stage in the next decade,\" wrote Warsh, who sits on the boards of UPS and Coupang, a leading Korean e-commerce company. \"But the coupling of two powerful trends \u2014 \u00a0the emergence of great-power rivalry and the technological revolution in financial infrastructure catalyzed by the creation of blockchain technology \u2014 represents a consequential threat to the extant American-led financial architecture.\" \"Unless American policymakers recognize the new technology frontier, the U.S. runs the risk of losing the privilege of currency dominance,\" said Warsh. The book is designed to \"start debate\" in Congress in order to fix the problems facing the nation. PAUL RYAN BLAMES DISAPPOINTING GOP ELECTION RESULTS ON 'TRUMP HANGOVER' \"And what this book is attempting to do is to start that debate. It is to get our country and our political leaders and policymakers looking at and talking about the really big problems confronting America,\" said Ryan. \"And if we're going to compete successfully with China, then we're going to have to fix our problems from within,\" he stated. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Ryan's biggest achievement in his 20 years in Congress was his tax reform plan, he told Fox News Digital, calling it an \"immensely important down payment.\" But he said that \"we can go even further in the same direction and deliver even better results for the American people with an even better tax system, building on the successes we got in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. And this is a proposal to do that.\"",

    "Freedom Caucus demanding McCarthy cede some power as price for support": [
        " \n        By\n        Haris Alic   | Fox News ",
        " The Freedom Caucus is pushing for the Republican leader to hand more power to his caucus, demanding stronger roles for House committee chairs in exchange for backing Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy for speaker.\u00a0 The conservative House Freedom Caucus, which boasts more than 40 members, is proposing a wide array of changes to House rules ahead of a floor vote in January on McCarthy's speakership bid. The conservative lawmakers want to gut the speaker's ability to appoint committee chairmen, instead allowing a panel's individual members to vote on the position. \"Each member of Congress has earned and deserves equal participation in the legislative process,\" said Rep. Matt Rosendale, a Montana Republican.\u00a0 At the moment, Republican committee chairmen and members are chosen by the internal steering committee. The panel is made up of leadership allies, with individual members also allowed to run for seats representing regions of the country.\u00a0 MODERATE HOUSE GOP READY TO PUSH BACK AGAINST FREEDOM CAUCUS RULE CHANGES Leadership allies say the process is open and fair and ensures no single person has total control. Critics say that McCarthy and other top Republicans dominate the panel, rewarding supporters and punishing members likely to buck leadership. As proof, members of the Freedom Caucus cite that several of their members have been left off of committees that would appear to be a natural fit.\u00a0 HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS WANTS OPTION OF REMOVING THE SPEAKER AS PRICE FOR GIVING MCCARTHY THE GAVEL \"Committees should have people on them that have experience in that field,\" said Rep. Diana Harshbarger, R-Tenn. \"That's just common sense to me.\" McCarthy's allies pushed back on the assertion, noting that several high-profile committees were stacked with individuals whose backgrounds perfectly fit the panels' area of jurisdiction. \"You have to remember that people have their roles,\" said Rep. Dave Joyce, R-Ohio. Freedom Caucus member Warren Davidson, he noted, \"is on the Financial Services Committee, and that makes sense because he ran a business. [Rep.] Brad Wenstrup is a doctor, and he's on the Ways and Means Committee, which touches on health policy.\" Outside of committee assignments and chairmen, the Freedom Caucus also wants to restore regular order in the House. That means requiring every single piece of major legislation to be debated and voted in committee before heading to the House floor. Freedom Caucus hardliners say a return to regular order is especially important on budget and appropriations bills. Congress in recent years has seen such bills assembled on the floor by leadership and passed with limited debate. In some cases, House leaders even vote to suspend normal operating procedures to expedite legislation. \"I don't think I even know what regular order is,\" said Harshbarger, a pharmacist who was first elected in 2020. The Freedom Caucus is pushing a rules change proposal that would require all legislation to go through committee and be public for more than 72 hours before being voted on. The group also is pushing for a ban on bills being tied together and passed en bloc. The Freedom Caucus wants more control over the House Rules Committee, which has authority over how legislation comes to the floor and is voted on. \"It's probably the most powerful committee no one has ever heard of,\" said one Freedom Caucus member. \"The committee can write a rule saying that if a bill to rename a local post office in Kentucky passes then another bill with major policy implications is \u2018deemed passed.\u2019\" The Freedom Caucus wants the Republican conference to nominate and elect the chairman and members of the House Rules Committee. That push, like many of the rule changes proposed by the Freedom Caucus, faces an uphill battle.\u00a0 But the hard-line conservatives feel as though they have leverage because of last week's election results. At the low end, the GOP could wind up with a 218-seat majority, the bare minimum needed to control the House. If Republicans sweep all outstanding races, including some in which Democrats are favored, the majority could reach as high as 226 seats. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP McCarthy, the GOP's designated candidate for speaker, will need at least 218 votes on the House floor in January to clinch the job. During an initial test vote this week, the would-be speaker fell more than 30 votes short of that target because of opposition from hardliners. Conservatives say that in order to receive their support for speaker on the floor, McCarthy will have to offer concessions on House rules. Restoring regular order and the independence of committee chairs is one place that can start, they claim. \"I think those are important to empower regular members to have the influence in Congress that their constituents elected them to have,\" said Rep. Bob Good, R-Va.",

        " President Biden Thursday disputed comments made by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who remains confident that the \"explosion\" that killed two in Poland did not come from a Ukrainian missile.\u00a0 \"That\u2019s not the evidence,\" Biden told reporters from the South Lawn after arriving in Washington shortly after 12:30 a.m. Zelenskyy on Wednesday countered comments from NATO and Polish officials who said preliminary evidence suggested the \"explosion\" that killed two Poles in the village of\u00a0Przewodow, roughly 30 miles from the Ukrainian border, likely came from Ukraine\u2019s air defense system. POLISH PRESIDENT SAYS 'NO PROOF' MISSILE THAT LANDED IN NATO TERRITORY WAS FIRED BY RUSSIA \"I have no doubt this was not our missile and not our missile strike,\" Zelenskyy reportedly told Ukrainian media from a news conference in Kyiv, adding he had been given assurances from his top commanders. The tragic event Tuesday sparked international furor after one anonymous U.S. official apparently inaccurately told The Associated Press that a Russian missile had struck NATO territory \u2013 sparking immediate concern over how the member nations would react. Zelenskyy later acknowledged that it could not be ruled out that debris from its air defense system crashed into Poland after Russia carried out dozens of strikes across Ukraine earlier this week. \"But there is an investigation for this,\" he said. NATO SAYS RUSSIA 'ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE' FOR DEATHS IN POLAND THAT MAY HAVE BEEN FROM AIR DEFENSE MISSILE The Ukrainian president questioned this theory and pointed to the size of the impact area\\, which he said was roughly 65 feet in diameter and 16 feet deep. \"I have my own opinion,\" he added. \"I believe that this is a Russian missile.\" Kyiv has called on NATO and Poland to allow Ukraine to help with the investigation, and Zelenskyy said if it is found to have come from Ukraine\u2019s defense system, he would like to see that evidence.\u00a0 \"If some debris killed these people, then we need to apologize. We are honest people,\" he added.\u00a0 Western officials, including NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, said Wednesday that despite preliminary evidence, Kyiv was not at fault and well within its right to strike down an incoming Russian missile. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin echoed this sentiment and told reporters that \"whatever the final conclusions may be, the world knows that Russia bears ultimate responsibility for this incident.\"\u00a0 \"Russia launched another barrage of missiles against Ukraine specifically intended to target Ukraine's civilian infrastructure,\" he said Wednesday. \"And Ukraine has a bedrock right to defend itself.\" The investigation into the explosion remains ongoing.\u00a0",

Ukrainian interior minister Denys Monastyrsky says investigators found 436 instances of war crimes in the region, including four facilities where torture took place. \"Now, 63 bodies have been discovered in Kherson region, but we must understand that the search has only just started so many more dungeons and burial places will be uncovered,\" Monastyrsky told Ukrainian television, according to Reuters.\u00a0 \"Investigators are currently examining them and setting down every instance of torture.

        " Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn is renewing her push to end the firing of U.S. service members who have refused to take a COVID-19 vaccine under the Biden administration's vaccine mandate.\u00a0 The Tennessee lawmaker said Wednesday that protecting the troops is her top priority as Congress reconvenes in its lame duck session to consider the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) \u2013 a must-pass spending bill that funds the military and other national security programs. Blackburn is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and has introduced two bills to protect service members from being discharged by President Biden's COVID-19 policies.\u00a0 \"We\u2019re continuing to push this. When you have a military that is not meeting either its recruitment numbers or its end strength numbers, then it is imperative that we look at this,\" Blackburn told Breitbart News in an interview.\u00a0 \"We are reaching out to different members trying to make certain that they are fully aware of what we are trying to do, and working with leadership to make certain that we protect the men and women in uniform,\" she said. HOUSE REPUBLICANS DEMAND ANSWERS ON PENTAGON COVID VACCINE MANDATE AMID PUNISHMENTS FOR UNVAXXED SOLDIERS About 8,000 active-duty service members have been discharged from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps since Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin imposed the COVID-19 vaccine mandate in August 2021. Blackburn's office noted in a press release Tuesday that the Army has only approved 55 religious exemptions for active duty soldiers, one exemption of a National Guard soldier, and one for an Army reserve soldier.\u00a0 DEMOCRATS REFUSE TO EXAMINE \u2018UNACCEPTABLE\u2019 VETERAN HEALTH CARE DELAYS In October, the Army reported a 25% recruitment shortfall, missing its target by about 15,000 soldiers. Opponents of the vaccine mandate have cited the policy as a contributing factor to depressed military recruitment, but the Army has noted that only 23% of 17- to 24-year-olds in America are eligible for service due to failing test scores, obesity rates, concerns over sexual harassment in the military and bountiful employment opportunities as civilians. Blackburn said that continuing to discharge service members for refusing to get a COVID-19 shot amid historic recruitment shortfalls is nonsensical.\u00a0 SERVICE MEMBERS SOUND ALARM AGAINST \u2018EXTREMELY WOKE\u2019 MILITARY She has introduced two pieces of legislation that would amend the NDAA. The first, introduced in July, would prohibit federal funds from being used to enforce the vaccine mandate against a member of the National Guard. The second, put forward in September, would limit COVID-related seperations until recruiting benchmarks are met and guarantee that service members applying for religious and health exemptions from the vaccine mandate continue to receive pay and benefits.\u00a0 Blackburn argued that the military vaccine mandate is ineffective because some who receive the COVID-19 vaccine and booster shots are still susceptible to breakthrough infections.\u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"You can get the COVID vaccine, but it does not prohibit you from getting COVID. And this has been proven time and again from people who have been double-vaxxed and boosted, but they still come down with COVID,\" she told Breitbart News.\u00a0 \"To dismiss these men and women in the military, in the Guard, in the reserves, at our academies because they did not get a shot, is ridiculous.

        " The family of Sam Bankman-Fried, the beleaguered founder of the now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, has significant ties to the Democratic establishment in Washington, D.C. The FTX CEO's family \u2014 consisting of his parents, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, and brother Gabe Bankman-Fried \u2014 has contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democratic candidates and actively worked with left-wing organizations committed to supporting Democrats. The four appear to have had subtle influence on the Democratic establishment for the better part of a decade. \"We\u2019re ambitious and looking to make a splash,\" Gabe Bankman-Fried said in an interview with NBC News in May. The Bankman-Fried brothers have led joint efforts to raise money to prevent future pandemics. Of the $38 million Sam Bankman-Fried donated to political campaigns and groups during the midterm election, about $27 million went to Protect Our Future PAC, a political action committee dedicated to boosting candidates who would push forward anti-pandemic policies, according to Federal Election Commission data. WHAT IS THE ALLEGED CONNECTION BETWEEN SAM BANKMAN-FRIED, FTX, DEMOCRATS AND UKRAINE? The PAC only gave money to Democrats and the gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety Victory Fund. Bankman-Fried's donations to the PAC represented more than 99.5% of its total money raised. Gabe Bankman-Fried, who has contributed more than $361,000 to mainly Democratic campaigns and causes over the last several years, founded the group Guarding Against Pandemics. The group researches and endorses candidates who then often receive cash from Protect Our Future PAC. HERE ARE THE DEMS WHO BENEFITED FROM THE LEFT-WING PAC THAT FTX FUNNELED $27M THROUGH A webpage highlighting Gabe Bankman-Fried's role starting Guarding Against Pandemics on the group's website was recently wiped, but was archived and reviewed by Fox News Digital. The webpage stated that he was previously a legislative correspondent for Rep. Sean Casten, D-Ill., on Capitol Hill between 2019 and 2021 \u2014 and worked for Civis Analytics, a data firm that works hand-in-hand with Democratic PACs. Civis Analytics has positioned itself as a Democratic powerhouse in recent years. The firm was \"born\" from President Obama's campaign after Eric Schmidt, the former Google CEO and executive chairman of Alphabet, helped as a recruiter and trainer for the campaign and later teamed up with Dan Wagner, the chief analytics officer for Obama's 2012 campaign, to help launch the company. Schmidt provided seed money for the firm and helped gather tens of millions of dollars in funding. Civis has since been on the payroll of several major Democratic committees, including presidential contenders. As Gabe Bankman-Fried worked for the firm during the 2018 election cycle, Civis received nearly $4.4 million from the likes of the Senate Majority PAC, House Majority PAC, Priorities USA Action, Democratic National Committee and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. The cash was primarily for research and data analytics consulting, FEC filings shows.\u00a0 And Sam Bankman-Fried's parents have also been involved with Democratic lawmakers and groups. Together, the pair have contributed more than $196,000 to mainly Democrats, FEC records show. In addition, Barbara Fried leads Mind the Gap, a secretive organization that funnels massive amounts of money to Democratic campaigns, according to Influence Watch. The group has received major funding from well-known Silicon Valley donors including Schmidt, the former Google CEO; Dustin Moskovitz, the co-founder of Facebook; Allen Blue, the co-founder of LinkedIn; and Jeff Horing, the co-founder of top venture capital firm Insight Partners. FTX FOUNDER SAM BANKMAN-FRIED'S CRYPTO COLLAPSE APOLOGY \"The core mission of Mind the Gap is to empower private political donors to strengthen our democracy by providing them with evidence-based guidance on the electoral strategies, tactics, and programs that are likely to achieve the greatest impact in a given election cycle,\" the group's mission states. \"Drawing on rigorous research conducted over multiple elections, Mind the Gap uses quantifiable metrics to vet and compare promising programs and to direct donors to the organizations and tactics most likely to increase the probability of Democratic victory in key races.\" Fried's connection to Schmidt is notable since he emerged as a key power player ahead of the midterm elections this month, giving millions of dollars to Democrats and bankrolling STAC Labs, a start-up tech firm that builds out data infrastructure for progressives. Schmidt also still serves on Civis Analytics' board of directors. In 2018, Mind the Gap paid Civis about $90,000 for data analytics services.

        " It was a sober and serious Donald Trump, painting an overly rosy and sometimes misleading picture of his tenure, said he would lead an \"American comeback\" and accused President Biden with substantial hyperbole of \"leading us to the brink of nuclear war.\"\u00a0 \"The Washington establishment wants to silence us,\" said the man who redefined the Republican Party,\" vowing to defeat Joe Biden as the face of radical leftism and corruption in declaring his presidential candidacy. Trump said he left office \"at the pinnacle of power, prosperity and prestige,\" when the economy had been flattened by the pandemic. \"When the virus hit our shores, I took decisive action,\" Trump said, who has acknowledged repeatedly playing it down to avoid a panic, though he deserves credit for the warp-speed vaccine program. His one reference to his stolen-election charges came after he boasted of slapping tariffs on China. Therefore, many people think \"China played a very active role in the 2020 election\u2013just saying.\" But he mostly stuck to the policy script before an array of American flags at Mar-a-Lago. TRUMP READY TO RUN, AS MANY BLAME HIM FOR MIDTERMS, BUT HIS BASE WILL DECIDE Trump insisted that the media would not report that his record in the midterms was 232 wins and 22 losses, though most of those were candidates on their way to victory. Instead, he ignored that many of his MAGA candidates lost, allowing Democrats to keep control of the Senate and drawing flak even from many in conservative media. The press, he said, was \"still trying to blame us.\" Speaking of the media, CNN took the first 25 minutes of the speech, Fox News carried 40 minutes, and MSNBC made a point of studiously ignoring a former president formally announcing for his old job\u2013though will undoubtedly talk about it all day today. The former president took legitimate shots at his successor: inflation, a porous border, the chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal (though Biden inherited the pullout that Trump had negotiated).\u00a0 He boasted a good relationship with Kim Jong-un, but those talks led to nothing and now North Korea has resumed missile testing. He declared that Russia would not have invaded Ukraine had he remained in office.\u00a0 When Trump accused Biden of ruining the country, he - calling cities \"cesspools of violent crime and declaring that \"the Biden administration has destroyed the U.S. economy.\" It wasn\u2019t exactly the environment in which Trump was planning to launch his third bid for the White House. Some of his closest past allies were practically begging him not to make the announcement, and the lack of Republican enthusiasm was palpable. A Politico headline yesterday morning said \"Republicans Cringe as Trump 2024 Approaches\"--not exactly throwing out the welcome mat. Washington Post columnist Marc Thiessen, calling Trump \"one of the greatest conservative presidents in modern times,\" nonetheless greeted him with this yesterday: \"Mr. President, it is not in your interest to run in 2024. If you do, you will likely lose. And you will destroy what remains of your legacy in the process. Please, don\u2019t do it.\" Wyoming GOP Sen. Cynthia Lummis said in the Politico piece: \"Who is the\u00a0 current leader of the Republican Party?...Ron DeSantis is the leader of the Republican Party, whether he wants to be or not.\"\u00a0 The No. 2 Senate Republican, John Thune, said he wouldn\u2019t endorse anyone in a contested primary, adding: \"It\u2019s clear that running on relitigating the 2020 election is not a winning strategy.\" Now Trump retains a very strong hold on the MAGA base, though we won\u2019t know whether that\u2019s been weakened until the voting starts. HOW THE MEDIA MISSED WHAT BECAME A ROUGH NIGHT FOR TRUMP AND THE GOP Various polls showing DeSantis leading Trump in this or that state are meaningless at this point. Those numbers will look different once he\u2019s under daily attack. National Review\u2019s Jim Geraghty noted that DeSantis can wait six months before jumping, leaving Trump to run against himself\u2013and, I would add, the media and his Republican critics. Asked at a presser yesterday about Trump\u2019s attacks, the governor deftly deflected by saying when you lead, \"you take incoming fire\u2026what you learn is all that\u2019s just noise\u2026I would just tell people to go check out the scoreboard from last Tuesday night,\" the landslide winner said. What\u2019s striking is that after all the many controversies of the Trump presidency\u2013from two impeachments to January 6\u2013some of his backers jumped ship only making the cold calculation that he is a loser.

    "Trump ready to run, as many blame him for midterms, but his base will decide": [
        " \n        By\n        Howard Kurtz   | Fox News ",
        " With Democrats somehow keeping control of the Senate in an absolutely awful political environment, Donald Trump is getting the lion\u2019s share of the blame. So of course he\u2019s announcing his presidential candidacy tonight. From media liberals and Democrats who can hardly believe their good fortune to some conservative pundits and Republican politicians, the consensus is that Trump took the focus off an unpopular President Biden and made the election all about him. He was at it again over the weekend, with screeds against Ron \u2018DeSanctimonious\u2019 and Glenn \u2018Young Kin,\u2019 not to mention Fox, fake news and Old Crow Mitch McConnell, bringing back that slur about his wife, Coco Chow. Trump also claimed without evidence that there was voter fraud in Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly\u2019s win over his guy, Blake Masters, when everyone knew (and endlessly explained) that mail ballots counted after Election Day could enable Democrats to catch up and possibly win. HOW THE MEDIA MISSED WHAT BECAME A ROUGH NIGHT FOR TRUMP AND THE GOP That Biden\u2019s party could hold the Senate without next month\u2019s Georgia runoff is remarkable. But the president sure would like to have a 51st vote out of the Herschel Walker-Raphael Warnock runoff or Joe Manchin again becomes the Democrat with the biggest nuclear weapon.\u00a0 With 2020 hindsight it\u2019s clear that what was lost in all the red wave talk (which went far beyond Fox, as I showed on \"Media Buzz\") is that younger people turned out in much greater numbers than expected, and that abortion rights drove turnout more forcefully among suburban white women and others. There was also the preserving democracy argument, and President Biden\u2019s prime-time speech on that issue, which I and others viewed as a missed opportunity while the country was focused on inflation and crime. Turns out Biden may have motivated some folks to get out there. Every election denier who ran for secretary of state or top elections official was defeated. And there was ticket splitting, with a more conventional Republican like Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp winning by a significant margin while Walker was held below 50 percent. There was a lot of hype about Trump-backed Tudor Dixon being in a tight race, but Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer beat her by just over double digits. Trump was back at it for his Arizona gubernatorial candidate, election denier Kari Lake, who could still win but has fallen a bit further behind as more votes are counted. He said \"the great Kari Lake\u2019s easy election win is slowly, yet systematically, being drained away from her,\" as if there were something nefarious about continuing the ballot count.\u00a0 So how will Trump\u2019s telegraphed announcement tonight play out? MSNBC and CNN are likely to provide heavy coverage because they miss the Trumpian ratings of his presidency. The conservative media outlets and commentators \u2013 from the New York Post and Wall Street Journal to National Review and Washington Examiner, some of which favor DeSantis, will criticize his candidacy from the right. Mike Pence, who\u2019s eyeing the race, said in an interview with ABC\u2019s David Muir what everyone in America knows but that he hasn\u2019t uttered until now: \"The president's words were reckless and his actions were reckless,\" Pence said of Trump tweeting that his VP \"lacked the courage\" to block Biden\u2019s Electoral College circulation.\u00a0 \"The president's words that day at the rally endangered me and my family and everyone at the Capitol building,\" Pence said. \"I turned to my daughter, who was standing nearby, and I said, 'It doesn't take courage to break the law. It takes courage to uphold the law.\u2019\" RED WAVE? THE MEDIA GRAPPLE WITH AN UNDECIDED BATTLE FOR CONTROL OF CONGRESS And listen to Republican Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama, a onetime Trump ally, speaking to AL.com: \"It would be a bad mistake for the Republicans to have Donald Trump as their nominee in 2024. Donald Trump has proven himself to be dishonest, disloyal, incompetent, crude and a lot of other things that alienate so many independents and Republicans.\"\u00a0 What gives? Brooks lost Trump\u2019s endorsement and lost his primary. So can most Republicans only say such things when they\u2019re leaving office. But slow down \u2013 we haven\u2019t heard from the voters yet. For all the times that the media have declared Trump finished, including after Jan. 6, his iron grip on the MAGA base has rescued him. We don\u2019t even know whether DeSantis will run, and if he does, he\u2019s untested as a national candidate. If Trump is the nominee, as I\u2019ve been saying for a long time, it\u2019s far more likely that Biden will run as the only person who has beaten him. And all the Democrats who have clamored for a younger candidate have yet to name the person who can beat Trump after a negative onslaught.The New York Times has an intriguing take on this, given that Biden is about to turn 80. While the midterms gave the president a boost, party insiders are deeply worried that Kamala Harris can\u2019t win: \"While there are many other would-be contenders, none of them have impressed the president enough for him to feel comfortable turning the party over to them. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Some Democrats argue that this is a situation of Mr. Biden\u2019s own making, having failed to successfully groom a potential successor, consciously or not making himself the indispensable man. But either way, it leaves many Democrats circling back to the conclusion that Mr. Biden remains the party\u2019s best choice.\" I don\u2019t think it was a Machiavellian plot, but if DeSantis or some other next-generation Republican wins the nomination, the pressure on Biden to step aside or be primaried will grow. Or we may see a rematch after all.\u00a0",

        " Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Wednesday shut down reporters asking about a purported \"GOP Civil War\" after former President Donald Trump announced his third bid for the White House.\u00a0 DeSantis, widely seen as Trump's most formidable potential opponent in a Republican presidential primary, dismissed a reporter's question about Republican infighting following the party's mixed results in the 2022 midterm elections, telling reporters to \"chill out.\"\u00a0 \"We just finished this election, OK?

Others like Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., won re-election in closer than expected races, and the GOP is projected to win control of the House of Representatives with a thin majority. In the aftermath of the election, those disappointing results were unfavorably compared to DeSantis' stunning 19-point landslide re-election in Florida, where he lifted down-ballot candidates like Sen. Marco Rubio to easy victory, flipped three congressional seats and expanded GOP majorities in the state legislature.

        " One of the House Democrats who led the second impeachment effort against former President Trump is rallying support in Congress for a bill to bar Trump from holding public office again. \u00a0 Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., on Tuesday sent a letter to his Democratic colleagues arguing that Trump has \"forfeited his right to ever hold federal office again for leading an insurrection against the United States.\" He asked for co-sponsors on legislation that would prevent Trump from holding public office again under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\u00a0 The letter was circulated to House Democrats hours before Trump announced his third campaign for the White House.\u00a0 Cicilline, who House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., named as an impeachment manager after the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, accused Trump of instigating an \"insurrection\" against the government and argued the Constitution bars him from becoming president again.

    "Walker, Republicans look for party unity in Georgia runoff": [
        "By BILL BARROWNovember 17, 2022 GMT",
        " AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) \u2014 Republicans insist they\u2019re working together to help Herschel Walker unseat Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock in a Georgia runoff that offers the GOP a chance to finish a disappointing midterm election season with a victory. But to win a 50th Senate seat on Dec. 6 and limit Democrats\u2019 continued majority, Republicans must overcome doubts about Walker\u2019s appeal in a battleground state, navigate open squabbles among party powerbrokers in Washington and endure the specter of former President Donald Trump as he launches his third White House bid after losing Georgia in 2020. It adds up to the same challenges that limited GOP victories nationally despite an underwater approval rating for President Joe Biden and widespread frustrations with the nation\u2019s direction.  \u201cEverybody realizes that regardless of any disagreements that do or don\u2019t exist, everybody needs to focus on one thing: helping Herschel get across the finish line,\u201d said Walker campaign manager Scott Paradise. But they must do it without the Senate majority on the line, as it was in a pair of Georgia runoffs in January 2021. Democrats have already secured 50 seats with narrow incumbent victories in Nevada and Arizona combined with flipping a GOP-held Pennsylvania seat, and Vice President Kamala\u2019s Harris tiebreaking vote assures them a majority. So, Walker, who spent the fall trying to nationalize his race by mocking Warnock as a yes-man for Biden, must fashion a runoff coalition knowing that nothing voters do here will depose New York\u2019s Chuck Schumer as Senate majority leader. \u201cThere are still national implications,\u201d Paradise said, arguing that Republicans around the country are \u201cfired up\u201d for a second chance after an underwhelming midterm performance. \u201cWe\u2019re very comfortable framing this as the last fight of \u201922.\u201d Like many losing GOP nominees this year, Walker has struggled among moderates and independents, with many questioning his qualifications, according to AP VoteCast surveys of voters. Walker trailed Warnock by about 35,000 votes out of almost 4 million. Perhaps more tellingly, the same electorate gave Republican Gov. Brian Kemp 200,000 more votes than Walker \u2014 enough for a comfortable reelection victory. Walker, a former college and professional football star and a close friend of Trump\u2019s, was urged by the former president to run. That cements Walker\u2019s bond with core GOP supporters but presents a challenge in Republican-leaning metro areas that helped Biden top Trump here two years ago. \u201cTrump probably does more to juice Democratic turnout than have an effect on our guy,\u201d said Josh Holmes, a prominent Republican fundraiser and strategist aligned with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has icy relations with the former president. But Holmes added, \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the impact will be.\u201d It\u2019s clear Republicans hope Kemp\u2019s popularity extends to Walker, even if it wasn\u2019t enough in the first round. Kemp avoided Walker throughout the fall, pointedly not saying the Senate candidate\u2019s name when asked about Walker\u2019s difficulties, which include exaggerated claims about his business, philanthropic and academic record; accusations of violence against his first wife; and claims by two former girlfriends that Walker paid for their abortions despite his public opposition to abortion rights. Kemp typically would say only that he backed \u201cthe entire Republican ticket.\u201d Since Election Day, though, Kemp has turned over his voter turnout operation to the Washington-based super PAC aligned with McConnell. And Kemp plans to campaign with Walker for the first time Saturday.  \u201cHerschel requested all the help we could get from the governor. The governor said I\u2019m there for you,\u201d Paradise said. Yet the deal between Kemp and the Senate Leadership Fund highlights GOP fissures, some tracing back to Trump, others to a running feud between McConnell and Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who leads the Senate GOP\u2019s campaign arm.  Kemp built out his independent turnout operation after the 2020 presidential election, when Trump blasted Kemp for certifying Biden\u2019s slate of presidential electors from Georgia and state Republican Party leaders sided mostly with Trump. SLF, which usually spends most of its money on television advertising, said the runoff would be the first time the political action committee has engaged in a full-scale voter turnout effort. But, as with Kemp\u2019s reelection campaign, that comes at odds with the traditional coordinated party campaign run through the Republican National Committee, the state party and Scott\u2019s National Republican Senatorial Committee. Separately, Scott challenged McConnell for Senate GOP leader; McConnell prevailed Wednesday.  Campaigning for Walker this week on the outskirts of Augusta, Scott sought to present a united GOP front. \u201cWhat we ought to be doing now is focusing all of our time on Herschel,\u201d he said. But he noted that federal election law prevents coordination between the party committees and the SLF-Kemp operation. That means that there\u2019s no legal way for each camp to keep tabs on the other\u2019s activities, raising the prospect of duplicative efforts or conflicting messages to voters. Meanwhile, Scott\u2019s and McConnell\u2019s advisers spilled their tiff into public view. Curt Anderson, a Scott ally, noted on Twitter that he\u2019d seen Schumer\u2019s Democratic super PAC airing ads on Warnock\u2019s behalf during a \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d broadcast. \u201cMcConnell\u2019s superpac running zero ads attacking Warnock. Have they given up?\u201d he asked. SLF President Steven Law retorted that the NRSC\u2019s Georgia televisions buys have been subpar. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry little buddy \u2014 we\u2019re used to covering you,\u201d he wrote. SLF has since announced its own $14.2 million advertising plan, on top of the $2 million-plus it had previously announced for its turnout operation. Amid such intraparty complications, perhaps the best outcome for Walker is a relatively low-turnout runoff election that allows his core supporters to become a victorious majority. Indeed, having the Senate majority already settled could dampen Democrats\u2019 enthusiasm, and Walker has drawn large, enthusiastic crowds in the opening days of the runoff campaign. Yet Republicans, including the candidate himself, acknowledge at least tacitly that Walker may need supporters the nominee hasn\u2019t won over yet. For Walker, that means a retooled campaign speech that remains heavy on staunch conservative rhetoric but expands his attacks on Warnock to include an admonishment for not working closely enough with Kemp. \u201cWhat he been doing is rowing the boat this way as our governor is trying to row this way,\u201d Walker said of Warnock in Augusta. \u201cWhat I\u2019m going to do is I\u2019m going to row the boat with the governor.\u201d For Scott, it means bringing the complexities of Senate rules to the campaign trail, telling voters that a 50-50 Senate means evenly split committee rosters, while a 51-49 makeup means clear Democratic majorities. \u201cIt takes 51-plus to get things done,\u201d he said. And for rank-and-file Georgia Republicans like Debbie McCord, it means cajoling would-be Walker voters to look beyond individual candidates and see a national referendum. \u201cThere are people who just think \u2018so-and-so would have been a better candidate.\u2019 I say there are a lot of good candidates, but this is who won the primary,\u201d said McCord, chairwoman of the Columbia County Republican committee. \u201cYou need to get over it, put your big boy pants on and go vote.\u201d ___ Learn more about the issues and factors at play in the midterms at https://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-elections.

    "The AP Interview: Pence says voters want new leadership": [
        "By JILL COLVINNovember 17, 2022 GMT",
        " NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Former Vice President Mike Pence said Wednesday that voters are \u201clooking for new leadership\u201d following the disappointing midterm elections for Republicans, who are now openly debating whether his onetime boss, Donald Trump, should maintain a leading role in the party.  In an interview with The Associated Press just hours after Trump announced another White House run, Pence declined to say whether he thinks the former president is fit to return to his old job. But he implicitly positioned himself as a potential alternative for Republicans seeking conservative leadership without the chaos of the Trump era.  \u201dI think we will have better choices in 2024,\u201d Pence said. \u201cI\u2019m very confident that Republican primary voters will choose wisely.\u201d He said that he and his family will gather over the holidays \u201cand we\u2019ll give prayerful consideration to what our role might be in the days ahead.\u201d Asked whether he blamed Trump for this week\u2019s Republican losses, he said, \u201cCertainly the president\u2019s continued efforts to relitigate the last election played a role, but ... each individual candidate is responsible for their own campaign.\u201d Pence, while considering a presidential campaign of his own, has been raising his profile as he promotes his new memoir, \u201c So Help Me God,\u201d which was released on the same day that Trump made official his long-teased White House bid. If Pence moves forward, he would be in direct competition with Trump, a particularly awkward collision for the former vice president, who spent his four years in office defending Trump, refusing to criticize him publicly until after Jan. 6, 2021.  That\u2019s when a mob of Trump\u2019s supporters \u2014 driven by Trump\u2019s lie that Pence could somehow reject the election results \u2014 stormed the Capitol building while Pence was presiding over the certification of Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s victory. The vice president was steered to safety with his staff and family as some in the mob chanted, \u201cHang Mike Pence!\u201d  Still, Pence on Wednesday remained largely reticent to criticize Trump beyond the insurrection. That hesitance reflects the reality that the former president remains enormously popular with the GOP base that Pence would need to win over to be competitive in primary contests. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t exactly the style of presidency that I would have advanced had I been the first name on the ballot,\u201d Pence said of his unlikely partnership with Trump. \u201cBut it was his presidency and I was there to support him and help him. And until that fateful day in January 2021, I sought to do just that.\u201d Pence said he hadn\u2019t watched Trump\u2019s full announcement speech on Tuesday, but made the case that voters are looking for a new, less contentious direction. \u201cYou know, the president has every right to stand for election again,\u201d he said. But after traveling the country campaigning with midterm candidates, \u201cI have a genuine sense that the American people are looking for new leadership that could unite our country around our highest ideals and that would reflect the respect and civility the American people show to one another every day, while still advancing the policies that we advanced during those years of service,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s campaign launch comes as Republicans grapple with fallout from elections in which they failed to wrest control of the Senate and are on track to win only the narrowest majority in the House. Those results came despite voters\u2019 deep concerns over inflation and the direction of the country under Democrat Biden. Trump endorsed a long list of candidates in competitive states including Pennsylvania and Arizona who then lost their general election races. While Pence said he was pleased Republicans were taking the House, he acknowledged the election \u201cwasn\u2019t quite the red wave that we all had hoped for.\u201d  \u201cMy conclusion,\u201d he said, \u201cis the candidates that were focused on the future, focused on the challenges the American people are facing today and solutions to those challenges did quite well.\u201d But those still questioning the 2020 results \u2014 as Trump demanded \u2014 \u201cdid not do as well.\u201d In his new book, Pence writes in detail about his experience on Jan. 6, and he expounded on that Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget the simmering indignation that I felt that day, seeing those sights on the cellphones as we gathered in the loading dock below the Senate chamber. I couldn\u2019t help but think not this, not here, not in America,\u201d he said. In the interview, he recalled his reaction to Trump\u2019s tweets \u201cthat criticize me directly at a time that a riot was raging in the Capitol hallways.\u201d \u201cThe president\u2019s words were reckless, and they endangered my family and everyone at the Capitol building,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president had decided to be a part of the problem. I was determined to be a part of the solution.\u201d Asked what consequences Trump should face for his actions, however, Pence punted. \u201cThat\u2019s up to the American people,\u201d he said he believes. \u201cI truly do. And look, I\u2019ll always be proud of the record of the Trump administration for four-and-a-half years. President Trump was not just my president. He was my friend. And we worked closely together to advance the policies that we\u2019d been elected to serve.\u201d \u201cIt didn\u2019t end well,\u201d he acknowledged, in an understatement. \u201cAnd that tragic day in January will always be a day of great sadness for me, a sadness about what had happened to our relationship, to the bad advice the president was accepting from a group of lawyers that, as I write in my book, should never have been allowed on the White House grounds, let alone in the Oval Office. \u201d Pence and Trump were always an odd couple \u2014 a pugilistic, crude New York celebrity and a staid Midwestern evangelical who once wrote an essay on the evils of negative campaigning and who, as a rule, says he will not dine alone with a woman who is not his wife. Asked why he so rarely spoke up when Trump launched deeply personal insults against figures such as the late Sen. John McCain, Pence said, in effect, that that was what he had had signed up for. \u201cAs his vice president, I believed it was my role to be loyal to the president,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so every step of the way, the way I squared it was I believe that I had been elected vice president to support the presidency that Donald Trump had been elected to advance.\u201d  Indeed, Pence in the book writes that even after Jan. 6, the two men \u201cparted amicably when our service to the nation drew to a close.\u201d \u201cAnd in the weeks that followed, from time to time, he would call me and to speak and check in,\u201d Pence said in the interview. \u201cBut when he returned to criticizing me and others who had upheld the Constitution that day, I just decided I\u2019d be best to go our separate ways. And we have.\u201d Asked why he would part \u201camicably\u201d with Trump given the president\u2019s actions \u2014 including his decision not to call Pence to check in on his safety while the riot was underway \u2014 Pence said he believed the president had been genuinely regretful when they met for the first time after the 6th. \u201cFor the balance of about 90 minutes, we sat, we talked. I was very direct with the president. I made it clear to him that I believe that I did my duty that day, and I sensed genuine remorse on his part,\u201d Pence recalled. \u201cThe president and I had forged not only a good working relationship, but a friendship over four-and-a-half years. We worked together literally every day. But he was different in that time. I encouraged him to take the matter to prayer.\u201d As for his plans for the future, as everyone asks whether he plans to run, he and his family will gather over the holidays \u201cand we\u2019ll give prayerful consideration to what our role might be in the days ahead.\u201d",

    "Same-sex marriage legislation clears key Senate hurdle": [
        "By MARY CLARE JALONICKNovember 16, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Legislation to protect same-sex and interracial marriages crossed a major Senate hurdle Wednesday, putting Congress on track to take the historic step of ensuring that such unions are enshrined in federal law. Twelve Republicans voted with all Democrats to move forward on the legislation, meaning a final vote could come as soon as this week, or later this month. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said the bill ensuring the unions are legally recognized under the law is chance for the Senate to \u201clive up to its highest ideals\u201d and protect marriage equality for all people.  \u201cIt will make our country a better, fairer place to live,\u201d Schumer said, noting that his own daughter and her wife are expecting a baby next year.  Senate Democrats are quickly moving to pass the bill while the party still controls the House. Republicans won the House majority Wednesday and are unlikely to take up the issue next year.  In a statement after the vote, President Joe Biden said that he sign the bill once it is passed.  \u201cLove is love, and Americans should have the right to marry the person they love,\u201d Biden said.  The bill has gained steady momentum since the Supreme Court\u2019s June decision that overturned Roe v. Wade and the federal right to an abortion. An opinion at that time from Justice Clarence Thomas suggested that an earlier high court decision protecting same-sex marriage could also come under threat. The legislation would repeal the Clinton-era Defense of Marriage Act and require states to recognize all marriages that were legal where they were performed. The new Respect for Marriage Act would also protect interracial marriages by requiring states to recognize legal marriages regardless of \u201csex, race, ethnicity, or national origin.\u201d Congress has been moving to protect same-sex marriage as support from the general public \u2014 and from Republicans in particular \u2014 has sharply grown in recent years, as the Supreme Court\u2019s 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges decision legalized gay marriage nationwide. Recent polling has found more than two-thirds of the public supports same-sex unions. Still, many Republicans in Congress have been reluctant to support the legislation, with many saying it was unnecessary while the marriages are still protected by the courts. Democrats delayed consideration until after the midterm elections, hoping that would relieve political pressure on some GOP senators who might be wavering.  A proposed amendment to the bill, negotiated by supporters to bring more Republicans on board, would clarify that it does not affect rights of private individuals or businesses that are already enshrined in law. Another tweak would make clear that a marriage is between two people, an effort to ward off some far-right criticism that the legislation could endorse polygamy.  Three Republicans said early on that they would support the legislation and have lobbied their GOP colleagues to support it: Maine Sen. Susan Collins, North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis and Ohio Sen. Rob Portman. They argued that there was still value in enshrining the rights for such marriages even if the courts don\u2019t invalidate them.  \u201cCurrent federal law doesn\u2019t reflect the will or beliefs of the American people,\u201d Portman said ahead of the vote. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the Senate to settle the issue.\u201d  In the end, nine of their GOP colleagues joined them in voting for it, bringing the total to twelve and providing enough votes needed to overcome a filibuster in the 50-50 Senate. The other Republicans who voted for the legislation were Sens. Richard Burr of North Carolina, Todd Young of Indiana, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Mitt Romney of Utah, Joni Ernst of Iowa, Roy Blunt of Missouri, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan of Alaska.  The growing GOP support for the issue is a sharp contrast from even a decade ago, when many Republicans vocally opposed same-sex marriages. The legislation passed the House in a July vote with the support of 47 Republicans \u2014 a larger-than-expected number that gave the measure a boost in the Senate.  On Tuesday, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints became the most recent conservative-leaning group to back the legislation. In a statement, the Utah-based faith said church doctrine would continue to consider same-sex relationships to be against God\u2019s commandments, but it would support rights for same-sex couples as long as they didn\u2019t infringe upon religious groups\u2019 right to believe as they choose. Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat who is the first openly gay senator and has been working on gay rights issues for almost four decades, said the newfound openness from many Republicans on the subject reminds her \u201cof the arc of the LBGTQ movement to begin with, in the early days when people weren\u2019t out and people knew gay people by myths and stereotypes.\u201d  Baldwin said that as more individuals and families have become visible, hearts and minds have changed.  \u201cAnd slowly laws have followed,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is history.\u201d  Schumer said the issue is personal to him, as well.  \u201cPassing the Respect for Marriage Act is as personal as it gets for many senators and their staffs, myself included,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cMy daughter and her wife are actually expecting a little baby in February. So it matters a lot to so many of us to get this done.\u201d  ___ Associated Press writer Sam Metz in Salt Lake City contributed to this report. ",

    "LA elects US Rep Karen Bass mayor, first Black woman in post": [
        "By MICHAEL R. BLOODNovember 17, 2022 GMT",
        " LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 U.S. Rep. Karen Bass defeated developer Rick Caruso to become the next mayor of Los Angeles on Wednesday, making her the first Black woman to hold the post as City Hall contends with an out-of-control homeless crisis, rising crime rates and multiple scandals that have shaken trust in government. With more than 70% of the vote tallied, Bass had amassed an insurmountable lead of nearly 47,000 votes. She had 53.1%, with Caruso notching 46.9%. Bass was working in her congressional office in Los Angeles when she was informed by an aide she had won the race. Caruso\u2019s campaign said he was calling the mayor-elect to offer his congratulations. \u201cThe people of Los Angeles have sent a clear message: it is time for change and it is time for urgency,\u201d Bass said in a statement.  \u201cI ran for mayor to urgently confront the crises our hometown faces,\u201d Bass said. \u201cTonight, 40,000 Angelenos will sleep without a home \u2014 and five will not wake up. Crime is increasing and families are being priced out of their neighborhoods. This must change.\u201d  Caruso promised that \u201cthere will be more to come from the movement we built.\u201d  \u201cAs a city we need to unite around\u201d Bass, he said in a statement.  Bass \u2014 a Democrat who was on President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s short list for vice president \u2014 overcame more than $100 million in spending by the billionaire Caruso\u2019s campaign while arguing that she would be a coalition builder who could heal a troubled city of nearly 4 million.  The election tested whether voters in the heavily Democratic city were willing to turn away from their liberal tendencies and embrace an approach that would place a strong emphasis on public safety.  Caruso, a former Republican who became a Democrat shortly before entering the race, had represented a turn to the political right. He argued that Bass and other longtime politicians were part of the problem who led LA into multiple crises. He promised to expand the police department to deal with rising crime rates and quickly get ubiquitous homeless encampments off the streets. Bass, a former state Assembly leader, had the advantage of being a lifelong Democrat in a city where Republicans are almost invisible. She was backed by Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and the Democratic establishment. The election had historical dimensions, as she will become the first woman and second Black person to hold the job, after former Mayor Tom Bradley, who held the post from 1973 to 1993.  She takes office next month as City Council faces a racism scandal that led to the resignation of its former president and calls for the resignation of two more members. More than 40,000 people are homeless, and there is widespread anxiety over crime that has ranged from daytime robberies on city sidewalks to smash-and-grab thefts at luxury stores. Bass has said her first order of business at City Hall will be to declare a state of emergency on homelessness and begin the work of getting thousands of unhoused people out of sagging tent communities and rusted RVs and into shelters.  \u201cWe are in a fight for the soul of our city,\u201d Bass said at an election night rally. \u201cWe are going to build a new Los Angeles.\u201d The winner replaces beleaguered Democrat Eric Garcetti, who will conclude two bumpy terms with his nomination to become U.S. ambassador to India stalled in the Senate \u2014 apparently over sexual misconduct allegations against a former top Garcetti adviser. The race was shaped in large part by Caruso\u2019s lavish spending \u2014 and his unavoidable advertising. City records show his campaign expenses have topped $100 million so far, most of it financed with his own money.  Bass, with just a small fraction of that amount at her disposal, had said \u201cit\u2019s not the power of the money, it\u2019s the power of the people.\u201d Caruso\u2019s focus on unsafe streets had shared some similarity to 1993, when LA voters turned to Republican Richard Riordan to lead the city in the aftermath of the deadly 1992 riots that erupted after four white police officers were acquitted of assault in the beating of Black motorist Rodney King. It also has parallels to New York City in the early 1990s, when the perception that crime was out of control helped usher in Republican Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Los Angeles, however, is much changed from Riordan\u2019s days. It\u2019s more Latino, less white and more solidly Democratic \u2014 Republicans comprise only about 13% of voters, while Democrats account for nearly 60%, with most of the remainder independents who lean Democratic.",

    "US House win by ex-combat pilot cements Republican control": [
        "By MICHAEL R. BLOODNovember 17, 2022 GMT",
        " LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Republican Rep. Mike Garcia, a former Navy fighter pilot, scored a U.S. House win in a strongly Democratic district Wednesday, handing the GOP control of the chamber and giving the party a rare reason to celebrate in a state dominated by Democrats.  The conservative Republican was reelected to a third term in a district that has a 12.5-point Democratic registration edge and was carried by then-presidential candidate Joe Biden by double digits in 2020. It was Garcia\u2019s third consecutive victory over Democrat Christy Smith, a former legislator.  Garcia was first elected in a special election in May 2020, then was reelected two years ago by just 333 votes. He faced an even tougher challenge this year, after his left-leaning district was redrawn and became more solidly Democratic.  With nearly 75% of the ballots counted, Garcia had 54.2%, to 45.8% for Smith. Even though his victory carried historic weight by putting Republicans in charge of the House \u201cthe mission remains the same,\u201d Garcia said in a statement, in which he promised to work to \u201cget our country back on track.\u201d Garcia, who flew over 30 combat missions during Operation Iraqi Freedom, is the sole GOP House member with a district anchored in heavily Democratic Los Angeles County.  It takes 218 seats to control the House. With the addition of the latest California results, Republicans have locked down 218 seats so far with Democrats claiming 211. In another key race in the state, Democratic Rep. Mike Levin beat back a tough challenge from Republican businessman Brian Maryott in a Southern California district that straddles Orange and San Diego counties. With nearly all the votes counted, Levin had 52.65%, to 47.4% for Maryott. Levin said he was eager to return to Washington to continue working on affordable health care, climate change and assistance for veterans. Biden traveled to the district in the election\u2019s closing days in hopes of giving Levin a boost. Garcia\u2019s win, which gave Republicans House control, came with a splash of political sass, arriving in a state so solidly Democratic that a Republican hasn\u2019t won a statewide race since 2006. It is also home to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco. California is known nationally as a liberal monolith, but pockets of conservative strength remain, mainly in the Southern California suburbs and rural and farming stretches. But even with the wins, Republicans will remain a small minority within the state\u2019s congressional delegation.  Of the state\u2019s 52 seats \u2014 the largest delegation in Congress \u2014 GOP candidates had captured just nine as of Wednesday. Counting continued in five districts, although one was a matchup between two Democrats.  Smith, a former legislator, had argued Garcia was out of step with district voters: He was endorsed by then-President Trump in 2020, then joined House Republicans who rejected electoral votes from Arizona and Pennsylvania and opposed Trump\u2019s impeachment after the Capitol insurrection. She also highlighted Garcia\u2019s opposition to abortion rights.  Garcia emphasized his military service and pointed to his vote supporting $2,000 stimulus checks as one example of his political independence. He\u2019s also stressed local issues, including concern over illegal marijuana cultivation. In California, the primary House battlegrounds are Orange County \u2014 a suburban expanse southeast of Los Angeles that was once a GOP stronghold but has become increasingly diverse and Democratic \u2014 and the Central Valley, an inland stretch sometimes called the nation\u2019s salad bowl for its agricultural production. The tightest remaining contest in the state emerged in the Central Valley, where Democrat Adam Gray seized a tissue-thin lead over Republican John Duarte for an open seat in District 13. Underscoring the closeness of the race, Gray\u2019s campaign formed a committee to begin raising money to finance a possible recount. The latest returns showed Gray leading by 600 votes, with nearly 85% of the ballots tabulated. In Orange County, Democratic Rep. Katie Porter was holding a nearly 3-point edge over Republican Scott Baugh in one of the nation\u2019s marquee races. Baugh had slashed her lead in half earlier this week, but Porter, a star of the party\u2019s progressive wing, rebounded. About 90% of the votes had been counted. In the Central Valley\u2019s 22nd District, where about two-thirds of the votes have been counted, Republican Rep. David Valadao, who voted to impeach then-President Donald Trump, had a 5.6-point margin over Democrat Rudy Salas. ___ Follow the AP\u2019s coverage of the 2022 midterm elections at https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections.

    "Facebook still banning Trump \u2014 for now \u2014 despite campaign": [
        "By DAVID KLEPPERNovember 17, 2022 GMT",
        " Donald Trump may be running for president, but he still can\u2019t use Facebook. The social media platform has no plans to reinstate Trump\u2019s account following the former president\u2019s announcement that he will seek a second term in the White House, the company confirmed Wednesday. Trump was kicked off Facebook following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Trump may not have to wait long to get back on the site, however. His suspension from Facebook is set to be reconsidered in January, two years after it was first imposed. One change will be immediate: As a candidate, Trump will no longer be subject to Facebook fact checks. That\u2019s because under Facebook rules, comments by elected officials and candidates for office aren\u2019t subject to fact checks on its site. The Associated Press participates in Facebook\u2019s independent fact-checking program. Throughout his tenure as president, Trump\u2019s use of social media posed a significant challenge to major social media platforms trying to balance the public\u2019s need to hear from their elected leaders with worries about misinformation, harassment and incitement of violence.  Following the Jan. 6 riot, Trump was also kicked off Snapchat, Twitter and Instagram, which is owned by Facebook parent company Meta. Trump\u2019s ability to post videos to his YouTube channel was suspended. YouTube spokeswoman Ivy Choi said Wednesday the company had no plans to lift the suspension.  Twitter\u2019s new owner, Elon Musk, has said he disagreed with the platform\u2019s decision to bar Trump following the Jan. 6 attack. Musk said no announcement about reinstating banned users will be made until a content moderation council has reviewed the issue Twitter did not respond to questions about whether Trump\u2019s candidacy will impact the decision. Since his suspension, Trump has started his own social media platform, TruthSocial, and said he has no plans to rejoin Twitter if allowed. The platforms would be justified if they extend their restrictions on Trump or make them permanent, said Heidi Beirich, founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism and a member of the Real Facebook Oversight Board, a group that has criticized Meta\u2019s response to extremist content and misinformation. \u201cThe big problem is treating candidates as if they\u2019re in a special category and deserve special treatment,\u201d Beirich said. \u201cIf you have a set of rules, it should apply to everyone. The decision shouldn\u2019t be a struggle.\u201d Facebook initially placed a 24-hour suspension on Trump\u2019s account on Jan. 6 after he praised the rioters who stormed the Capitol. Facebook creator and CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced an indefinite suspension on Jan. 7, adding that \u201cthe risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great.\u201d The company\u2019s quasi-independent oversight board upheld the ban but directed Facebook to set a time limit. The ban is now set to expire Jan. 7, 2023.",

    "Leading Republicans try to ignore Trump campaign launch": [
        "By STEVE PEOPLES and BRENDAN FARRINGTONNovember 16, 2022 GMT",
        " TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Leading Republican officials on Wednesday sought to ignore Donald Trump\u2019s formal step into the 2024 presidential contest, insisting there were more pressing priorities as GOP leaders grappled with the fallout of a major midterm disappointment. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said it was much too early for Republicans to focus on the next presidential election when asked about a brewing GOP divide during a news conference the morning after Trump\u2019s announcement. Declining to say the former president\u2019s name, DeSantis, a potential Trump rival in 2024, said he was focused instead on Georgia\u2019s upcoming Senate runoff and his governing priorities in Florida. \u201cWe just finished this election. People need to chill out a little bit on some of this stuff, I mean seriously,\u201d DeSantis said. The 44-year-old Republican governor continued: \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s been a long election, we\u2019ve got the Georgia runoff, but for me it\u2019s like, OK, what more do we need to do to continue to make Florida lead the way? We\u2019re going to be focusing on that.\u201d The sentiment was echoed by leading Republicans across Ohio, New Hampshire and Washington as the GOP grappled with rising internal tensions and questions about its future following a deeply disappointing midterm cycle. History suggested the Republicans should have celebrated massive gains last week, but the sweeping victory party leaders predicted did not materialize as Trump loyalists were defeated across several swing states.  Democrats held the Senate, while Republicans won a razor-thin House majority Wednesday. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine deflected a question about Trump\u2019s announcement at the Republican Governors Association meeting in Orlando on Wednesday.  \u201cIt\u2019s a little early to be commenting on the presidential race,\u201d DeWine said as he walked into a forum on \u201cThe Future of the GOP.\u201d \u201cWe are still trying to analyze what happened a week ago,\u201d said DeWine, who won his reelection by 25 points after refusing to embrace Trump\u2019s lies about the 2020 election.  Trump won\u2019t make it easy for his party to ignore 2024, however, even with the opening contests of the next presidential primary season likely more than a year away. Trump launched his third presidential bid Tuesday night before an audience of several hundred supporters in a chandeliered ballroom at his Mar-a-Lago club. That\u2019s even as the political parties have yet to set their primary voting calendars. \u201cAmerica\u2019s comeback starts right now,\u201d Trump said. The former president, who sparked a deadly insurrection after losing his 2020 reelection bid, hoped to launch his 2024 campaign in the glow of resounding GOP midterm victories. Instead, he entered the race in a moment of deep political vulnerability following a series of stringing losses that many party leaders blamed on him. High-profile Republican candidates for the Senate and governor across Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin who parroted Trump\u2019s baseless conspiracy theories about the 2020 election were defeated.  DeSantis, meanwhile, won his reelection by nearly 20 points in what has historically been a swing state. With party activists openly encouraging DeSantis to seek the presidency, Trump has been increasingly critical of the Florida governor in recent weeks \u2014 even unveiling a new nickname: Ron DeSanctimonious.  Asked about Trump\u2019s barbs on Monday, DeSantis quipped, \u201cCheck out the scoreboard.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, increasingly a Trump critic, declined to weigh in on the early 2024 debate when asked, although he acknowledged that the GOP \u201cturned off a lot of these centrist voters\u201d in the 2022 midterms. \u201cThe way I\u2019m gonna go into this presidential primary season is to stay out of it. I don\u2019t have a dog in that fight,\u201d McConnell said.  On the other side of the Capitol, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Trump loyalist who hopes to become the House speaker should the GOP seize that chamber\u2019s majority, walked away from reporters on Wednesday when asked whether he would support Trump\u2019s 2024 bid. Still, a handful of Republican elected officials have already endorsed Trump\u2019s nascent campaign \u2014 House Republican Conference Chair, Rep. Elisa Stefanik, R-N.Y., and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., among them.  In New Hampshire, which is in line to host GOP\u2019s opening presidential primary election in 2024, Gov. Chris Sununu predicted that few would pay attention to Trump\u2019s announcement in the short term.  \u201cHe won\u2019t clear the field,\u201d Sununu told Fox News, declining to rule out a 2024 presidential run of his own.  Sununu, a Republican, won his reelection by more than 15 points after pushing back against Trump\u2019s election lies. At the same time, New Hampshire Republican Senate candidate Don Bolduc, a Trump loyalist, lost by 9 points. \u201cYou could make the argument he\u2019s never been weaker politically,\u201d Sununu said of Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s really an announcement from a defensive position. Therefore, I think it\u2019s going to make a little bit of news and we\u2019re all going to move on. There\u2019s still going to be a lot of folks that enter this race \u2014 probably not until late \u201923.\u201d Conservative media has also been cool to Trump\u2019s 2024 political ambitions.  The New York Post, one of Trump\u2019s favorite hometown newspapers, marked Trump\u2019s campaign launch with only this line on the very bottom of the front page: \u201cFlorida man makes announcement.\u201d ___ Peoples reported from New York.

And that\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be,\u201d Biden said in remarks days before the Nov. 8 elections. \u201cBut there is something else at stake: democracy itself.\u201d The election results reveal both the potential and the problems with Biden\u2019s argument for motivating voters. In states such as Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania, voters could look at their ballots and see a clear contrast between Democrats and Republican candidates who falsely claimed the 2020 presidential race was rigged.  And yet, the notion of democracy is open to interpretation, one that encompasses feelings about one\u2019s own identity, political rivals, the news media and broader social changes. Democrats held the Senate, while Republicans won control of the House Wednesday.  Biden\u2019s message resonated with many Democratic voters, AP VoteCast shows, and maybe even helped Democrats to defy gravity in key states in the midterms, which historically have resulted in major losses for the party that holds the White House.  But the nationwide survey of more than 90,000 voters also shows many Republicans similarly considered the future of democracy to be their motivating factor this year, and Democratic candidates didn\u2019t exclusively win the democracy vote. Overall, VoteCast reveals Democratic voters were much more likely than Republicans to call the future of democracy their \u201csingle most important\u201d factor in voting, with more than half of Democrats saying so. Still, about a third of Republicans identified democracy as their top consideration. Across the country, Democratic congressional candidates won roughly 6 in 10 voters who said the future of democracy was their \u201csingle most important\u201d factor, while about 4 in 10 backed Republican candidates. That gap appears to have been critical in some of the most competitive races for U.S. Senate and governor this year, setting up a stronger than expected performance by Democrats. In Pennsylvania, Democrats John Fetterman and Josh Shapiro appeared to outperform Democratic House candidates nationwide, earning about two-thirds of the \u201cdemocracy vote.\u201d  Shapiro bested for governor Republican Doug Mastriano, who commissioned buses for people to attend the rally that preceded the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol. Fetterman flipped an open Senate seat against Republican Mehmet Oz, who won a rough GOP primary in large part because of former President Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement. Biden made Pennsylvania the epicenter of his midterms push, going there 11 times this year, more than any state other than his home of Delaware. The president gave a Sept. 1 speech in front of Philadelphia\u2019s Independence Hall where he said \u201cequality and democracy were under assault.\u201d He said the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters \u201cput a dagger to the throat of our democracy\u201d by trying to prevent the peaceful transfer of power. Also getting about two-thirds of the \u201cdemocracy vote\u201d were Democrats Mark Kelly and Katie Hobbs in Arizona. Running for governor, Hobbs beat Republican Kari Lake, a former local TV news anchor who embraced Trump\u2019s denial that he lost his reelection bid two years ago.  Arizona Republican Senate candidate Blake Masters had language on his website that claimed the 2020 election was stolen, but he removed it after winning the primary and lost to the incumbent Kelly. In Michigan, too, where Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer outpaced Republican Tudor Dixon by about two to one among those who considered democracy their chief consideration. The democratic issue also dovetailed with the Supreme Court decisions that overturned Roe v. Wade and returned the issue to the states. In his speeches about democracy, Biden specifically cited abortion bans as a policy goal of Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement. Michigan had a ballot issue to preserve access to abortions. About 3 in 4 voters called the Roe reversal an important factor in their vote. Of that group, two-thirds supported Whitmer.  But in other battleground states where Republican candidates edged out Democrats and in solidly red states the democracy vote wasn\u2019t as clearly a Democratic vote. GOP candidates were able to draw about even with \u2014 or even edge ahead of \u2014 Democratic ones among those voters who said democracy was their top consideration. In red-state Kansas, where Republican Sen. Jerry Moran and Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly both won reelection bids, the democracy vote responded differently to the two candidates. In the Senate race, voters who singularly prioritized democracy slightly preferred Moran over his Democratic challenger Mark Holland. But Kelly won about 6 in 10 of them in the governor\u2019s race. Meanwhile, Republicans had a strong showing in both Florida and in Texas, and VoteCast shows they earned  more of the democracy vote than GOP congressional candidates nationwide. Close to half of voters who said the future of democracy was their top factor voted for Sen. Marco Rubio and Gov. Ron DeSantis in Florida, and for Gov. Greg Abbott in Texas. In Ohio, democracy voters clearly favored Gov. Mike DeWine, who won his reelection by a wider margin than JD Vance, the Republican winner in the race for Senate. In the Senate race, those who said democracy was their chief consideration went for the Democratic candidate, Rep. Tim Ryan. Candidates on both sides of the aisle earned the backing of these voters because Republicans and Democrats have very different things in mind when they said the future of the nation\u2019s democracy was their single most important factor. Compared with other Republicans and with democracy Democrats, democracy Republicans nationwide were especially likely to be \u201cangry\u201d with the way the federal government is working and to say their vote was intended to express support for Trump; about half of democracy Republicans said each. About 7 in 10 democracy Republicans identify as supporters of the MAGA, movement, and about as many said Biden was not legitimately elected president in 2020. About half said they were not confident that midterm votes would be counted accurately. Meanwhile, about two-thirds of democracy Democrats said the Supreme Court overturning Roe made them \u201cangry,\u201d more than the percentage of other Democrats or democracy Republicans who said that. About three-quarters of democracy Democrats said they meant their vote as an expression of opposition to Trump; about 6 in 10 said their vote was intended to support Biden. Many Democratic voters didn\u2019t let their reservations about Biden keep them from supporting the president\u2019s party, a sign that the issues at stake might have mattered as much as who was in the White House. Just 43% of voters approved of Biden\u2019s leadership, while 57% disapproved. Among voters who backed Democratic House candidates, 18% disapproved of the president. ___ Follow the AP\u2019s coverage of the 2022 midterm elections at https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections.

    "Faith groups split over bill to protect same-sex marriage": [
        "By DAVID CRARYNovember 16, 2022 GMT",
        " Among U.S. faith leaders and denominations, there are sharp differences over the bill advancing in the Senate that would protect same-sex and interracial marriages in federal law.  The measure, a high priority for congressional Democrats, won a key test vote Wednesday when 12 Senate Republicans joined all Democrats to forward the bill for a final vote in the coming days. At least 10 GOP senators were needed for that to happen. On Tuesday, one of the most prominent conservative-leaning denominations -- The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints -- came out in favor of the legislation. But the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention remain opposed, saying the bill \u2013 even with a newly added amendment aimed at attracting Republican support \u2013 is a dire threat to religious liberty.  A paramount concern for these leaders of the country\u2019s two largest denominations is that even the updated bill would not protect religious schools or faith-based nonprofits such as adoption and foster care providers.  The bill \u201cis an intentional attack on the religious freedom of millions of Americans with sincerely held beliefs about marriage, based on dictates of faith in God,\u201d leaders of the Missouri Baptist Convention, an SBC affiliate, said in a letter this week to U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican. The letter failed to sway Blunt; he voted for the bill. Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York, chairman of the Catholic bishops\u2019 Committee for Religious Liberty, dismissed the bipartisan amendment as failing even the \u201cmeager goal\u201d of preserving the status quo in balancing religious freedom with the right to same-sex marriage.  \u201cThe bill will be a new arrow in the quiver of those who wish to deny religious organizations\u2019 liberty to freely exercise their religious duties, strip them of their tax exemptions, or exclude them from full participation in the public arena,\u201d Dolan said earlier this week.  Meanwhile, many left-of-center faith leaders are cheering the bill, including some who planned a Thursday morning rally at the U.S. Capitol. Rally sponsors include the Interfaith Alliance, the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, the United Church of Christ Justice and Local Church Ministries and Hindus for Human Rights. \u201cThis is common sense legislation which provides religious liberty for all and not just a few,\u201d said Tarunjit Singh Butalia, executive director of Religions for Peace USA. \u201cFaith communities need to work on living out the principles of marriage enshrined in their own faith without imposing their religious views on people of other faiths and no faith.\u201d The bill won approval in the House in July. A final Senate vote is expected soon, and the measure \u2014 if approved \u2014 would then return to the House for consideration of Senate changes. The bill has gained steady momentum since the Supreme Court\u2019s June decision that overturned Roe v. Wade and the federal right to abortion. An opinion at that time from Justice Clarence Thomas suggested that an earlier high court decision protecting same-sex marriage could also come under threat.  Rachel Laser, president of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, noted the court opinions in her statement lauding Wednesday\u2019s vote. She called the legislation a \u201cvital step in our nation\u2019s march toward freedom without favor and equality without exception.\u201d  The legislation included a proposed Senate amendment, designed to bring more Republicans on board, clarifying that it does not affect rights of private individuals or businesses that are already enshrined in law. Another tweak would make clear that a marriage is between two people, an effort to ward off some far-right criticism that the legislation could endorse polygamy.  However, numerous conservative faith leaders scoffed at the changes.  \u201cThe new amended Senate bill\u2014the \u2018commonsense\u2019 bill that \u2018protects Americans\u2019 religious liberties\u2019\u2014actually does no such thing,\u201d wrote the Rev. Al Mohler Jr., president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, in an opinion piece. \u201cWhat is left wide open is the threat to ministries such as Christian orphanages and children\u2019s care as well as adoption ministries and foster care.\u201d  The head of the Southern Baptist\u2019s public policy arm, Brent Leatherwood of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, faulted the bill\u2019s Senate backers for pushing legislation \u201cthat will only divide us.\u201d  \u201cWe oppose this bill because marriage is an institution created by God, one with a very specific design: A union between one man and one woman for life,\u201d Leatherwood said via email. Pastor Jack Hibbs who leads Calvary Chapel Chino Hills, an evangelical megachurch in Southern California, said the legislation \u201ccreates an atmosphere of great disrespect for marriage.\u201d \u201cWe have seen this in recent years, for example, regarding businesses that provide services for weddings, from wedding venues to bakeries and florists,\u201d he said, adding that nonprofits could be sued \u201cbecause of their personal and foundational convictions, which should be protected by the First Amendment.\u201d San Francisco Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone, chairman of the Catholic bishops\u2019 Committee on Laity, Marriage, Family Life, and Youth, said the bill provided inadequate religious protections. \u201cI object to language like exceptions, because it means that we\u2019re allowed a pass to discriminate,\u201d he said in an interview Wednesday. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what we\u2019re doing at all. We\u2019re affirming that children need a mother and a father.\u201d He acknowledged that leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints \u201cseem to be moving in a different direction\u201d regarding same-sex marriage. \u201cBut they\u2019ve been very, very strong partners with us in trying to keep the focus on the the need to preserve the family.\u201d  In its statement Tuesday, the Utah-based LDS said church doctrine would continue to consider same-sex relationships to be against God\u2019s commandments, but that it would support rights for same-sex couples as long as they didn\u2019t infringe upon religious groups\u2019 right to believe as they choose.  Among the faith leaders urging passage of the bill was the Rev. Paul Brandeis Raushenbush, an American Baptist pastor who is president of Interfaith Alliance and is part of a same-sex marriage.  \u201dThere is a misconception that faith and LGBTQ+ equality are fundamentally incompatible,\u201d he wrote in an opinion piece carried Wednesday by Religion News Service.  \u201cAs a religious leader, I regard this historic legislation as an important contribution to America\u2019s religious freedom,\u201d he wrote. \u201dMore immediately, I am not willing to leave the status of the marriages I\u2019ve performed or my own to chance.\u201d __ AP Religion Team journalists Holly Meyer, Peter Smith, Deepa Bharath and Luis Andres Henao contributed to this report. \u2014- Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP\u2019s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

    "Russia didn\u2019t take US phone call after Poland missile strike": [
        "By TARA COPP and LOLITA C. BALDORNovember 16, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The top U.S. military officer said Wednesday that he tried to reach out to his Russian counterpart in the aftermath of the missile explosions in Poland, but wasn\u2019t able to get through. Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said his staff tried to get Russia\u2019s top-ranking military official Gen. Valery Gerasimov on the phone to discuss the incident with \u201cno success.\u201d Milley didn\u2019t elaborate on the efforts, but the lack of communications raises concerns about high-level U.S.-Russian communications in a crisis. A strike against Poland, a NATO member, could have risked a larger conflict if it turned out that Russia had launched the strike.  The U.S. and other top leaders now say they believe the strike was probably launched by Ukrainian air defenses to defend against a Russian missile bombardment. But uncertainty swirled for hours. Several U.S. defense officials said it isn\u2019t unusual for Gerasimov to not be available for a call.  The lack of communication is worrisome, especially given the potential implications of the strike, said John Tierney, executive director of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation in Washington.  Open lines of communication \u201care vital if we are to avoid the risk of conflict caused by misconception, miscalculations or mistake,\u201d Tierney said. \u201cIt is unsettling to learn from General Milley that his counterpart was unreachable or not willing to engage when an explosion occurred in Poland.\u201d  Milley did talk to his military counterparts in Ukraine and Poland as the governments worked quickly to assess whether the missile that killed two people in Poland had been launched by Russia or Ukraine.  The conversation came as Milley has said that Russia\u2019s recent defeat in the key southern city Kherson and the possible slowdown of military operations in the winter could provide an opportunity to negotiate.  \u201cYou want to negotiate at a time when you\u2019re at your strength, and your opponent is at weakness,\u201d Milley said at a Pentagon briefing Wednesday. \u201cThe Russian military is suffering tremendously,\u201d he said, citing large losses of Russian tanks, fighting vehicles, fighter jets and helicopters.  If fighting slows down, Milley said that may become \u201ca window\u201d for talks about a political solution.  Both he and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said that they expect Ukraine to keep fighting through the winter, and the U.S. and its allies will continue to provide more support and weapons. And it will be up to Ukraine to determine any negotiation plans. \u201cWe\u2019ve said repeatedly that the Ukrainians are going to decide that and not us. And we will support them for as long as it takes,\u201d said Austin, who was also at the briefing. The missile that landed in Poland Tuesday was launched during the \u201clargest wave of missiles that we\u2019ve seen since the beginning of the war,\u201d Austin said. On Tuesday Russia launched as many as 100 missiles at Ukraine as Moscow intensifies its airstrikes following significant ground losses.  Milley said it\u2019s unlikely that either side can gain a military victory quickly. He said the chance of Russia, which currently controls about 20% of Ukraine, overrunning the entire country \u201cis close to zero.\u201d And, he added, the \u201ctask of militarily kicking the Russians physically out of Ukraine is a very difficult task. And it\u2019s not going to happen in the next couple of weeks unless the Russian army completely collapses, which is unlikely.\u201d",

    "Trump criminal probes will proceed \u2014 even as he\u2019s candidate": [
        "By ERIC TUCKERNovember 16, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump\u2019s early announcement of his third White House bid won\u2019t shield the former president from the criminal investigations already confronting him as an ordinary citizen, leaving him legally and politically exposed as he seeks the 2024 Republican nomination. The Justice Department is pushing ahead with its probes. And with the midterm elections now mostly complete and the 2024 presidential campaign months away from beginning in earnest, federal prosecutors have plenty of time to continue their work even as Trump hits the campaign trail. \u201cI don\u2019t think the department is going to hesitate as a result of Trump nominating himself and anointing himself as the first candidate in the 2024 election,\u201d said former Justice Department prosecutor Michael Weinstein. \u201cI just think they will see that as him trying to game the system as he\u2019s done very successfully in the courts,\u201d and they\u2019re prepared for his \u201cblowback.\u201d Trump enters the race facing federal investigations related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results and into the hoarding of top-secret government documents at his Florida estate \u2014 plus a separate s tate probe in Georgia. The Mar-a-Lago investigation has advanced especially swiftly, with prosecutors this month giving a close Trump ally immunity to secure his testimony before a federal grand jury. Justice Department lawyers in that probe say they have amassed evidence of potential crimes involving not only obstruction but also the willful retention of national defense information. It remains unclear if anyone will be charged, as does the timetable for a decision. But former officials say the best way to ensure the outcome is seen as above reproach is to conduct a by-the-book investigation showing no special favor or ill treatment because of Trump\u2019s former high office. \u201cThe public will have the most faith in what you\u2019re doing, and you will get the most successful results, if you treat Donald Trump like any other American,\u201d said Matthew Miller, who served as Justice Department spokesman under former Attorney General Eric Holder. Current Attorney General Merrick Garland has suggested as much, saying last summer in response to questions about Trump and the Jan. 6 investigation that \u201cno person is above the law.\u201d Asked in a July television interview how a potential Trump candidacy might affect the department, Garland replied: \u201cWe will hold accountable anyone who is criminally responsible for attempting to interfere with the transfer \u2014 legitimate, lawful transfer \u2014 of power from one administration to the next.\u201d Investigating any elected official, or candidate for office, almost always invites political speculation. Justice Department protocol cautions prosecutors against taking overt action in the direct run-up to an election, but that\u2019s more a standard convention than a hard-and-fast rule. And the 2024 presidential contest is two years away. Still, it\u2019s not easy to investigate a former president or current candidate. That\u2019s especially true in the case of Trump, who spent his presidency assailing his own Justice Department and haranguing attorneys general he himself had appointed. He has already lambasted the FBI for searching Mar-a-Lago in August, using the episode to raise funds from supporters. Now, with his candidacy official, he and his supporters will try to reframe the narrative of the investigation as political persecution by a Democratic administration that fears him for 2024. In fact, one risk for Democrats is that Trump \u2014 who during his announcement Tuesday declared himself \u201ca victim\u201d \u2014 could galvanize his supporters anew with that argument. On the other hand, the results of last week\u2019s midterm elections suggest he may be more politically vulnerable than many had thought, including in his Republican Party. What about past investigations of a presidential candidate? There is a recent precedent, though under different circumstances. In 2016, the Obama administration\u2019s Justice Department investigated Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton over her use of a private email server as secretary of state. Despite the efforts of the law enforcement officials who worked the investigation to remain above the fray, the probe became repeatedly mired in presidential politics \u2014 in ways that may not have been foreseen when it began. Then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch expressed regret over a chance encounter she had with Bill Clinton in the final days of the investigation. Former FBI Director James Comey was blamed for harming Clinton\u2019s candidacy by making a detailed public explanation of why the bureau was not recommending charges and then for reopening the probe 11 days before the election. David Laufman, who supervised that investigation for the Justice Department as chief of the same section now running the Mar-a-Lago probe, said there\u2019s a \u201csurreal disconnect\u201d between the political maelstrom that accompanies politically freighted investigations and the heads-down mentality of a prosecutor determined to just do the work. \u201cHere we were, conducting a criminal investigation with national security undertones in a way that was practically splashed on the front page of every newspaper every fricking day,\u201d Laufman said. \u201cAnd all we could do was to continue to do what we knew had to be done \u2014 to obtain all the relevant facts needed to make judgments about whether it was appropriate to recommend criminal charges.\u201d He said he believed the investigators working Mar-a-Lago have been the same way, praising their professionalism amid pressure from the public and even concerns about their personal safety. In the Clinton case, Comey has said he considered recommending a separate special counsel to direct the investigation, though he ultimately did not. The option of a specially appointed prosecutor who would report to Garland exists here as well, just as the Trump-era Justice Department appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller to lead the investigation into potential coordination between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia.  It\u2019s not clear how seriously Garland would consider that. A department spokesman declined to comment. Politics aside, in making the decision whether to bring an indictment, much will ultimately depend on the strength of the Justice Department\u2019s case. \u201cIf the government\u2019s case is exceptionally strong, I think the rule of law will have a predominant weight in the attorney general\u2019s calculus,\u201d Laufman said. ____ Follow Eric Tucker at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP ___ More on Donald Trump-related investigations: https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump",

    "Storming Capitol was \u2018really stupid,\u2019 Oath Keeper testifies": [
        "By MICHAEL KUNZELMANNovember 16, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A former Ohio bar owner who stormed the U.S. Capitol in a military-style stack formation with fellow members of the far-right Oath Keepers extremist group told jurors Wednesday that it was a \u201creally stupid\u201d decision, saying she got swept up in what seemed to be a \u201cvery American moment.\u201d  In a decision that surprised even the judge, Jessica Watkins took the the stand to testify in her defense as the high-stakes seditious conspiracy case against her, Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes and three others nears a close.  Watkins, an Army veteran who has been locked up since her arrest nearly two years ago, testified that she never intended to interfere with Congress\u2019 certification of President Joe Biden\u2019s electoral victory and never heard any commands for her and other Oath Keepers to enter the building on Jan. 6, 2021.  Watkins recalled consuming a \u201csteady diet\u201d of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones\u2019 \u201cInfowars\u201d show, which pushed the lie that the 2020 election was stolen. She called herself \u201cjust another idiot\u201d in the mob on Jan. 6 and likened the scene outside the Capitol \u2014 where rioters smashed windows and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with police \u2014 to a Black Friday sale. \u201cAre you proud of what you did?\u201d her attorney, Jonathan Crisp, asked. \u201cNot anymore,\u201d Watkins replied. Watkins, of Woodstock, Ohio, is the third defendant in the more than monthlong trial to take the witness stand \u2014 a move generally considered by defense lawyers as a last-resort option as it opens defendants up to intense cross-examination by prosecutors and often does more harm than good. Prosecutors will get a chance to question Watkins on Thursday.  Watkins took the stand in the seventh week of testimony in the case accusing Rhodes, Watkins and three others of a violent plot to stop the transfer of presidential power. Closing arguments could happen as early as this week.  Jurors have heard how Watkins before the riot was messaging with people who expressed interest in joining her Ohio militia group about \u201cmilitary-style basic\u201d training planned for early January. She told one recruit: \u201cI need you fighting fit\u201d by the inauguration, which was Jan. 20, 2021. They have seen video of Watkins and other Oath Keepers shouldering through the angry pro-Trump mob and into the building in what prosecutors have described as military-style stack formation. They have also heard a recording of a channel called \u201cStop the Steal J6\u201d on the walkie-talkie app Zello that Watkins used to communicate with others during the riot.  \u201cWe are in the mezzanine. We are in the main dome right now. We are rocking it. They are throwing grenades, they are fricking shooting people with paint balls. But we are in here,\u201d Watkins said in the recording.  \u201cGet it, Jess. ... Everything we (expletive) trained for,\u201d someone responded. The defense has spent weeks hammering prosecutors\u2019 lack of evidence of an explicit plan for the Oath Keepers to attack the Capitol before Jan. 6.  Rhodes, a former Army paratrooper and Yale Law School graduate from Granbury, Texas, told jurors that there was never a plan to attack the Capitol. He testified that he was surprised and upset when he learned that some group members had joined a pro-Trump mob in storming the building and that their only mission that day was to provide security for Trump ally Roger Stone and others at events before the rally.  Thomas Caldwell, another defendant whose trial testimony ended earlier on Wednesday, told jurors he wasn\u2019t serious when he floated the idea in messages before the riot of getting a boat that could ferry \u201cheavy weapons\u201d across the Potomac River into Oath Keepers\u2019 \u201cwaiting arms.\u201d Caldwell, a retired U.S. Navy intelligence officer from Berryville, Virginia, described it as \u201ccreative writing.\u201d  Watkins\u2019 lawyer told jurors during opening statements last month that she is a transgender woman who served as an Army Ranger but was discharged early \u2014 a decision that has \u201chaunted her for the duration of her life.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s never felt like she fit in,\u201d Crisp said. \u201cA lot of the things she did that day were to try and fit in.\u201d Watkins told jurors that she struggled with her gender identity since she was a young child but kept it from her parents for years given her strict Christian upbringing. She described being confronted after a deployment to Afghanistan by a fellow soldier who borrowed her laptop and saw evidence of her contact with a support group for transgender people.  \u201cI just panicked. Freaked out,\u201d she said. \u201cI panicked and went AWOL. I ran.\u201d  Watkins said she went AWOL for about two months, spending time in Alaska before receiving an \u201cother than honorable\u201d discharge. She came out to her parents, who she said told her \u201cnever to come home again.\u201d Watkins said she reconciled with her parents roughly 15 years later, and they welcomed her back home. Her fianc\u00e9, Montana Siniff, testified earlier this month that Watkins\u2019 2003 discharge came after she was hazed on a deployment. \u201cShe was hazed to the point on one of her deployments that she absolutely feared for her life,\u201d he told jurors. Watkins\u2019 attorney didn\u2019t signal before Wednesday that she planned to testify. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta appeared frustrated that the court wasn\u2019t given a heads-up, telling Watkins\u2019 lawyer \u201cit would have been nice to know this\u201d before he told jurors earlier in the day that they may get the case by Friday.

    "Feds, tech fall short on watching extremists, Senate says": [
        "By DAVID KLEPPERNovember 16, 2022 GMT",
        " The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security are failing to adequately monitor domestic extremists, according to a new Senate report that also faulted social media platforms for encouraging the spread of violent and antigovernment content. The report, issued Wednesday by the Senate Homeland Security panel, called on federal law enforcement to reassess its overall response to the threat of homegrown terrorism and extremism. The report recommends creating new definitions for extremism that are shared between agencies, improved reporting on crimes linked to white supremacy and antigovernment groups, and better use of social media in an effort to prevent violence, said Sen. Gary Peters, the Michigan Democrat who chairs the committee. Growing domestic extremism has been linked to the country\u2019s widening political divide and a rise in distrust of institutions. Critics of social media\u2019s role in radicalizing extremists say that misinformation and hate speech spread online is fueling the problem, and in some cases encouraging acts of real-world violence like the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Participants in that effort to illegally stop the certification of the presidential election openly discussed online their plans to come to Washington for weeks ahead of time, with some discussing the possibility of using force, Peters noted. \u201cFolks who were looking at what was happening on social media should have known that something very bad could potentially go down on Jan. 6 here at the Capitol,\u201d Peters said Wednesday on a conference call with reporters. The FBI emailed a statement to The Associated Press defending its handling of domestic terrorism in response to the report. The agency has provided comprehensive reports to Congress on the threat of domestic extremism motivated by racism or antigovernment views and tracks it carefully, the agency said. \u201cThey are among the FBI\u2019s top threat priorities,\u201d the agency said. A DHS spokesperson responded similarly Wednesday, saying the agency uses a \u201ccommunity-based approach to prevent terrorism and targeted violence, and does so in ways that protect privacy, civil rights and civil liberties.\u201d The leaders of both agencies are scheduled to testify before Peters\u2019 committee on Thursday, part of its annual hearing on domestic threats. Both agencies have previously defended their work to combat domestic terrorism, as FBI Director Christopher Wray did last year when he told Congress that violent extremists pose a mounting threat. Efforts by federal law enforcement to use social media to track domestic extremism have prompted questions about civil liberties and the targeting of communities of color. Republicans have accused tech platforms, meanwhile, of using content moderation to censor conservative opinions. Facebook, Twitter, TikTok and YouTube were all singled out in the report for encouraging harmful content by using algorithms designed to increase user engagement. Those algorithms often prioritize clicks over quality, potentially sending users down a rabbit hole of increasingly provocative material. The report noted that tech companies often use content moderation tools to remove or flag extremist content after it\u2019s already spread. They should change their algorithms and products to ensure they aren\u2019t encouraging the content in the first place, the report recommended. \u201cThe rise in domestic terrorism can be partially attributed to the proliferation of extremist content on social media platforms and the failure of companies to effectively limit it in favor of action that increase engagement on their platforms,\u201d the report concluded.",

    "Judge delays end of asylum restrictions to late December": [
        "By ELLIOT SPAGATNovember 16, 2022 GMT",
        " SAN DIEGO (AP) \u2014 A federal judge on Wednesday granted the Biden administration a five-week delay to end far-reaching asylum restrictions, writing in upper-case letters that he was doing so \u201cWITH GREAT RELUCTANCE.\u201d U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan acknowledged in his brief order that attorneys for asylum-seeking families didn\u2019t object to the delay and that the administration wasn\u2019t challenging his decision, just asking for time to prepare. The Trump-era policy denying migrants rights under U.S. and international law to request asylum on public-health grounds of preventing spread of COVID-19 is now set to end Dec. 21. Sullivan ruled in Washington on Tuesday that enforcement must end immediately for families and single adults, calling the ban \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d The administration has not applied it to children traveling alone.  Within hours, the Justice Department asked the judge to let the order take effect Dec. 21, giving it five weeks to prepare. Plaintiffs including the American Civil Liberties Union didn\u2019t oppose the delay. \u201cThis transition period is critical to ensuring that (the Department of Homeland Security) can continue to carry out its mission to secure the Nation\u2019s borders and to conduct its border operations in an orderly fashion,\u201d government attorneys wrote. Sullivan, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, wrote in a 49-page ruling that authorities failed to consider the impact on migrants and possible alternatives. The ruling appears to conflict with another in May by a federal judge in Louisiana that kept the restrictions. ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt said Sullivan\u2019s order renders the Louisiana ruling moot. If Sullivan\u2019s ruling stands, it would upend border enforcement. Migrants have been expelled from the United States more than 2.4 million times since the rule took effect in March 2020. The practice was authorized under Title 42 of a broader 1944 law covering public health. Before the judge in Louisiana kept the ban in place in May, U.S. officials said they were planning for as many as 18,000 migrants a day under the most challenging scenario, a staggering number. In May, migrants were stopped an average of 7,800 times a day, the highest of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency.  Immigration advocacy groups have pressed hard to end Title 42, but more moderate Democrats, including U.S. Sens. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Raphael Warnock of Georgia, wanted it to stay when the administration tried to lift it in May. The ban has been unevenly enforced by nationality, falling largely on migrants from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador \u2014 in addition to Mexicans \u2014 because Mexico allows them to be returned from the United States. Last month, Mexico began accepting Venezuelans who are expelled from the United States under Title 42, causing a sharp drop in Venezuelans seeking asylum at the U.S. border. Nationalities that are less likely to be subject to Title 42 have become a growing presence at the border, confident they will be released in the United States to pursue their immigration cases. In October, Cubans were the second-largest nationality at the border after Mexicans, followed by Venezuelans and Nicaraguans. The Homeland Security Department said Wednesday that it would use the next five weeks to \u201cprepare for an orderly transition to new policies at the border.\u201d \u201cWe continue to work with countries throughout the Western Hemisphere to take enforcement actions against the smuggling networks that entice migrants to take the dangerous and often deadly journey to our land borders and to address the root causes of irregular migration that are challenging our hemisphere as a whole,\u201d the department said.",

    "Michelle Obama opens tour for new book, \u2018The Light We Carry\u2019": [
        "By DARLENE SUPERVILLENovember 16, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Michelle Obama says it helps to focus on what you can control when you feel out of control.  Among the things she could control during the death and isolation of the pandemic, the racial unrest and threats to democracy were her spools of yarn and her knitting needles. She labels such thinking the \u201cpower of small,\u201d and she writes in her new book, \u201cThe Light We Carry: Overcoming in Uncertain Times,\u201d that by focusing on a small task like knitting she was able to get through the worry, anxiety and stress of the past few unsettling years.  \u201cThe interesting thing about knitting and using your hands and making something is that it is meditative,\u201d the former first lady said Tuesday night at the Warner Theater in Washington, where she kicked off a monthlong, six-city publicity tour to promote the book. \u201cIn so many ways, it is like a faith,\u201d she said, seated on stage with a friend, former daytime talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres, who engaged Mrs. Obama in nearly 90 minutes of often humorous conversation. \u201cIt\u2019s a thing that shuts your worrying mind and lets your hands take over.\u201d  And therein lies the power, she said.  \u201cI think about the knit and the purl, and the knit and the purl, and a row and a row and a row,\u201d the former first lady said, naming different stitches and techniques used in knitting. \u201cAnd if you keep it up, and you\u2019re focused, you have a sweater.\u201d  In the book, published Tuesday, she shares the contents of her \u201cpersonal toolbox\u201d \u2014 the habits and practices, attitudes and beliefs, and even physical objects that she uses to overcome her feelings of fear, helplessness and self doubt.  \u201cThis book is meant to show you what I keep there and why, what I use professionally and personally to help me stay balanced and confident, what keeps me moving forward even during times of high anxiety and stress,\u201d she wrote in the introduction. The 58-year-old wife of former President Barack Obama and mother of adult daughters Malia and Sasha wrote that the book, her third, is not a how-to manual, but rather is a \u201cseries of honest reflections on what my life has taught me so far.\u201d \u201cKeep in mind, too, that everything I know, all the various tools I lean on, have come to me only through trial and error, over years of constant practice and reevaluation,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI spent decades learning on my feet, making mistakes, adjustments, and course corrections as I went. I\u2019ve progressed only slowly to where I am today.\u201d  \u201cThe Light We Carry\u201d is Mrs. Obama\u2019s first new work since the 2018 release of her bestselling memoir, \u201cBecoming,\u201d which has sold more than 17 million copies worldwide, by far the most popular book by a previous first lady or modern president, including her husband.  As first lady, she wrote \u201cAmerican Grown,\u201d a book about the produce garden she had planted at the White House in 2009.  Mrs. Obama opened the tour in Washington and has events planned at Philadelphia\u2019s The Met, Atlanta\u2019s Fox Theatre, the Chicago Theatre and San Francisco\u2019s Masonic before the tour closes at the YouTube Theater in Los Angeles. Seated in a plush purple chair on stage at the nearly 100-year-old Washington theater, Mrs. Obama discussed her feelings after the 2016 election in which her husband was succeeded by Donald Trump. Coincidentally, Trump announced a third run for president during her appearance.  \u201cIf you guys recall, I said, \u2018Don\u2019t vote for this guy,\u2019\u201d she said, meaning Trump, who sought to undo much of Obama\u2019s record as president. \u201cIt hurt because you wonder \u2014 was it a rebuke of the eight years, the sacrifice we made? Was it complacency? What was it?\u201d The former first lady also discussed overcoming her fear of change and coming to the realization that she could not stand in the way of her husband\u2019s desire to run for president in 2008. He had given her veto power over his decision.  \u201cOpportunity is on the other side of that,\u201d she said, speaking of fear.  She also talked about the pandemic, saying her family handled it better than most because they were already used to isolation from the eight years they lived in the White House \u201cbubble.\u201d  She spoke about how hard it was as first lady \u2014 and still is \u2014 to make new friends she can trust, and how fun it is to watch her daughters \u201cadult\u201d as they share an apartment in California. The girls had returned to Washington to live with their parents during the pandemic. Sasha had completed one semester at the University of Michigan before she came back home. Malia, who was enrolled at Harvard, spent her senior year at home and ended up missing out on a graduation ceremony because of COVID-19. So her parents staged a ceremony in their backyard, complete with commencement speakers.  \u201cIt was me, and Barack,\u201d Mrs. Obama said, laughing. \u201cWe told her how lucky she was. She got us both.\u201d",

    "Trump seeks White House again amid GOP losses, legal probes": [
        "By JILL COLVINNovember 16, 2022 GMT",
        " PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday launched his third campaign for the White House just one week after a disappointing midterm showing for Republicans, forcing the party to again decide whether to embrace a candidate whose refusal to accept defeat in 2020 sparked an insurrection and pushed American democracy to the brink. \u201cIn order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for president of the United States,\u201d Trump said before an audience of several hundred supporters in a chandeliered ballroom at his Mar-a-Lago club, where he stood flanked by American flags and banners bearing his \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan. \u201cAmerica\u2019s comeback starts right now,\u201d he said, formally beginning the 2024 Republican primary. Another campaign is a remarkable turn for any former president, much less one who made history as the first to be impeached twice and whose term ended with his supporters violently storming the Capitol in a deadly bid to halt the peaceful transition of power on Jan. 6, 2021. Trump also enters the race in a moment of deep political vulnerability. He hoped to launch his campaign in the wake of resounding GOP midterm victories, fueled by candidates he elevated during this year\u2019s primaries. Instead, many of those candidates lost, allowing Democrats to keep the Senate and leaving the GOP with a path to only a bare majority in the House. Trump has been blamed for the losses by many in his party, including a growing number who say the results make clear it\u2019s time for the GOP to move past him and look to the future, with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis emerging from last week\u2019s elections as an early favorite. In addition to trying to blunt his potential rivals\u2019 rise, Trump\u2019s decision to launch his candidacy before the 2022 election had been fully decided also comes as he faces a series of escalating criminal investigations, including several that could lead to indictments. They include the probe into hundreds of documents with classified markings that were seized by the FBI from Mar-a-Lago and ongoing state and federal inquiries into his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. As Trump has spent the last months teasing his return, aides have been sketching out the contours of a campaign that is being modeled on his 2016 operation, when Trump and a small clutch of aides defied the odds and defeated far better-funded and more experienced rivals by tapping into deep political fault lines and using shocking statements to drive relentless media attention. Trump returned to that dark rhetoric in his speech Tuesday, painting the country under President Joe Biden in apocalyptic terms, describing \u201cblood-soaked streets\u201d in \u201ccesspool cities\u201d and an \u201cinvasion\u201d at the border and earning cheers as he vowed to execute those convicted of selling drugs. \u201cWe are a nation in decline,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are here tonight to declare that it does not have to be this way.\u201d Trump notably avoided much talk of the 2020 election, eschewing the extreme conspiracy theories that often dominate his rallies. Still, the speech included numerous exaggerations and deflections as he cast himself as \u201ca victim\u201d of wayward prosecutors and the \u201cfestering, rot and corruption of Washington.\u201d While Trump spoke before a crowd of several hundred, notably missing were many longtime supporters including previous campaign managers, aides and his daughter Ivanka, who released a statement saying that she does not plan to be involved in his campaign. \u201cWhile I will always love and support my father, going forward I will do so outside the political arena,\u201d she said in statement. Even after the GOP\u2019s midterm losses, Trump remains the most powerful force in his party thanks to the loyalty of his base. For years he has consistently topped his fellow Republican contenders by wide margins in hypothetical head-to-head matchups. And even out of office, he consistently attracts thousands to his rallies and remains his party\u2019s most prolific fundraiser, raising hundreds of millions of dollars. But Trump is also a deeply polarizing figure. Fifty-four percent of voters in last week\u2019s midterm elections viewed him very or somewhat unfavorably, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 94,000 voters nationwide. And an October AP-NORC poll found even Republicans have their reservations about him remaining the party\u2019s standard-bearer, with 43% saying they don\u2019t want to see him run for president in 2024. Trump\u2019s candidacy poses profound questions about America\u2019s democratic future. The final days of his presidency were consumed by a desperate effort to stay in power, undermining the centuries-old tradition of a peaceful transfer. And in the two years since he lost, Trump\u2019s persistent \u2014 and baseless \u2014 lies about widespread election fraud have eroded confidence in the nation\u2019s political process. By late January 2021, about two-thirds of Republicans said they did not believe Biden was legitimately elected in 2020, an AP-NORC poll found. VoteCast showed roughly as many Republican voters in the midterm elections continued to hold that belief. Federal and state election officials and Trump\u2019s own attorney general have said there is no credible evidence the 2020 election was tainted. The former president\u2019s allegations of fraud were also roundly rejected by numerous courts, including by judges Trump appointed. While some Republicans with presidential ambitions have long ruled out running against Trump, others, including Vice President Mike Pence, have been taking increasingly public steps toward campaigns of their own, raising the prospect of a crowded GOP primary.  That could ultimately play to Trump\u2019s advantage, as it did in 2016, when he prevailed over more than a dozen other candidates who splintered the anti-Trump vote. Trump\u2019s decision also paves the way for a potential rematch with Biden, who has said he intends to run for reelection despite concerns from some in his party over his age and low approval ratings. The two men were already the oldest presidential nominees ever when they ran in 2020. Trump, who is 76, would be 82 at the end of a second term in 2029. Biden, who is about to turn 80, would be 86. If he is ultimately successful, Trump would be just the second U.S. president in history to serve two nonconsecutive terms, following Grover Cleveland\u2019s wins in 1884 and 1892. But Trump enters the race facing enormous challenges beyond his party\u2019s growing trepidations. The former president is the subject of numerous investigations, including the monthslong probe into the hundreds of documents with classified markings found at Mar-a-Lago. Trump is also facing Justice Department scrutiny over efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. In Georgia, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is investigating what she alleges was \u201ca multi-state, coordinated plan by the Trump Campaign\u201d to influence the 2020 results. Some in Trump\u2019s orbit believe that running will help shield him against potential indictment, but there is no legal statute that would prevent the Justice Department from moving forward \u2014 or prevent Trump from continuing to run if he is charged. Still, Trump\u2019s campaign will further complicate what is already a fraught decision by the Biden Justice Department, which will have to decide not only whether it believes Trump broke the law, but will face enormous political pressure for indicting the man who is now the sitting president\u2019s chief political rival. Already Trump has cast the probe as a politically motivated effort to derail his candidacy. Aides who had succeeded in persuading Trump to delay his announcement until after the midterms had also urged him to wait until after next month\u2019s Senate runoff in Georgia. But Trump chose to ignore the advice. It wasn\u2019t any secret what he had been planning. At a White House Christmas party in December 2020, Trump told guests it had \u201cbeen an amazing four years.\u201d \u201cWe are trying to do another four years,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, I\u2019ll see you in four years.\u201d",

    "Why the AP hasn\u2019t called control of the House yet": [
        "By MEG KINNARDNovember 16, 2022 GMT",
        " The GOP\u2019s wait for a U.S. House majority dragged into a second week, as the amount of votes still to be counted after Tuesday in California and elsewhere kept The Associated Press from calling the final seat Republicans need for control. A week after polls closed in the 2022 midterm elections, the AP had called 217 seats in the House for Republicans \u2014 one seat short of the needed 218 \u2014 to 209 for Democrats, who have held the House since 2018. Republicans have been inching closer to seizing the House since voting closed Nov. 8 but weren\u2019t there yet. California alone has seven races remain to be called, and vote counting continues elsewhere. After a review of vote count updates in several counties in California and Colorado, the AP concluded it was not possible to call another U.S. House race for a Republican candidate Tuesday night without more votes being released.  The AP made House race calls for several Democrats on Tuesday, although not enough for that party to secure control of the chamber, either. Democratic control of the U.S. Senate was settled Saturday when Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada won reelection, but the U.S. House majority is still in question.  WHY HASN\u2019T THE AP CALLED CONTROL OF THE HOUSE YET? It\u2019s simple: Neither party has yet reached the required 218 seats. The AP has declared winners in most contests, but a handful are outstanding.  The AP does not make projections and will only declare a winner when it\u2019s determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. In some contested races where a party or candidate has a history of consistent and convincing wins, The AP can use results from AP VoteCast \u2014 a survey of American voters aimed at determining why they voted how they did \u2014 to confirm a candidate\u2019s victory, even as soon as polls close. But some races, as it is again this year, can take days or even weeks to call. WHAT STATES ARE STILL COUNTING VOTES? California, the country\u2019s most populous state, has seven undetermined contests, with one of them guaranteed to go to one of the two Democrats running against each other in that district. In Alaska, where incumbent Democrat Mary Peltola won a special election this summer to fill an open House seat held for decades by Republicans, a second round of vote tabulating could take place. That\u2019s because Alaska has ranked choice voting in which voters rank candidates. If no one gets more than half of the votes cast on or before Nov. 8, the person with the fewest votes gets eliminated and voters\u2019 choices count toward their second pick. The rounds continue until two candidates are left and the one with the most votes wins. Peltola was leading Republicans Sarah Palin and Nick Begich in a race too early to call.  There\u2019s also a close race in Maine \u2014 headed for a ranked choice finish, like the one in Alaska \u2014 and another in Colorado. WHAT OTHER CHALLENGES ARE THERE? In 2020, former President Donald Trump challenged outcomes of the vote for president in states across the country. Those challenges failed in courts, though Trump continued to insist falsely that the race was stolen. So far, nothing like those kinds of objections has materialized. ___ Meg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP ___ Check out https://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-elections to learn more about the issues and factors at play in the 2022 midterm elections.

    "McCarthy passes 1st House speaker test, but hurdles remain": [
        "By LISA MASCARO and FARNOUSH AMIRINovember 16, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Republican leader Kevin McCarthy won the nomination Tuesday for House speaker, clearing a first step with majority support from his colleagues, but he now faces a weeks-long slog to quell right-flank objections before a final vote in the new year. McCarthy has led House Republicans this far, and with the party now on the cusp of majority control, he has a chance to seize the gavel from Nancy Pelosi if Democrats are defeated.  The GOP leader pushed through the internal party election on a 188-31 vote, with ballots cast by new and returning lawmakers, but the challenges ahead are clear. McCarthy will need to grind out support from no fewer than 218 lawmakers from his slim ranks when the new Congress convenes in January, leaving just a few votes to spare. \u201cWe\u2019ve got our work cut out for us,\u201d McCarthy said, his voice strained after the vote.  The Californian noted that past speakers fell short in initial voting only to eventually claim the gavel, and he has highlighted backing from right-flank Republicans Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio as part of his \u201cvast support.\u201d \u201cEither we\u2019re going to lead as a team or we\u2019re going to lose as individuals,\u201d he said.  But Republican leaders are facing an intense backlash on Capitol Hill over their disappointing performance in the midterm elections, when McCarthy\u2019s promises of a GOP sweep that would transform Washington collapsed. Instead, the House could have one of the slimmest majorities in 90 years, leaving McCarthy exposed to challengers and risking his ability to govern. The fallout is spilling down-ballot into other Republican leadership races and into the Senate, where Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell will face a challenge from GOP Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, the party\u2019s campaign chairman, in elections planned for Wednesday. The former chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, challenged McCarthy but fell short. He still insisted that his speakership \u201cshould not be a foregone conclusion\u201d and said five votes went to neither candidate, an indication of broader opposition to McCarthy.  Many in the Republican Party are blaming their losses on Donald Trump, who announced his 2024 bid for the White House from his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida on Tuesday evening. The former president endorsed hundreds of candidates, many of them far-right contenders rejected by voters. It\u2019s not just McCarthy whose leadership was in question but others on his team. Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., the campaign chairman who traditionally would be rewarded with a leadership spot, ended up slugging it out in a three-way race for the GOP\u2019s whip job, defeating Trump ally Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., after a second-round of voting. The No. 2 Republican, Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, had an easier time, winning the majority leader spot uncontested, by voice vote. Also unopposed, Rep. Richard Hudson, of North Carolina, will lead the campaign arm, the National Republican Congressional Committee. And one of Trump\u2019s top allies in the House, Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York \u2014 the party\u2019s conference chairwoman and the first lawmaker to back Trump in a 2024 run \u2014 fended off rival Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida in a race that was closer than expected.  A self-described \u201cTrump-supporting, liberty-loving, pro-life, pro-Second Amendment Black man,\u201d Donalds is seen by many as a potential new party leader. Trump backs McCarthy for speaker, but the two have had a rocky relationship, and even Trump\u2019s support is no guarantee McCarthy will reach the needed 218 votes when the new Congress convenes, particularly if Republicans win the House with just a slim, few-seat majority that would leave him no cushion for detractors. One Trump ally, Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, opposes McCarthy and predicted he will fall short, as happened in an earlier bid. \u201cTo believe that Kevin is going to be speaker, you have to believe that he\u2019s going to move votes in the next six weeks that he couldn\u2019t move in the last six years,\u201d Gaetz said.  But saying she\u2019s \u201cproud\u201d of McCarthy for listening to all lawmakers, Greene said \u201cit\u2019s so important for us to stay unified and get behind him as our speaker.\u201d It\u2019s a familiar dynamic for House Republicans, one that befell their most recent Republican speakers \u2014 John Boehner and Paul Ryan \u2014 who both retired early rather than try to lead a party splintered by its far-right flank. McCarthy survived those earlier battles between party factions, but he was forced to back out of a bid for the speaker\u2019s job in 2015 when it was clear he did not have support from conservatives.  The weeks ahead promise to be a grueling period of hardball negotiations with the Freedom Caucus and rank-and-file Republicans as McCarthy tries to appease them and rack up the support he will need in the new year.  In a sign of how desperate Republicans are to bolster their ranks, some made overtures to conservative Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas to switch parties and join the GOP. \u201cThey just said, \u2019name your price,\u2033\u201d Cuellar told reporters. \u201cI\u2019m a Democrat.\u201d The conservative Freedom Caucus lawmakers, who typically align with Trump, are prepared to extract demanding concessions from McCarthy before giving him their backing. They have a long list of asks \u2014 from prime positions on House committees to guarantees they can have a role in shaping legislation. \u201cI\u2019m willing to support anybody that\u2019s willing to change dramatically how things are done here,\u201d Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., the chairman of the Freedom Caucus and a Trump ally, said after meeting privately Monday with McCarthy. But even rank-and-file lawmakers are assessing their choices for speaker, a position that is second in line to the president. \u201cI don\u2019t just automatically assume heir apparent, necessarily,\u201d said Rep. Steve Womack, R-Ark. \u201cWe are voting for somebody who is going to be two heartbeats from the presidency.\u201d  Democrats will hold their party elections after Thanksgiving, as Pelosi and the top two leaders, Reps. Steny Hoyer and Jim Clyburn, decide whether to stay on or step aside for a new generation eager to take over. Pelosi could very well join the new Congress in January, declining to run for leadership, having won reelection for another two-year term representing San Francisco.  That\u2019s a route Clyburn, of South Carolina, indicated he would take if Democrats lose majority control. \u201cI\u2019ve told everybody that I have no interest at this particular juncture of my life to run for speaker of the House or to run for minority leader of the House,\u201d Clyburn told reporters. \u201cI do wish to remain at the leadership table. As to what capacity that will be, I will leave that up to our Democratic caucus.\u201d ___ Associated Press writers Kevin Freking and Brian Slodysko and Meg Kinnard in Columbia, S.C., contributed to this report. ___ Follow the AP\u2019s coverage of the 2022 midterm elections at https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections.

    "Trump strikes new overseas deal and raises old ethics issue": [
        "By BERNARD CONDONNovember 16, 2022 GMT",
        " NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump\u2019s company is licensing its name for a golf resort in Oman in the first of what the company hopes will be several overseas deals, raising conflict-of-interest issues as the former president announced a third run for the White House. The Trump Organization said the licensing deal \u2014 the first since Trump left office \u2014 is with Saudi developer Dar Al Arakan and will include a golf course, hotel and thousands of residential units in the Oman capital of Muscat.  Trump\u2019s son Eric, who oversees the company\u2019s global real estate interests, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the company is no longer bound by a self-imposed restriction not to make foreign deals while his father was president. \u201cYou can expect more hotel and golf deals overseas in the future,\u201d Eric Trump said in a text exchange. Trump announced Tuesday that he is running again for the presidency in a speech from his Palm Beach, Florida, club. Trump\u2019s company struck many real estate licensing deals overseas before he entered the White House, including for hotels and residential towers in Canada, Dubai, Mexico, India and Turkey. Some branding experts had expected him to put his name on more buildings after he left office, with the added brand appeal of a former U.S. president. With Trump possibly running again, the company may feel pressure to move fast to add to the Oman deal. Asked if the company would halt such deals if his father was elected, Eric Trump responded, \u201cWhy would we do anything differently?\u201d  The New York Times, which first reported the deal with the Saudi developer, said the $1.6 billion Oman resort will have an estimated 400 hotel rooms and 3,500 residential units. Trump\u2019s close ties to Saudi Arabia\u2019 ruling crown prince drew heavy criticism following its blockade of U.S. ally Qatar during his administration and the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist critical of the regime.  Since leaving office, Trump has hosted two tournaments at his properties for the upstart Saudi-funded LIV Golf series that critics say should not be given a venue in the U.S. given the regime\u2019s human-rights record. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and former senior aide, Jared Kushner, has also drawn scrutiny from Democrats for a reported $2 billion investment from a Saudi sovereign wealth fund for his investment fund started after he left the White House. Unlike Trump\u2019s build-and-own ventures earlier in his career, licensing offers a relatively easy and risk-free way to generate cash assuming his brand remains strong. Before his 2016 election, Trump\u2019s real estate licensing deals generated as much as $30 million in revenue in 17 months through May of that year, according to financial documents he had to file as a candidate. Much of that revenue was profit since it was Trump\u2019s partners who owned the businesses and bore the costs, not him.  Just how much is profit is unclear, but Trump\u2019s longtime finance chief, Allen Weisselberg, told Businessweek in a 2015 interview that the company overall made about 50 cents on every $1 in revenue, thanks partly to licensing. Since the Trump Organization is private it is nearly impossible to confirm those figures.",

    "Fight over election tally threatens Arizona certification": [
        "By BOB CHRISTIENovember 16, 2022 GMT",
        " PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 The two Republicans who control the elected board in a rural Arizona county have sued their own elections director to force her to conduct a greatly expanded hand-count of ballots cast in the Nov. 8 elections, a standoff that could affect certification of the results. They want Cochise County Elections Director Lisa Marra to hand over the roughly 12,000 ballots cast on Election Day to the county recorder, an elected Republican. The elected county prosecutor warned the private lawyers representing the two GOP board members that taking ballots without authorization could subject their clients to felony charges. At a raucous board meeting Tuesday, several members of the public berated the two Republicans on the three-member board for pursuing the hand-count and seeking to pay for the case with county funds. One called a board member a \u201cdemagogue\u201d who is \u201cmaking a disgusting sham\u201d of the democratic process. The push to hand-count ballots in the Republican-heavy county in the state\u2019s southeast corner, which is home to the iconic Old West town of Tombstone, gained impetus from false claims by former President Donald Trump and his allies of widespread fraud and voting machine conspiracy theories in the last presidential contest. There has been no evidence of widespread fraud or manipulation of voting machines in 2020 or during this year\u2019s midterm elections. Nevertheless, the conspiracy theories have spread widely and prompted heated public meetings in mostly rural counties throughout the West amid calls to ditch voting machines in favor of paper ballots and full hand-counts. The controversies nearly delayed certification of primary results earlier this year in one New Mexico county and have fed an ongoing legal battle over a full hand-count in a Nevada county.  Republicans in Arizona lost the major races in this year\u2019s election, including for U.S. Senate, governor and secretary of state. Arizona\u2019s evolution into a political battleground has angered many conservatives in a state traditionally seen as staunchly Republican. In Cochise County, the Republican candidates for those posts won by wide margins. The Republicans\u2019 lawsuit, filed late Monday, comes a week after a judge blocked the board from hand-counting all ballots cast during early voting but also gave them space to pursue a wider hand-count. The judge said state law allows the county to expand the small hand-count used for the official audit that is designed to confirm the accuracy of vote-counting machines, provided it\u2019s done randomly. After the ruling, Republican board member board Peggy Judd proposed an expansion of the hand-count to as many as 99% of the Election Day ballots, although that proposal has now been slightly trimmed. The lawsuit filed by attorneys for Judd and the other GOP board member, Tom Crosby, said they hope to hand-count four races on all ballots from 16 of the county\u2019s 17 vote centers. Their lawsuit against the county elections director says she refused their order to either conduct the expanded count herself or hand the ballots over to Republican county Recorder David Stevens so he can do the tally. It seeks an order compelling her to turn over the ballots. Upping the stakes, the lawsuit contends the Republican board members have concluded that the expanded hand-count is \u201cnecessary to ensure completeness and accuracy before certifying the election.\u201d The county\u2019s certified results must be received by the secretary of state no later than Nov. 28. That means time is short to get a court ruling, pull about 12,000 Election Day ballots from the director\u2019s possession and gather the more than 200 volunteers Stevens has said he is ready to do the hand-count. Another 32,000 ballots were cast early. If the county misses the certification deadline, the secretary of state\u2019s office or a candidate could go to court and ask a judge to force the board to certify the results. The deadline is in state law, and election rules based on that law say county officials must certify and cannot change the results. The Pima County judge who heard heard the previous case because local judges declared a conflict will also consider the new lawsuit. Judge Casey McGinley set a daylong hearing for this coming Friday.  The lawsuit also says Republican County Attorney Brian McIntyre \u201chas made clear that he will prosecute any attempt by the Board and Recorder to exercise their lawful authority to take custody of the ballots to complete an expanded hand-count themselves.\u201d McIntyre has repeatedly told the board in recent weeks that their efforts would be illegal, as has Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, the state\u2019s top elections officer and Democratic governor-elect. Republican Attorney General Mark Brnovich, however, issued an informal opinion backing the board. An attorney for Marra said Tuesday her client had not been formally served but that she was just beginning to review the lawsuit. A formal response would likely come soon.  Marra conducted the required hand-count audit on Saturday, as did other counties across the state. Those audits choose a sample of both Election Day and early ballots. Bipartisan teams of volunteers provided by the chairs of the county Democratic and Republican parties count four races \u2014 five in a presidential election year. Marra\u2019s certification to Hobbs\u2019 office says two batches of early ballots and two batches of Election Day ballots from two vote centers were counted, totaling 2,202 ballots. The hand-count results matched the machine count exactly. ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the elections at: https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections Check out https://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-elections to learn more about the issues and factors at play in the 2022 midterm elections.",

    "Florida\u2019s Scott takes on McConnell in bid for Senate leader": [
        "By BRIAN SLODYSKO and MARY CLARE JALONICKNovember 16, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Florida Sen. Rick Scott said Tuesday that he will mount a long-shot bid to unseat Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, opening the latest front in an intraparty battle between allies of McConnell and former President Donald Trump over the direction of the GOP following a disappointing showing in last week\u2019s midterm elections.  The announcement by Scott, who was urged to challenge McConnell by Trump, came hours before the former president was expected to launch a comeback bid for the White House. It escalated a long-simmering feud between Scott, who led the Senate Republican\u2019s campaign arm this year, and McConnell over the party\u2019s approach to reclaiming a Senate majority. \u201cIf you simply want to stick with the status quo, don\u2019t vote for me,\u201d Scott said in a letter to Senate Republicans offering himself as a protest vote against McConnell in leadership elections on Wednesday.  Restive conservatives in the chamber have lashed out at McConnell\u2019s handling of the election, as well as his iron grip over the Senate Republican caucus. The leadership vote was scheduled for Wednesday morning, though it could be postponed if Texas Sen. Ted Cruz succeeds with his effort to delay it until after a Georgia runoff election in December. A delay could give leverage to Trump-aligned conservatives who are hoping their clout will grow after the outcome of races in Georgia, where former NFL star Herschel Walker is challenging Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, and Alaska, where moderate Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski faces a conservative challenger. Yet it appears unlikely that their numbers could grow enough to put McConnell\u2019s job in jeopardy, given his deep support within the conference. And Trump\u2019s opposition is hardly new, as has been pushing for the party to dump McConnell ever since the Senate leader gave a scathing speech blaming the former president for the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.  Still, it represents an unusual direct challenge to the authority of McConnell, who is set to become the longest-serving Senate leader in history if he wins another leadership term. \u201cWe may or may not be voting tomorrow, but I think the outcome is pretty clear,\u201d McConnell told reporters Tuesday. \u201cI want to repeat again: I have the votes; I will be elected. The only issue is whether we do it sooner or later.\u201d  Scott was one in a small group of senators who wrote a letter to the Republican caucus over the weekend asking for a delay in this week\u2019s leadership elections \u201cto have serious discussions within our conference as to why and what we can do to improve our chances in 2024.\u201d  Republican senators debated the path forward during their regular party lunch on Tuesday. Inside the room, roughly 20 senators spoke. Scott and McConnell traded what colleagues said were \u201ccandid\u201d and \u201clively\u201d barbs, sparring over the midterms, the quality of the GOP candidates who ran and their differences over fundraising. Senators made their individual cases for the two men. Some members directly challenged Scott in McConnell\u2019s defense, including Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who questioned the Florida senator\u2019s management of the NRSC, according to a person familiar with the meeting. Scott \u201cdisagrees with the approach that Mitch has taken in this election, and for the last couple of years he made that clear,\u201d said Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, who has called for a delay and to oust McConnell. \u201cSenator McConnell criticized Senator Scott\u2019s management of the NRSC. I imagine we\u2019ll hear more of that tomorrow.\u201d Among the many reasons Scott listed for mounting a challenge is that Republicans had compromised too much with Democrats in the last Congress \u2014 producing bills that President Joe Biden has counted as successes and that Democrats ran on in the 2022 election. \u201cI believe it\u2019s time for the Senate Republican Conference to be far more bold and resolute than we have been in the past,\u201d Scott said in the letter, sent to colleagues as the GOP meeting was still going on. \u201cWe must start saying what we are for, not just what we are against.\u201d  But as the leader of the National Republican Senatorial Committee following a disappointing election, Scott is also an imperfect vessel to achieve the aims of frustrated Republicans and Trump. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to make this about assessing blame for losing an election, I don\u2019t know how the NRSC chairman gets off the hook,\u201d said North Dakota Sen. Kevin Cramer. \u201cI think that would be the obvious problem he would have.\u201d The feud between Scott and McConnell has been percolating for months and reached a boil as election results trickled in showing there would be no Republican Senate wave, as Scott predicted, according to senior Republican strategists. They and others interviewed about the feud were not authorized to discuss internal issues by name and insisted on anonymity. Operatives for the two men have traded barbs for more than a year over the handling of Senate Republican political strategy \u2014 or, in the view of some, the lack thereof. The feuding started not long after Scott took over the party committee in late 2020, which many in the party viewed as an effort to build his national political profile and donor network ahead of a potential presidential bid in 2024. Some were irked by promotional materials from the committee that were heavy on Scott\u2019s own biography, while focusing less on the candidates who are up for election. Then came Scott\u2019s release of an 11-point plan early this year, which called for a modest tax increase for many of the lowest-paid Americans, while opening the door for cutting Social Security and Medicare, which McConnell swiftly repudiated even as he declined to offer an agenda of his own.  Staffers from Scott\u2019s Senate committee moved into triage mode almost immediately, reaching out to Republican campaigns across the country to gauge their frustration while offering messaging help, according to senior Republican strategists with direct knowledge of the situation who viewed it as an \u201cunforced error.\u201d \u201cA strategic disagreement\u201d is how Scott has characterized their divergent views. In August, McConnell undercut Scott during a Senate GOP lunch. Shortly after Scott had made a request for committee donations from Republican senators, McConnell addressed the room and told the Senators to instead prioritize giving to Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC controlled by longtime McConnell allies, according to two people familiar with the discussion. Last week, McConnell\u2019s super PAC cut Scott out of their efforts to boost turnout in the Georgia runoff, with the super PAC teaming up with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp\u2019s political operation instead. The decision was driven in part by the fraying trust in Scott\u2019s leadership, as well as poor finances of the committee, which was $20 million in debt, according to a senior Republican consultant. For some Senate Republicans, however, the feud is irrelevant to their decision to support Scott. \u201cWe got to have a plan for the American public and if we don\u2019t we can expect much more of the same,\u201d said Indiana Sen. Mike Braun, who is supporting Scott\u2019s challenge of McConnell.",

    "Masters concedes Senate race, Hobbs celebrates governor win": [
        "By JONATHAN J. COOPERNovember 15, 2022 GMT",
        " PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 Republican Blake Masters called Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly Tuesday to concede in the Arizona Senate race, joining other vanquished Republicans around the country who cast doubt on the 2020 election but still acknowledged their own defeat. Kari Lake, the Republican candidate for governor, however, had not conceded a day after The Associated Press called the race for Democrat Katie Hobbs. \u201cThere were obviously a lot of problems with this election, but there is no path forward,\u201d Masters wrote in a statement he posted to Twitter. He did not specify the problems, but has previously complained about long lines at polling places and a problem with ballot printers at about a third of the vote centers in Maricopa County, which includes metro Phoenix.  Masters said \u201cRepublicans are the underdogs now,\u201d saying he attracted millions in opposition spending by antagonizing Democrats, the media, big tech firms and \u201cwoke corporations.\u201d Republicans need to rethink the way they run campaigns, he said.  Democrats now control Arizona\u2019s two U.S. Senate seats and the governor\u2019s office for the first time since 1950. A Democrat was also elected secretary of state this year and the race for attorney general was extremely close.  Republicans who lost their races in other states have generally conceded defeat, including Doug Mastriano, a prominent election denier who lost the race for Pennsylvania governor. But in Arizona, Masters is an exception among the statewide candidates. Mark Finchem, who lost the secretary of state race to Democrat Adrian Fontes, has spent days spreading Q-Anon memes and conspiracy theories alleging the contest was stolen from him.  Lake has said little in public aside from a one sentence tweet Monday night: \u201cArizonans know BS when they see it.\u201d  Her campaign team and the Arizona Republican Party have pushed people who voted by mail to verify that their ballot was accepted. Mail voters whose ballots get flagged for problems have until the end of Wednesday to resolve the issue. They\u2019ve also been looking to collect testimonials from people who say they faced problems voting in person on election day, which could be used in a lawsuit.  Overall, 38% of voters in Arizona said they were \u201cvery\u201d confident that midterm votes would be counted accurately, according to AP VoteCast, an expansive survey of more than 3,200 voters in Arizona. Sixty-four percent of Hobbs voters were that confident, compared with only 12% of voters backing Lake. An additional 43% of Lake voters were somewhat confident, but 44% were not confident. While about two-thirds of voters in Arizona overall say Biden was legitimately elected in 2020, only about a third of Lake voters say so. \u201cIn this election, Arizonans chose solving our problems over conspiracy theories,\u201d Hobbs told supporters in a victory speech Monday. \u201cWe chose sanity over chaos and we chose unity over division. We chose a better Arizona. And we chose democracy.\u201d  But she said the work to safeguard democracy continues. Hobbs built a reputation as a staunch defender of Arizona\u2019s election as former President Donald Trump and his supporters spread false claims of fraud in 2020 and state Senate Republicans oversaw an unprecedented partisan audit of the vote count.  Lake has cast doubt on the 2020 election and refused before the election to commit to accepting the results if she lost.  Outgoing Republican Gov. Doug Ducey called to congratulate Hobbs from Orlando, Florida, where the Republican Governors Association is meeting, spokesman C.J. Karamargin said. Ducey is co-chairman of the group tasked with raising money and recruiting candidates to help the GOP win races for governor. The RGA spent more than $10 million on television ads attacking Hobbs.  When she takes office in January, Hobbs will be Arizona\u2019s first Democratic governor since Janet Napolitano resigned to join Barack Obama\u2019s administration in 2009. She will likely work with a Republican-controlled Legislature, and she pledged Monday to keep her door open to members of both parties.  \u201cBut for those of you who prefer to obstruct, spread disinformation and continue to pursue an extreme agenda out of touch with this state, take note of the results of this election,\u201d Hobbs said.  ___ Associated Press writer Hannah Fingerhut in Washington contributed.

    "Judge says Michael Flynn must testify in Ga. election probe": [
        "By CURT ANDERSON and KATE BRUMBACKNovember 15, 2022 GMT",
        " SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) \u2014 A Florida judge on Tuesday said former national security adviser Michael Flynn must testify before a special grand jury in Atlanta that\u2019s looking into whether then-President Donald Trump and his allies illegally tried to influence the 2020 election in Georgia. Sarasota County Chief Judge Charles Roberts ordered Flynn to testify before the panel on Nov. 22. Attorneys for Flynn, a retired lieutenant general who served briefly as national security adviser under Trump, had argued that the special grand jury\u2019s investigation was a civil matter, rather than a criminal one. For that reason, Flynn should not be compelled to testify, they argued. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney, who\u2019s overseeing the special grand jury, has said that the special grand jury\u2019s investigation is a criminal proceeding. He also certified Flynn as a \u201cnecessary and material witness.\u201d Roberts honored that, saying, \u201cGeneral Flynn is a material witness.\u201d The judge also denied a motion by Flynn\u2019s attorneys to stay his ruling in anticipation of an appeal.  \u201cThere\u2019s no undue hardship,\u201d Roberts said.  Flynn spoke only in response to the judge\u2019s questions and did not answer reporters\u2019 questions after the hearing. Because Flynn lives outside Georgia, Willis had to use a process to try to get a judge where he lives in Florida to order him to comply with her summons.  The investigation, led by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, is seen as one of the most significant potential legal threats to the former president as he prepares to announce a third run for the presidency. Willis has sought the testimony of numerous high-profile Trump associates as witnesses in the investigation. Former New York mayor and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, who\u2019s been told he could face criminal charges in the investigation, testified in August. Judges have also ordered former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich to testify later this month. Gingrich on Monday initiated an appeal of his ruling. Cassidy Hutchinson, who served as an aide to Meadows, is expected to appear before the special grand jury Wednesday. In testimony in June before the U.S. House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Hutchinson detailed what she saw and heard at the White House on that day and in the days preceding the insurrection, including discussions of how Trump\u2019s election loss could be overturned. The special grand jury has also heard from high-ranking state officials, including Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Attorney General Chris Carr. Gov. Brian Kemp, who had tried unsuccessfully to avoid testifying but was allowed to delay his appearance until after last week\u2019s election, was seen leaving the courthouse Tuesday. All of those state officials received calls from Trump in the aftermath of the 2020 election. In an interview on a right-wing cable news channel in mid-December 2020, Flynn said Trump \u201ccould take military capabilities\u201d and place them in swing states and \u201cbasically re-run an election in each of those states,\u201d Willis wrote in a petition seeking to compel his testimony before the special grand jury. Flynn also met at the White House on Dec. 18, 2020, with Trump, attorney Sidney Powell and others associated with the Trump campaign for a meeting that, according to news reports, \u201cfocused on topics including invoking martial law, seizing voting machines, and appointing Powell as special counsel to investigate the 2020 election,\u201d Willis wrote. And he attended meetings in November 2021 at the South Carolina home of conservative attorney Lin Wood. Willis wrote that Wood said in a television interview that they met to look into possible ways to influence the election results in Georgia and elsewhere. Wood told The Associated Press that he testified before the special grand jury last week. Willis opened the investigation early last year, shortly after a recording of a Jan. 2, 2021, phone call between Trump and Raffensperger was made public. In that call, the Republican president urged Raffensperger to \u201cfind\u201d the votes needed to overturn his narrow loss in the state to Democrat Joe Biden.  The investigation\u2019s scope has broadened since then, and a special grand jury with subpoena power was seated in May, allowing Willis to compel testimony from people who might otherwise refuse. The special grand jury operates in secret with witness testimony closed to the public. Special grand juries in Georgia are generally used to investigate complex cases with many witnesses. They can compel evidence and subpoena testimony from witnesses, but they cannot issue indictments. Once its investigation is complete, a special grand jury can recommend action, but it remains up to the district attorney to decide whether to then seek an indictment from a regular grand jury. ___ Brumback reported from Atlanta.

    "Oath Keepers defendant downplays \u2018heavy weapons\u2019 message": [
        "By LINDSAY WHITEHURSTNovember 15, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A defendant charged alongside members of the far-right Oath Keepers militia group in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol played down his message about ferrying \u201cheavy weapons\u201d across the Potomac River, calling it \u201ccreative writing\u201d in testimony Tuesday. Thomas Caldwell, 68, said he was never serious about trying to secure a boat to transport weapons across the river from a massive \u201cquick reaction force\u201d arsenal that Oath Keepers had stashed in a hotel room. His query about boating \u201cheavy weapons\u201d was among prosecutors\u2019 most chilling pieces of evidence in the case that accuses Caldwell and others of a violent plot to stop the transfer of presidential power from Republican Donald Trump to Democrat Joe Biden. \u201cI do a lot creative writing and I just got out there,\u201d Caldwell testified. Caldwell said the boat idea didn\u2019t start with him, and he let it go after failing to find one. The guns never left the hotel room, but they\u2019re a key piece of prosecutors\u2019 seditious conspiracy case alleging the group plotted to block the transfer of power by force.  The defense has spent weeks hammering prosecutors\u2019 lack of evidence of an explicit plan to attack the Capitol before Jan. 6, 2021. They say the Oath Keepers came to Washington to provide security at events for figures such as Trump ally Roger Stone before the president\u2019s big outdoor rally behind the White House. Caldwell took the stand as the trial against him, Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes and three others was winding to a close after more than a month of testimony. It\u2019s the most serious case to reach trial yet in the Jan. 6 attack that left police officers bloodied and bruised and sent lawmakers running for their lives. Closing arguments could happen as early as this week.  Prosecutors spent weeks methodically laying out how they say the Oath Keepers plotted for weeks to overturn Biden\u2019s election victory by any means necessary.  Messages from Caldwell included a November 2020 missive after the Million MAGA March where he wrote that \u201cwe could have burned Congress down if we had wanted to\u201d and another from shortly after the election raising the possibility of \u201ccivil war.\u201d On cross-examination, prosecutors showed messages that appeared to contradict his testimony, including his statement that he didn\u2019t witness any violence when he and his wife entered Capitol grounds on Jan. 6. Caldwell responded he had been joking or exaggerating in his original missives, or sharing things he heard from others. At times, his explanations were confounding. For example, when prosecutors showed a video of his wife using a vulgar term in reference to Congress during the riot, he said she was trying to express that it was a \u201cgreat opportunity to start the healing process in our country.\u201d Caldwell told jurors that his previous trips into Washington before Jan. 6 weren\u2019t recognizance for an Oath Keepers operation but rather an effort to determine how many portable bathrooms would be available and where they would be. Caldwell first met Oath Keepers members in November 2020, and grew close to them, allowing them to stay on his rural Virginia property. He didn\u2019t officially join the group.  A disabled 19-year veteran of the U.S. Navy who suffered cracked vertebrae in the line of duty as a young man, he now copes with a range of physical ailments and uses a cane to walk as needed. He once had a top-secret security clearance and once worked for the FBI, his lawyer has said.  Defense lawyers have accused prosecutors of ripping Oath Keepers\u2019 messages out of context to paint them unfairly.  ___ For full coverage of the Capitol riot, go to https://www.apnews.com/capitol-siege",

    "Biden facing pressure to extend student loan payment pause": [
        "By COLLIN BINKLEY and CHRIS MEGERIANNovember 15, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 In the days and weeks before the midterm election, President Joe Biden trumpeted his plan to cancel billions in student loans as he rallied young people to support Democrats.  But now the entire initiative is in jeopardy because of legal challenges that could ensure no one receives a dollar of debt relief. The debacle is swiftly becoming a headache for the administration instead of an example of how the president keeps his promises to voters.  The White House insists it will ultimately prevail even though two federal courts blocked the program from taking effect. However, the setbacks have rattled supporters who fear that more than 40 million Americans who expected relief will instead start getting billed for their student debt in January, when a pandemic-era moratorium on payments is slated to expire.  \u201cYou cannot ask people to begin repaying on a debt that shouldn\u2019t exist,\u201d said Melissa Byrne, an advocate for loan cancellation. \u201cWe bear no blame in this broken system.\u201d The impasse has left the White House in a bind over whether to extend the moratorium if the legal battle drags on even though Biden has said the pandemic, the original reason for the pause in payments, \u201cis over.\u201d The freeze has already cost the federal government more than $100 billion in lost revenue, according to the Government Accountability Office. Critics such as the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget are warning that another extension could worsen inflation and raise the risk of economic recession. Republicans oppose cancellation as an unfair handout for the wealthy, arguing Americans who didn\u2019t go to college will bear the cost as well. Conservatives have orchestrated a barrage of legal attacks against Biden\u2019s plan, saying it overstepped the president\u2019s authority. In the meantime, borrowers across the nation yet again face uncertainty. An estimated 20 million were eligible to get their federal student debt canceled entirely by Biden\u2019s plan, which would cancel $10,000 in student loan debt for those making less than $125,000 or households making less than $250,000. Those who receive Pell Grants, typically given to those with lower incomes, would get another $10,000 in forgiveness. Now, it\u2019s unclear if borrowers will be expected to make payments on that debt when the pause ends, and the political hazards are growing. At risk is support from 43 million borrowers who have been promised at least some debt relief, including millions of younger Americans, a demographic that helped deliver key wins for Democrats last week. Adwoa Asante, who is eligible for $20,000 in cancellation, said it would be \u201cdestabilizing\u201d if her payments restart in January. The 33-year-old Dallas attorney owes $163,000 in law school debt, with monthly bills of up to $2,000. Asante voted for Biden but criticizes him for reaping the benefits of his plan in the midterms only to have borrowers left out in the cold. \u201cHonestly, there\u2019s a lot of frustration toward the Biden administration. I think that they anticipated that there would be legal challenges to the student loan cancellation,\u201d she said, calling the court challenges \u201cto be expected.\u201d Cedric Richmond, who worked in the White House before becoming a senior adviser to the Democratic National Committee, doubted that Biden will face political fallout if the program is ultimately blocked.  If the program is ultimately blocked, he said, \u201cthe blowback should go exactly where it deserves, and that\u2019s with this rogue Supreme Court.\u201d About 6 in 10 voters under 45 approve of Biden\u2019s handling of student debt, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 94,000 voters nationwide. Voters as a whole were almost evenly divided on the issue, while Democrats were far more likely to show approval than Republicans. Nearly 26 million people already have applied for the debt relief, out of an estimated 43 million eligible. The Education Department stopped accepting new applications Friday after a federal judge in Texas struck the plan down. Speaking in New Mexico on Nov. 3, Biden said he was on solid legal ground. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting them in court,\u201d he said. We\u2019re not letting them get away with it.\u201d Without the promised relief, advocates say many borrowers could quickly fall into default on their student loans. Nearly half of borrowers surveyed by the Student Debt Crisis Center say they will be unable to afford student debt payments within six months, according to a report released Tuesday. \u201cBorrowers do not feel that the pandemic is over, they do not feel that the economic impacts are over,\u201d said Natalia Abrams, president of the center. \u201cWe need to pause payments until all legal hurdles are cleared.\u201d The legality of mass student debt forgiveness was in question from the start. After being elected, Biden said it would be best if the measure came from Congress. Soon before leaving office, the Trump administration released a memo concluding that the White House does not have authority for wide cancellation. Supporters say they still have faith that Biden\u2019s plan will survive, despite predictions that it could go before a Supreme Court that has shifted to the right and curbed Biden\u2019s authority in other decisions. They argue that the Higher Education Act, a sprawling federal law, already gives the president wide power to cancel federal student debt. Some groups say Biden should pursue other legal avenues to deliver his promise. The Debt Collective, a union of borrowers, is urging Biden to cancel debt immediately by invoking the Higher Education Act, the same legal authority initially suggested by supporters including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. \u201cHe has an ace up his sleeve and he hasn\u2019t used it,\u201d said Braxton Brewington, a spokesperson for the collective. \u201cThe Biden administration should simply sidestep these lawsuits.\u201d Some legal scholars say Biden should scrap the current plan and start over. Jed Shugerman, a law professor at Fordham University in New York, said he believes the White House made a mistake in its legal reasoning. \u201cThe Biden administration has run into trouble that was clearly foreseeable,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should go back to square one.\u201d Even though that would take time, Shugerman said, it\u2019s better than waiting for a loss from the Supreme Court. The White House, he said, is \u201csticking to a sure loser\u201d instead of \u201cchanging tracks to something that has a better chance.\u201d ___ Associated Press writers Hannah Fingerhut and Claire Savage contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press education team receives support from the Carnegie Corporation of New York.

        "By JESSE BEDAYNNovember 15, 2022 GMT",
        " DENVER (AP) \u2014 Colorado Democratic state Rep. Yadira Caraveo has defeated Republican state Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer in a tight race to win a U.S. House seat in a new district that stretches north of Denver\u2019s suburbs. The Associated Press called the race in Colorado\u2019s 8th Congressional District on Tuesday, although Caraveo claimed victory and Kirkmeyer conceded after voting ended on election night on Nov. 8. The swing district, evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans, was created during the once-a-decade redistricting process to reflect Colorado\u2019s growing population. Caraveo\u2019s win comes as Republicans were on the cusp of taking control of the House in the midterm elections after Democrats retained control in the Senate.  Caraveo said in a statement last week claiming victory: \u201cIt\u2019s the honor of my lifetime to receive this vote of confidence to serve working families from Greeley to Commerce City in Washington, D.C.\u201d  Caraveo is a pediatrician and defender of abortion rights who voted for police accountability after protests that followed the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd. Caraveo hoped her cultural lineage as the child of Mexican immigrants would attract support in a swing district where Latinos comprise nearly 40% of voters.  Kirkmeyer, a former Weld County commissioner, pledged to get tough on crime and unleash the oil and gas industry, which has a significant presence in the district. She once supported a blanket ban on abortion but now says she would respect exceptions if the mother\u2019s life is in danger. \u201cWhile this is not the outcome we hoped for,\u201d Kirkmeyer wrote on Twitter announcing her defeat, \u201cI am proud of our team and our campaign.\u201d ___ Jesse Bedayn is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

    "Trump-backed Nevada GOP Senate candidate concedes loss": [
        "By KEN RITTERNovember 15, 2022 GMT",
        " LAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 The Republican challenger to Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada conceded on Tuesday that he lost, issuing statements saying that he won\u2019t contest the result but calling mail-in balloting a \u201ctactic\u201d that tilted the balance. \u201cI am confident that any challenge of this election would not alter the ultimate outcome,\u201d GOP candidate Adam Laxalt said in a tweet that campaign adviser Robert Uithoven confirmed was authentic. Laxalt, who had the vocal endorsement of former President Donald Trump, called Cortez Masto to congratulate her on her victory, Cortez Masto campaign aide Sigalle Reshef confirmed. The Associated Press called the race on Saturday, declaring Cortez Masto the winner.  Laxalt told the AP more than a year ago that he was preparing legal challenges to the outcome of the 2022 election. In his Twitter statement and a separate email sent Tuesday to supporters, he complained that \u201cRepublican turnout on Election Day was significantly lower than expected as we needed to overcome nearly three weeks of Democrat-favored mail-in voting.\u201d \u201cNevada\u2019s new elections laws enacted two years ago allowed for massive ballot harvesting and votes dropped off at drop boxes and polling places on Election Day,\u201d Laxalt said in the email. \u201cRepublicans will either have to fix our election laws or better adjust to them and to the tactics used against us.\u201d He said mail-in voting \u201cis not a form of voting Republican voters prefer, so as those ballots were tabulated, they skewed heavily towards Democrats up and down the ballot, including our opponent.\u201d Uithoven characterized the tweet as a brief public statement and said the email \u201cprovided a little more detail\u201d to Laxalt\u2019s supporters. There have been no allegations of widespread problems in Nevada\u2019s elections. The governor\u2019s seat flipped from Democrat to Republican when Las Vegas-area Sheriff Joe Lombardo defeated incumbent Gov. Steve Sisolak. The GOP also won statewide lieutenant governor and controller posts. Nevada\u2019s vote count took several days partly because the Legislature in 2020 adopted a law requiring counties to accept ballots postmarked by Election Day if they arrive up to four days later. Laxalt had an early lead that dwindled after late-counted ballots came in from the state\u2019s population centers in Las Vegas and Reno. Cortez Masto\u2019s win, along with Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly\u2019s victory in Arizona, gave Democrats a 50-49 edge in the Senate. Along with Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 tiebreaking vote, the party will retain control of the chamber no matter the result of next month\u2019s Georgia runoff between Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican candidate Herschel Walker. Cortez Masto, the first Latina to serve in the Senate, was considered the most vulnerable Democratic senator in the midterm elections, and the Republican Party had high hopes of flipping the seat.  She raised far more money than Laxalt, but had to weather an onslaught of attack ads funded by national GOP groups. Cortez Masto spent nearly $47 million and had more than $6 million in cash on hand through mid-October, according to OpenSecrets, a nonprofit that tracks campaign finances and lobbying. Laxalt spent nearly $13 million and had about $3 million remaining during the same time. Cortez Masto is a former two-term state attorney general. She focused her Senate campaign on threats to abortion access nationwide and worked to court the state\u2019s Spanish-speaking residents and hourly wage earners. She pointed out her support of a permanent pathway to citizenship for \u201cDreamers\u201d and regularly visited union halls and workers\u2019 groups. Laxalt is the grandson of former GOP U.S. Sen. and Nevada Gov. Paul Laxalt and the son of former Republican Sen. Pete Domenici, of New Mexico. He served one elected term as Nevada attorney general, lost a bid for governor in 2018 and co-chaired Trump\u2019s failed campaign in Nevada in 2020 \u2014 spending months leading efforts in the media and in courts to challenge the result as fraudulent. Laxalt insisted that ineligible and dead voters cast ballots, that laws adopted by the Democratic-led Legislature to send mail-in ballots to every active voter invited fraud, and that Republican observers were prevented from seeing ballot counting or challenging signatures on mail-in ballots. Only a case to keep some Las Vegas-area polling places open until people in line had cast ballots briefly survived court scrutiny. Like the others, it was later dismissed. \u201cI entered this arena for my family and those all over Nevada and America who believe our country is headed in the wrong direction,\u201d Laxalt, an attorney, said in his statements on Tuesday. He said he will \u201creturn to private life and private practice.\u201d \u201cThis race and the 2022 election cycle didn\u2019t go as we hoped,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I am proud of the race that we ran.\u201d ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the elections at: https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections",

    "Biden asks for over $37 billion in emergency Ukraine aid": [
        "By COLLEEN LONGNovember 15, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden is asking Congress to provide more than $37 billion in emergency aid to Ukraine, a massive infusion of cash that could help support the nation as Russian forces suffer battlefield losses in their nine-month-old invasion.  The administration\u2019s funding request, which comes as lawmakers begin their post-election session, also seeks $9.25 billion in COVID-19 funding to prepare for a possible winter surge and help combat the virus nationwide. Government funding expires in mid-December, and the Ukraine and COVID aid would be part of the package to fund the government through the end of September 2023.  The request for such a sizable amount of money for Ukraine comes as the GOP is poised to take control of the House following the midterm elections. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, who is in line to become speaker, has warned that Republicans wouldn\u2019t support writing a \u201cblank check\u201d for Ukraine if they capture the majority. Shalanda Young, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said that more than three-fourths of the $40 billion approved by Congress earlier this year for Ukraine has already been disbursed or committed. The Biden administration has asked for a total of $37.7 billion in support.  \u201cTogether, with strong, bipartisan support in the Congress, we have provided significant assistance that has been critical to Ukraine\u2019s success on the battlefield \u2014 and we cannot let that support run dry, \u201d Young said in a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The proposed Ukraine assistance includes $21.7 billion for military, intelligence and other defense support, $14.5 billion in humanitarian aid and to help keep the Ukrainian government functioning, $900 million for health care and support services for Ukrainians living in the U.S. and $626 million for nuclear security support to Ukraine and for modernizing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  U.S. aid to Ukraine has already included tens of thousands of missiles and rockets for air defense and anti-armor systems, and more than 84 million rounds of ammunition, as well as drones, tanks, trucks, radars, body armor and other gear. Ukrainian leaders have begged for more advanced, longer-range weapons, but the U.S. has been careful to not provide systems that would allow Ukrainian forces to strike deep into Russia or hit Moscow.  In recent months the U.S. assistance has centered on air defense systems and a constant stream of ammunition. Those systems have been critical in helping Ukrainian forces mount a massive counteroffensive that has been able to beat back the advances of Russian forces in the south and east and recapture key territory. The retaking of Kherson, the only provincial capital captured by the Russians, was one of Ukraine\u2019s biggest successes in the nearly nine-month-old Russian invasion. It dealt a stunning battlefield loss to Moscow, but large parts of eastern and southern Ukraine remain under Russian control and fighting continues. Russian airstrikes have been targeting civilian infrastructure, including power grids, and they are causing widespread blackouts around the country. The attacks appear aimed at leaving Ukrainian civilians in the cold and dark as winter approaches. Biden sought $13.7 billion in emergency funding in September, and signed a bill that authorized roughly $12 billion and kept the government funded.  House Foreign Affairs committee chairman Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., said the new emergency request was \u201curgent to make sure that we get them everything that we can possibly get into the omnibus so that they have the weapons to continue the momentum moving through the winter.\u201d He expressed concerns that Ukraine funding could be jeopardized with the GOP in charge of the House.  \u201cI would hope that if they do take over, that their leadership will get them in line so that we can preserve democracy and not allow Russia to win,\u201d he said. The coronavirus funding ask is considerably lower than the previous request of $22 billion, which reflects in part the changing nature of the virus and the continued effort to combat it, but also the reluctance among Republicans in Congress to continue to fund COVID-19 efforts.  The request includes $2.5 billion for vaccines and therapeutics, $5 billion to support development of new vaccines, $750 million to support research into long COVID and $1 billion to combat the virus internationally. The request also includes $400 million in funding for smallpox vaccines used for monkeypox response, and $350 million for hepatitis C and to help prevent HIV.  A request for additional disaster relief funding should come soon but isn\u2019t yet finalized, White House officials said.  ___ Associated Press Writers Lolita C.

    "Business group sues over new corporate ownership database": [
        "By FATIMA HUSSEINNovember 15, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A small business lobbying group filed suit Tuesday to block the Treasury Department\u2019s upcoming requirement that tens of millions of small businesses register with the government as part of an effort to prevent the criminal abuse of anonymous shell companies. The National Small Business Association argues that the new reporting rule violates the U.S. Constitution, saying it is unduly burdensome on small firms, violates privacy and free speech protections and infringes on states\u2019 powers to govern businesses. The legal challenge points to the friction between maintaining privacy rights and the government\u2019s effort to uncover sources of criminal activity, especially as the U.S. attempts to sanction Russian oligarchs and wealthy friends of Russian President Vladimir Putin since the start of his invasion of Ukraine.  The wealthy Russians are accused of hiding stolen money and assets in the U.S. and around the world. \u201cWe already have very strong rules in place where financial institutions actually see the transfer of money through the economy, and do follow up on the data collected,\u201d Todd McCracken, president of the small business group, said at a news conference. He said small business owners are \u201chugely concerned\u201d about their private information being shared with the government.  The group filed a lawsuit in Alabama federal court against the Treasury Department, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and acting director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Himamauli Das.  The rule finalized in September requires most American businesses with fewer than 20 employees \u2014 roughly 32.6 million companies \u2014 to register with the government as of Jan. 1, 2024. They must provide the government with details on their owners and others who benefit from them under a regulation that\u2019s intended to peel back the layers of ownership that can hide unlawfully obtained assets. Treasury officials said the regulatory burden will be small, costing about $85 per business, but will offer massive benefits to law enforcement, which will be one of few parties with access to the database. Small businesses are targeted because shell companies, often used to hide illegally obtained assets, tend to have few employees. Ian Gary, executive director of the FACT Coalition, a nonprofit that promotes corporate transparency, said in an email that the new rule \u201cwill protect our financial system and small businesses from the criminal abuse of anonymous shell companies.\u201d A representative from Treasury declined to comment on the lawsuit.  Kenyen Brown, an attorney representing the small business association, said the law, while well-intentioned, is a \u201cgross government overreach.\u201d \u201cThe right avenues for the government to gather money laundering and possible anti-terrorism financing activity is through transaction monitoring and financial institutions performing their due diligence,\u201d he said, adding that the new registration rule \u201cis not the way.\u201d",

    "Voters OK drastic overhaul of City Hall in Portland, Oregon": [
        "By CLAIRE RUSHNovember 15, 2022 GMT",
        " PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) \u2014 Voters in Portland, Oregon, driven by frustration with surging homelessness and a desire to make government more inclusive, have approved a ballot measure that will completely reinvent City Hall, ushering in seismic changes that local officials will have just two years to put in place. The hotly debated measure will upend almost everything about how Portland is run. It will more than double the number of City Council members, overhaul how voting is conducted and dissolve a power structure that many saw as being plagued by mismanagement and bureaucracy. Previous attempts to change the system failed, but following the sustained Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 and amid a spiraling homelessness crisis, this time \u201cthe broader conditions were really ripe for it to pass,\u201d said pollster John Horvick, senior vice president of DHM Research. \u201cThe combination of dissatisfaction with the city, plus an effectively delivered message around inclusion in elections \u2014 that really resonated with a segment of voters,\u201d Horvick said. Following the passage of the measure, which will update the city\u2019s charter for the first time in over 100 years, local officials are now scrambling to assess how to revamp City Hall by the two-year deadline, November 2024. They will also have to figure out how to juggle its multimillion-dollar price tag with the city\u2019s other financial priorities, including the construction of a network of campsites for homeless people. Portland Commissioner Mingus Mapps, who campaigned against the measure, said implementing the reforms will be like \u201ctrying to launch to the moon\u201d from an idea scribbled on the back of a napkin. \u201cI hope people realize that this is not a minor reform or even a major reform,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a fundamental reimagining and rebuilding of local government here in Portland.\u201d The measure will scrap Portland\u2019s unusual commission form of government, under which City Council members act as administrators of the city\u2019s bureaus, and replace it with the more common mayor-council system. It will expand the city council from five to 12 members, who will be elected by voters in the districts they represent rather by voters citywide. The four new districts will be \u201cmulti-member,\u201d meaning they will each be represented by three councilors. The mayor will no longer serve on the City Council, and a city administrator will be hired to oversee the bureaus. Logistical complexities abound. For one, the current City Hall building, which was completed in 1895, doesn\u2019t have a big enough chamber, or enough office space, to accommodate the expanded council. \u201cWe would certainly have to hold City Council meetings in a different building,\u201d Mapps said. \u201cLiterally, our City Hall building becomes obsolete.\u201d The measure will also implement a form of ranked choice voting known as single transferable vote. Under the system, ballots are counted in rounds with City Council candidates only needing 25% of the vote to win. If a candidate exceeds that threshold, their surplus votes are transferred to the next candidate ranked on each voter\u2019s ballot. If no candidate receives 25% in the first round, the one with the fewest votes is eliminated and their votes are transferred to the next preferred candidate on each voter\u2019s ballot. Changing Portland\u2019s charter had been on the ballot before \u2014 under city law, a 20-person commission must convene every 10 years to review it \u2014 and it had always failed to pass. But the most recent charter review process kicked off during the summer of 2020, as protests over the police killing of George Floyd erupted nightly on Portland\u2019s streets and a nationwide reckoning with racism prompted conversations about making government more accountable and equitable. The group that campaigned for the measure, Portland United for Change, said the new system could boost voter turnout and make government more representative. It highlighted the months of listening sessions held with historically marginalized communities and its endorsements from dozens of community groups, including local chapters of the NAACP and the American Civil Liberties Union. Opponents pointed out that no other U.S. city uses this specific voting system for multi-member districts in City Council elections. They also denounced the price tag: City Hall estimates the transition could cost up to $17.7 million over the next three years, and that ongoing costs could reach $8.7 million per year. Critics say this money is sorely needed to address the city\u2019s most pressing problems, including homelessness and crime. Just two days after Election Day, Mayor Ted Wheeler requested $27 million from the City Council to help fund the construction of city-designated campsites for homeless people, after the council\u2019s recent vote to ban street camping and create sanctioned camping areas. Portland United for Change recognized that public outreach and education explaining how the new system works will be vital in the months to come. But the group also pointed to the wide margin of support seen in returns so far as a sign that many voters are open to the changes. \u201cI think it just truly shows that it was powered by the people and for the people,\u201d said Sol Mora, the group\u2019s campaign manager. \u201cIt just feels so exciting to know that at a time when democracy is under attack across the nation, Portland is serving as a model of the type of representation that all communities can have.\u201d Under the measure, Portland will hold its first election using geographic districts and ranked-choice voting in November 2024, with the new City Council taking office in January 2025. ___ Claire Rush is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

    "Documents show big foreign gov\u2019t spending at Trump hotel": [
        "By BERNARD CONDONNovember 15, 2022 GMT",
        " NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The Trump hotel in Washington took in more than $750,000 from six foreign governments at sensitive moments in their U.S. relations, with guests spending as much as $10,000 per room a night, according to documents from the Trump family company\u2019s former accountants released Monday by a congressional committee.  The Trump International Hotel received at least $259,724 on a visit by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak and other officials in September 2017 while the U.S. Justice Department was investigating his role in a money laundering scandal, according to a statement released by the Democratic-led House Oversight Committee.  Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates spent at least $164,929 that same year and in 2018 for hotel stays while trying to win over support after their blockade of Qatar, according to the committee, citing documents from former Trump accountants Mazars USA. For its part, Qatar spent more than $300,000 at the hotel. The heavy foreign government spending at Donald Trump\u2019s hotel, since sold to a Miami-based investment firm, has been reported before but details and the timing of this snapshot of payments are new. Two days after a March 2018 stay by the Saudis, the committee noted, then-president Trump approved $1.3 billion in arms sales to the country.  \u201cThese documents sharply call into question the extent to which President Trump was guided by his personal financial interest while in office rather than the best interests of the American people,\u201d Oversight Committee Chair Carolyn Maloney, Dem.-New York, said in statement. The Trump Organization said the former president, far from being influenced by spending at his hotel and other properties, made an effort to avoid even the appearance he would be so influenced. \u201cWe walked away from billions of dollars in new deals, ceased all international expansion, engaged with an outside ethics advisor to review any material transactions and furthermore, have voluntarily donated all profits from foreign government patronage at our properties back to the United States Treasury on an annual basis,\u201d said Eric Trump, a son helping run the business. \u201cNo president has made a greater financial sacrifice for the benefit of the country.\u201d The Trump hotel down the street from the White House, now a Waldorf Astoria, drew criticism from the start of Trump\u2019s presidency for taking money from GOP poliicians, companies and foreign governments eager to curry favor with him. The hotel lost tens of millions of dollars each year while he was in office, though the Trump family did well in the end \u2014 selling it for $375 million earlier this year, allowing it to pocket as much as $100 million in profit. Along with the Mazars documents, the Oversight Committee released a letter sent Monday to the National Archives and Records Adminstration for reports and communications related to spending at the hotel and policies or investigations that involved the foreign governments at the time. The committee had previously disclosed that the Trump hotel had taken in more than $3.75 million from foreign governments while Trump was president.  Among the details in Monday\u2019s release was that Prime Minister Razak spend $1,500 on a personal trainer and more than $8,000 for in-room lunches while being investigated for money laundering in the U.S. The Malaysian government later prosecuted Razak.  The Saudi Ministry of Defense spent $85,961 in a March 2018 stay, booking several suites at the hotel for $10,500 each, the most expensive rooms available. The Qatari government spent heavily, too. Between January and early March 2018, the ruling family of Sheikh Al Thani paid nearly $300,000 for an extended stay at the hotel. The Mazars documents show that lobbyists for the Turkish govenment and a state-owned bank spent more than $80,000 during a Justice Department money laundering investigation of that bank that Istanbul wanted dropped, according to the committee. And two months before a 2017 meeting between Tump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, that country\u2019s embassy spent nearly $20,000 at the hotel. __ This story was first published on November 14, 2022. It was updated on November 15, 2022 to correct that Saudi Arabia did not invade Qatar and to specify that the dollar figure reflects spending by both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, another participant in the blockade.",

    "\u2018Did not end well\u2019: New Pence book details split with Trump": [
        "By JILL COLVINNovember 15, 2022 GMT",
        " NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Former Vice President Mike Pence blames Donald Trump for endangering his family \u201cand all those serving at the Capitol\u201d on Jan. 6 in a new memoir released Tuesday. In \u201cSo Help Me God,\u201d Pence recounts, for the first time in his own words, the Republican former president\u2019s extraordinary effort to push him to overturn the results of the 2020 election and shares his account of the day thousands of rioters stormed the Capitol, with some chanting \u201cHang Mike Pence.\u201d \u201cThey had come to protest the result of the election and to prevent Congress from fulfilling its responsibility to open and count the Electoral College votes,\u201d Pence writes. \u201cAnd, as I later learned, many had come looking for me.\u201d The book, which traces Pence\u2019s life in politics \u2014 from serving as youth coordinator for a local Democratic Party to watching then-Vice President Al Gore certify his election loss days after Pence had been sworn in as a member of Congress \u2014 largely defends Trump, glossing over and whitewashing many of his most contentious episodes. \u201cI had always been loyal to President Donald Trump,\u201d the book begins. But Pence, who spent years refusing to publicly criticize his old boss, makes clear that Jan. 6, 2021, was a breaking point in which, he writes, Trump\u2019s \u201creckless words had endangered my family and all those serving at the Capitol.\u201d \u201cFor four years, we had a close working relationship. It did not end well,\u201d Pence writes, summing up their time in the White House. Still, he adds, \u201cwe parted amicably when our service to the nation drew to a close. In the months that followed, we spoke from time to time, but when the president returned to the rhetoric that he was using before that tragic day and began to publicly criticize those of us who defended the Constitution, I decided it would be best to go our separate ways.\u201d The book, published by Simon & Schuster, comes as Pence appears increasingly likely to run for president in 2024, a move that would put him in direct conflict with Trump, who is expected to formally launch his own reelection campaign in Florida on Tuesday night.  Pence, who in the book never directly states that Democrat Joe Biden won fairly, writes that when Trump first suggested holding a rally in Washington on Jan. 6, the day Pence was set to preside over the election\u2019s certification, he thought it was a good idea. \u201cMy first thought was that a rally that day might be useful as a way to call even more attention to the proceedings on the floor of the House and Senate,\u201d he writes. Instead, Pence describes sitting in the Senate chamber and presiding over the certification when the Senate parliamentarian leaned over to inform him that rioters had breached the building and a member of his Secret Service detail rushing over to insist they leave. Pence refused to vacate the building and was instead ushered to a Senate loading dock, where he spent hours, surrounded by staff and family members, making calls to military and congressional leaders to coordinate the government\u2019s response, as the president \u2014 who never bothered to check in on Pence\u2019s safety \u2014 sat cloistered, watching TV. \u201cAll around was a blur of motion and chaos: security and police officers directing people to safety, staffers shouting and running for shelter. I could see the intensity in the eyes of the Secret Service detail; it was audible, too, in the voices of the Capitol Police. I could hear the fall of footsteps and angry chanting,\u201d Pence writes. Still, Pence insists he was \u201cnot afraid,\u201d only angry at what was unfolding. At 2:24 p.m., as Pence remained in hiding, Trump fired off that infamous tweet saying Pence \u201cdidn\u2019t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution.\u201d \u201cI just shook my head,\u201d Pence said he responded. \u201cThe truth was, as reckless as the president\u2019s tweet was, I really didn\u2019t have time for it. Rioters were ransacking the Capitol. ... The president had decided to be part of the problem. I was determined to be part of the solution. I ignored the tweet and got back to work.\u201d Pence also describes Trump\u2019s campaign to pressure him to reject the results of the election by rejecting Electoral College votes or sending them back to the states, even though the Constitution makes clear that the vice president\u2019s role is purely ceremonial. During one lunch on Nov. 16, 2020, Pence said he told Trump that \u201cif the legal challenges came up short and if he was unwilling to concede, he could simply accept the results of the elections, move forward with the transition, and start a political comeback, winning the Senate runoffs in Georgia, the governor\u2019s race in Virginia in 2021, and the House and Senate in 2022.\u201d \u201cThat accomplished, I said, he could run for president in 2024 and win,\u201d Pence writes. \u201cHe seemed unmoved, even weary, at the prospect.\u201d \u2033\u2018I don\u2019t know, 2024 is so far off,\u2019\u201d Pence writes that Trump told him \u201cbefore returning to the status of election challenges in various states.\u201d At another lunch, Pence said he encouraged Trump \u201cnot to look at the election \u2018as a loss \u2014 just an intermission\u2019\u201d and said if he \u201cstill came up short\u201d after exhausting every legal option, Trump should \u201ctake a bow\u201d and later run again. \u201cHe nodded, pointed at me as if to say, \u2018That\u2019s worth considering,\u2019 and walked into the back hallway,\u201d Pence writes. \u201cI will always wish he had.\u201d But as the lawsuits Trump\u2019s legal team was pushing continued to fail, Pence writes that Trump\u2019s mood darkened and he became increasingly irate. Pence says Trump berated him, telling him, \u201cYou\u2019re too honest,\u201d and predicting that \u201chundreds of thousands are gonna hate your guts\u201d and \u201cpeople are gonna think you\u2019re stupid.\u201d \u201cAs the days wore on, it was becoming clear that there would be a real cost to me politically when I presided over the certification of the 2020 election,\u201d Pence writes. \u201cI always knew that I did not possess the authority to overturn the election. I knew it would be hurtful to my friend for me to participate in the certification. But my duty was clear.\u201d After the Capitol was cleared of the rioters, Congress reconvened and Pence presided over the certification of his and Trump\u2019s loss. For several days the two men did not speak. But when they finally met, five days later, Pence said they spent more than 90 minutes together, alone. \u201cI told him that I had prayed for him for the past four and a half years, and I encouraged him to pray,\u201d Pence said he told Trump. \u201c\u2018Jesus can help you through this,\u2019 I said. \u2018Call on Him.\u2019 He didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d \u201cWith genuine sadness in his voice, the president then mused, \u2018What if we hadn\u2019t had the rally? What if they hadn\u2019t gone to the Capitol?\u2019 Then he said, \u2018It\u2019s too terrible to end like this.\u2019\u201d",

    "G-20 to condemn Russia\u2019s Ukraine invasion, urge an end": [
        "By SEUNG MIN KIM, ZEKE MILLER and ELAINE KURTENBACHNovember 15, 2022 GMT",
        " NUSA DUA, Indonesia (AP) \u2014 Leaders of most of the world\u2019s economic powers are nearing approval of a declaration strongly denouncing Russia\u2019s invasion that has devastated Ukraine and roiled the global economy. Even China, which has mostly declined to censure Russia until now, and India, which buys weapons from Russia, are providing encouraging words. On Tuesday, U.S. President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pressed fellow leaders for a robust condemnation of Russia\u2019s nuclear threats and food embargoes. More discussion and a possible vote come Wednesday at the summit, which has proved unusually eventful, even including a COVID-19 scare when Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen tested positive and flew home. No other leaders were reported positive. A draft declaration by leaders of the Group of 20 echoes the United Nations\u2019 condemnation of Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine, though acknowledging differing views among members. The careful wording of the statement reflects tensions prevailing at the gathering, which includes leaders from Russia and China, and the challenge facing the U.S. and its allies to isolate Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s government. Some nations want badly to avoid becoming entangled in antagonisms between the biggest powers. Still, if adopted in its current form, the declaration would be a strong rebuke of the war that has killed thousands, heightened global security tensions and disrupted the world economy. That would be an especially significant step since China and India abstained from condemning Russia\u2019s aggression in the March U.N. resolution. The draft statement seen Tuesday by The Associated Press \u201cdeplores in the strongest terms the aggression by the Russian Federation\u201d and \u201cdemands its complete and unconditional withdrawal from the territory of Ukraine.\u201d The G-20 statement does note that there are different views on the situation and on sanctions against Russia, saying that the G-20 is not the forum for resolving security issues.  U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan decried Russia\u2019s latest strikes in Ukraine. \u201cIt is not lost on us that, as world leaders meet at the G-20 in Bali to discuss the issues of significant importance to the lives and livelihoods of people around the world, Russia again threatens those lives and destroys Ukraine\u2019s critical infrastructure,\u201d he said in a statement. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who led the Russian delegation to Indonesia in place of Putin, denounced the Biden administration push to condemn Moscow. \u201cAll problems are on the Ukrainian side that categorically refuses to hold any talks and comes up with conditions obviously unrealistic and inadequate to this situation,\u201d Lavrov said. Another big problem for the global economy the past two years has been the COVID-19 pandemic. Though no cases were reported at the summit other than the Cambodian prime minister, many of the leaders had attended meetings with him just days earlier during a separate summit in Cambodia of the Association of Southeast Asian nations.  Biden skipped an evening gala Tuesday hosted by Indonesian President Joko Widodo, to attend to unspecified matters. Biden sent his regrets to Widodo and said he would attend a planned tree planting with fellow G-20 leaders on Wednesday, according to a White House official. The official, who was not authorized to comment and spoke on the condition of anonymity, noted it had been a \u201cfull day\u201d for the president but insisted that Biden\u2019s absence was not related to COVID-19. Back at the G-20\u2032s main business, Zelenskyy delivered a video address trying to persuade the group to further isolate Russia diplomatically and economically, despite the financial worries that have tested many nations\u2019 resolve. Inflation and slowing economies already are weighing on countries that have imposed penalties on Russia for starting the war. Higher costs for energy and food have hurt business activity around the world, as much of Europe prepares to brave the winter without imports of Russian natural gas. Indonesia\u2019s Widodo said ominously, \u201cIf the war does not end, it will be difficult for the world to move forward.\u201d Zelenskyy reiterated 10 conditions for ending the conflict that began in February, among them a complete withdrawal of Russian troops and full restoration of Ukrainian control of its territory. He spoke days after Ukraine retook the strategic city of Kherson from Russian forces, in his country\u2019s latest counteroffensive that has forced Moscow to withdraw some forces from occupied areas. \u201cUkraine should not be offered to conclude compromises with its conscience, sovereignty, territory and independence,\u201d he said. \u201cUkraine has always been a leader in peacekeeping efforts, and the world has witnessed it. And if Russia says that it supposedly wants to end this war, let it prove it with actions.\u201d At the summit, Biden met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who played a pivotal role this summer in brokering a deal to open up Ukrainian grain exports to ease global food shortages. Biden also met briefly with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose cooperation is needed to secure a U.S.-sought price cap on Russian oil to limit the profits Moscow uses to invest in its defense base. Modi, whose country will assume the G-20 presidency after Indonesia, reiterated his call for \u201cthe path of ceasefire and diplomacy\u201d in the war in Ukraine and spoke about efforts by world leaders in World War II to pursue a \u201cpath of peace.\u201d Separately, U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres held a lengthy meeting Tuesday with Lavrov to discuss the Black Sea Grain Initiative, said U.N. spokesperson Florencia Soto Ni\u00f1o. The deal, which allowed major grain exporter Ukraine to resume exports from ports that had been blocked due to the war, is up for renewal on Saturday. The U.S. and its allies have responded to Russia\u2019s invasion with their own export controls and other sanctions, making it harder for Russia\u2019s military to access key technologies and resupply with drones, artillery and other weapons.  Chinese officials have largely refrained from public criticism of Russia\u2019s war, although Beijing has avoided direct support of the Russians, such as supplying arms. Biden said that during his meeting Monday with Chinese President Xi Jinping they discussed the war and \u201creaffirmed our shared belief\u201d that the use or even the threat of nuclear weapons was \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d \u2014 a reference to Moscow\u2019s thinly veiled threats to use atomic weapons as its invasion of Ukraine has faltered. Xi told G-20 leaders the global economy should not be weaponized. \u201cWe must resolutely oppose the attempt to politicize food and energy issues or use them as tools and weapons,\u201d he said in translated remarks.  After meeting with Xi, French President Emmanuel Macron said they had called for \u201crespect of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine.\u201d  In a tweet, Macron said France and China were determined to \u201cput an end to the escalation of the war in Ukraine and deal with its consequences.\u201d The summit is the first for two critical new partners in Biden\u2019s effort: British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni. Sunak, who took office last month, has promised to continue his conservative predecessors\u2019 steadfast support for Ukraine. He and Biden were set to strategize during their Wednesday meeting on new ways to bolster Ukraine\u2019s defenses for the long haul. Meloni has pledged to continue to provide arms and aid for Ukraine, but questions remain over her far-right coalition\u2019s commitment to stand up to Russia. She and Biden met on the sidelines of the summit on Tuesday and discussed China, the climate crisis, the impact of Russia\u2019s invasion on the global energy market, and their commitment to providing Ukraine support, according to a White House statement.  ___ AP writers Niniek Karmini, Foster Klug and Adam Schreck in Nusa Dua, Indonesia and Josh Boak and Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed.

    "Democrats sue for Saturday voting in Georgia Senate runoff": [
        "By JEFF AMYNovember 15, 2022 GMT",
        " ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock\u2019s campaign and Democratic groups are suing the state of Georgia to overturn guidance by Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger that counties can\u2019t offer Saturday voting ahead of next month\u2019s Senate runoff election. The lawsuit, filed late Monday by the Democratic Party of Georgia, Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Warnock campaign, challenges the state\u2019s finding that it would be illegal to hold early voting on Nov. 26, the day after a state holiday. The lawsuit says the state\u2019s interpretation hurts Warnock in particular because Democrats tend to push early voting more than Republicans. The race between Warnock and his Republican challenger, Herschel Walker, is headed to a Dec. 6 runoff after neither candidate won a majority of votes in the midterm election. Democrats have already secured control of the Senate but are hoping to increase their narrow margin with a Warnock victory. \u201cIllegal attempts to block Saturday voting are another desperate attempt by career politicians to squeeze the people out of their own democracy and to silence the voices of Georgians,\u201d Quentin Fulks, Warnock\u2019s campaign manager, said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re aggressively fighting to protect Georgia voters\u2019 ability to vote on Saturday.\u201d  Raffensperger dismissed the lawsuit as politics. \u201cSenator Warnock and his Democratic Party allies are seeking to change Georgia law right before an election based on their political preferences,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of muddying the water and pressuring counties to ignore Georgia law, Senator Warnock should be allowing county election officials to continue preparations for the upcoming runoff.\u201d Walker\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Under Georgia\u2019s 2021 election law, there will be only four weeks before the runoff \u2014 with Thanksgiving in the middle. Many Georgians will be offered only five weekdays of early in-person voting beginning Nov. 28. And June\u2019s primary runoffs showed time for mail ballots to be received and returned can be very tight. Raffensperger and Deputy Secretary of State Gabriel Sterling had initially said they expected at least some counties would offer voting on the Saturday after Thanksgiving. State law requires at least five weekdays of early in-person balloting beginning Monday, Nov. 28, but also directs Georgia\u2019s 159 counties to open early in-person voting \u201cas soon as possible\u201d in a runoff. But Sterling told The Associated Press in a Friday interview that officials had researched the law and concluded that it would be illegal to hold early voting on a day after a state holiday. Thanksgiving and the following Friday are both state holidays. Raffensperger\u2019s office followed up Saturday with an official election bulletin to the counties setting the position into writing. The plaintiffs say Raffensperger\u2019s interpretation \u201cmisreads\u201d and \u201ccherry-picks\u201d the law. They argue that the bar on voting after a holiday applies only to primary and general elections and not to runoffs. They say a 2017 revision of state law dropped the holiday exception for runoffs, and that reading it that way would mandate early voting on Saturday, Nov. 19, an impossibility since state officials don\u2019t plan to certify the midterm election results until Monday, Nov. 21. \u201cThe Secretary\u2019s insistence that counties may not hold advance voting on November 26 therefore has no support in the law,\u201d lawyers wrote. The lawsuit, filed in Fulton County Superior Court, asks a judge to rule that the law doesn\u2019t bar counties from holding advance voting on Saturday, Nov. 26 and to bar Raffensperger from interfering with counties holding voting on that day. The plaintiffs also ask for an emergency hearing and temporary restraining order. The DSCC has sent letters encouraging counties to defy Raffensperger and schedule Saturday voting anyway. But the lawsuit notes that the State Election Board might retaliate against counties that go ahead by investigating or suspending election officials. Atlanta\u2019s Fulton County is already under investigation after Republican lawmakers used a provision in Georgia\u2019s 2021 election law to demand a state inquiry. Republicans pushed through the election law in response to Donald Trump\u2019s false claims that he had been cheated out of victory in Georgia. Republicans argued the law was needed to restore public confidence, but it shortened the period to request an absentee ballot and limited ballot drop boxes, leading to a Democratic outcry.  Saturday voting had less participation during the general election than weekday early voting, but Democrats argue that it benefits people who can\u2019t vote on weekdays and that eliminating Saturday voting would harm Warnock \u201cby eliminating a potential advance voting day that is likely to be used by voters who affiliate with the Democratic Party.\u201d The lawsuit plays out against a yearslong background of clashes over voting in Georgia. In 2018, Democrat Stacey Abrams claimed Republican Brian Kemp used his position as secretary of state to improperly hold back likely Democratic voters in their gubernatorial contest that year. The Abrams-founded Fair Fight Action lost a lawsuit over those claims. ___ Learn more about the issues and factors at play in the midterms at https://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-elections.

    "Record 12 women to serve as governors, with notable firsts": [
        "By THOMAS BEAUMONTNovember 15, 2022 GMT",
        " DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 A record 12 women will take their seats as their state\u2019s highest-ranking elected officials when the nation\u2019s governors are sworn in this winter.  The number tops the high mark set in 2004 of nine, with The Associated Press\u2019 calling the Arizona governor\u2019s election for Democrat Katie Hobbs on Monday, as well as Democrat Maura Healey in Massachusetts and Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders in Arkansas winning last week\u2019s elections.  \u201cThis is not an incremental growth. We\u2019re still far from political parity for women serving as chief executives. But it does feel like a breakthrough,\u201d said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. \u201cIt\u2019s significant particularly because these chief executive positions have been very hard to crack. These women in many ways disrupt fundamentally who a chief executive can be.\u201d Sanders, the daughter of former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and White House press secretary during the Trump administration, will be the first woman to become her state\u2019s governor. Dobbs, on the other hand, will be her state\u2019s fifth woman in the governorship when she takes the oath of office in early January.  The dozen are decidedly Democratic in their makeup, with eight belonging to the party compared to four Republicans. That\u2019s in keeping with more women serving in elected office who identify as Democrats than Republicans in the U.S. House, Senate and in state legislatures.  Other firsts in the group include newly-elected Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, who will be among the first two openly-lesbian governors with Healey in Massachusetts. Kotek is succeeding Gov. Kate Brown, a Democrat who identifies as bisexual and was the first openly LGBTQ woman in the United States elected governor in 2014.  Despite the gains, only one woman of color was elected governor. New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat who is Latina, was reelected. Three black women \u2014 Stacy Abrams of Georgia, Deidre DeJear of Iowa and Yolanda Flowers of Alabama \u2014 won the Democratic nomination for governor but were defeated by Republican incumbent governors last week.  The others are Republicans Kay Ivey of Alabama, Kim Reynolds of Iowa and Kristi Noem of South Dakota, and Democrats Kathy Hochul of New York, Janet Mills of Maine, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Laura Kelly of Kansas.

    "Senate won for Democrats, \u2018It\u2019s the year of Chuck Schumer\u2019": [
        "By MARY CLARE JALONICK and LISA MASCARONovember 15, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was eating Peking duck at a Chinese restaurant with family and friends on Manhattan\u2019s West side on Saturday evening when an aide called with urgent news: Democrats would win Nevada\u2019s Senate seat and keep their majority.  The restaurant erupted in cheers as the news flashed across a television screen, and a group celebrating a birthday sent him a slice of cake.  But Schumer didn\u2019t stay to celebrate. He was soon rushing back across town for an impromptu, late-night news conference in the lobby of a building near his office.  \u201cI will once again be majority leader,\u201d he declared to the cameras, almost giddily.  The 2022 election  It was vindication for the often-underestimated Schumer, in particular, who has racked up a series of unexpected legislative victories this year as he has navigated Democrats\u2019 slim 50-50 majority, with Vice President Kamala Harris a tie-breaking vote. But the midterm elections held the biggest surprise of all, with his party successfully defending seats despite historical trends and low approval ratings for President Joe Biden. The result: another two years of narrow Senate control.  Even a narrow majority has huge consequences for Biden and his party, as the Senate confirms executive branch nominees and judges, including for the Supreme Court if there are any vacancies in the next two years. Democrats will be able to decide what bills to put on the Senate floor as Republicans \u2014 who will possibly control the House \u2014 beat up on the president politically ahead of the 2024 election.  \u201cListen, I was on top of every one of these campaigns,\u201d Schumer said in an interview in his Capitol office on Monday, a fire roaring behind him and his elation still evident. He said he believes Democrats won because they had better candidates and because of their legislative achievements \u2014 allowing the government to negotiate some prescription drug costs, investments to fight climate change and a bipartisan effort to tighten who can own guns, among other measures that passed over the summer.  \u201cThis was always my plan,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cGet things done, and focus on those things, and don\u2019t get diverted.\u201d Lastly, he said, voters rejected anti-democratic efforts by Republicans who supported former President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the last election.  \u201cWe were on the precipice of autocracy gnawing away at our democracy,\u201d said Schumer, who noted that the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection brought new attention to the attack over the summer, with multiple hearings and images of Trump\u2019s supporters beating up police getting heavy airtime. \u201cAmerican voters said, \u2018I don\u2019t like this. I\u2019m going to reject it.\u2019 And the American people saved us.\u201d  In his own election postmortem on Monday, Republican leader Mitch McConnell saw it differently, describing the Democrats\u2019 narrow win in the Senate and still-uncalled House control as confirmation of a \u201cclosely divided nation.\u201d Making the case directly to voters in Georgia, who will decide a December runoff between Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican candidate Herschel Walker, McConnell asserted that Democratic policy failures led to high inflation.  If Warnock wins, the Democrats will have a 51-49 majority. And Schumer will have protected every one of his incumbents in the election \u2014 a stunning feat. Elected to represent New York in the House in 1980 and then the Senate in 1998, Schumer has long been known for his political acumen \u2014 he was in charge of Democrats\u2019 winning Senate efforts in 2006 and 2008 \u2014 and as a master communicator. But to his colleagues, the midterm election results are confirmation of his skills as a legislative leader as well. While he has been criticized by Republicans and some progressive groups for giving up some items on Democrats\u2019 wish list, the party had accomplishments to point to in the election, and lawmakers say that gave them new momentum over the summer.  \u201cIt\u2019s the year of Chuck Schumer,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who spearheaded bipartisan negotiations on gun legislation. The election wins were \u201cset up by a bunch of victories that ended up motivating both swing and base voters,\u201d Murphy said, particularly the sweeping health, climate and economic package that Democrats passed after Schumer negotiated one-on-one with moderate Democrat Joe Manchi n of West Virginia, who had singlehandedly killed an earlier version of the legislation.  Murphy said Schumer\u2019s style is \u201ctotally unique, and it\u2019s very well suited to a 50-50 Senate,\u201d in that he knows when to micromanage and when to ease off. Murphy said he talked to Schumer several times a day while he was negotiating the gun bill, but he still let Murphy take the lead.  In terms of bipartisan negotiations, \u201cleaders have to be pretty confident to let that evolve,\u201d said Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat who was part of those talks. At the same time, Warner said, \u201canybody that underestimates Chuck\u2019s focus and attention to detail does so at their own peril.\u201d  Schumer brags about his communication skills, noting he has every Democratic senator on speed dial in his famous flip phone. And he knows many of their numbers by heart, he said.  \u201cEvery member calls me,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t go through staff. They can talk to me directly, no email.\u201d  Brian Fallon, a former Schumer aide who is now the executive director of Demand Justice, a liberal advocacy group that supports expanding the court, said Schumer has \u201ccome into his own in the last two years\u201d in terms of legislative maneuvering. At no moment was that more evident than this summer, Fallon said, when Schumer unexpectedly announced the deal with Manchin on the sweeping package of bills and took angry Republicans by surprise.  \u201cHe\u2019s had his own sort of Harry Reid moment the last several months,\u201d said Fallon, referring to the late Nevada senator and majority leader who was known as one of the Senate\u2019s toughest dealmakers before passing the torch to Schumer. Reid died last year.  The next two years won\u2019t be easy, even if Warnock does win and give Democrats a crucial extra seat. Several Democratic incumbents are up for reelection in 2024, and Republicans still have a good chance of winning the House majority, making negotiations tougher for Schumer.  \u201cSo where do we go from here?\u201d Schumer asked. The Democratic leader said he intends to sit down with McConnell and try to find places to agree, even though the two men have traditionally had a frosty relationship.  \u201cI\u2019m going to make a real effort to do as much as we can,\u201d Schumer said, echoing what he\u2019s said since he took the top job two years ago. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to focus on getting things done. That means we\u2019re going to have to compromise.\u201d",

    "Shapiro to take office with mandate from Pennsylvania voters": [
        "By MARC LEVYNovember 15, 2022 GMT",
        " HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) \u2014 Josh Shapiro, the Democratic governor-elect of Pennsylvania, will take office with a decisive mandate from voters, who overwhelmingly rejected a Republican drive to pare back abortion rights and voting laws in the premier battleground state. Shapiro, the state\u2019s two-term attorney general, scored a massive 14 percentage point win over Republican rival Doug Mastriano in last week\u2019s midterm election, smashed state campaign finance records and became the first candidate since 1966 to succeed a governor of the same party in Pennsylvania. Democrats in the state also flipped a U.S. Senate seat \u2014 just the second time since the Civil War that the state elected two Democrats to the chamber \u2014 while winning a majority of the state\u2019s congressional seats and possibly even control of the state House of Representatives for the first time in 12 years. U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., said the election results showed voters\u2019 eagerness to protect abortion rights and the sanctity of elections from subversion by far-right Republicans who promoted former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies about voter fraud in his 2020 loss. \u201cIn a lot of ways, it was a triumph over extremism as much as anything, and we probably underestimated that in the election,\u201d Casey said. Set to be sworn in Jan. 17, Shapiro will take the reins in a state riven by bitter partisanship over voting laws and the management of the COVID-19 pandemic by his predecessor, outgoing Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf. That helped drive a record number of vetoes by one governor going back to the 1970s. Shapiro will likely face battles with Republicans who control the state Senate over the grist of statehouse business, such as budgeting. And, with the 2024 presidential election looming, big questions remain unresolved over the state\u2019s voting laws after three years of partisan gridlock, ongoing court battles over mail-in voting and Trump\u2019s lies of fraud in the 2020 election that still buffet the state.  Still, Shapiro stressed that crossover support from Republican voters aided his victory against Mastriano, a far-right state senator who spread conspiracy theories, supported a complete ban on abortion and did more than any other gubernatorial candidate in the nation to subvert the 2020 presidential election. Pledging to manage the state\u2019s affairs with bipartisanship in mind, Shapiro said he has a \u201cmandate\u201d to bring people together and vowed to work with Republicans in the state Capitol. \u201cI think it\u2019s clear, you know, I\u2019m not going to get everything done that I want, and they\u2019re not going to get everything done they want,\u201d Shapiro said in an interview Friday on WILK-FM in Scranton. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot we can do together and that is what is going to be my focus.\u201d One conservative advocate, Leo Knepper, political director of the Citizens Alliance of Pennsylvania, said he worries that Republican lawmakers will shrug off conservative principles because of the size of Shapiro\u2019s victory. \u201cI think that some of these Republicans are going to have their eye to the fact that he won by a fairly significant margin and what did that margin look like in their districts,\u201d Knepper said. About 6 in 10 independents backed Shapiro in the election, compared with about 3 in 10 who supported Mastriano, according to AP VoteCast, an expansive survey of more than 3,100 voters in the state. Shapiro maintains that he will veto any legislation that he views as undermining abortion rights or voting rights. But, in a nod to the potential for Democrats to control the state House of Representatives, he told KYW-AM radio in Philadelphia that it appears that he \u201cwon\u2019t have to wield that veto pen much.\u201d The Associated Press has not called two state House races that will determine which party controls the majority. County election boards are expected to certify results later this week. Shapiro entered the race as a dominant figure in the state Democratic Party, a powerhouse fundraiser and polished speaker elected twice statewide \u2014 someone who even Republicans say is a talented politician. He unified the Democratic Party, its leaders and its allies behind his candidacy, cleared the primary of challengers and ran to the middle on key issues, including on energy in the nation\u2019s No. 2 natural gas state. He broke with Wolf\u2019s top climate-change priority, a quest bitterly opposed by Republicans to make Pennsylvania the first major fossil fuel state to impose carbon-pricing.  He proposed a big corporate income tax cut and opened the door to Republican plans to allow broader state funding of private and parochial schools. And he rejected Wolf\u2019s COVID-19 policies, saying he would not order mask mandates or business shutdowns in a pandemic \u2014 even though his office had defended them in court. In post-election interviews, he stressed that he will focus on his core priorities of improving schools, safety and the economy. Shapiro also must assemble a Cabinet and name a replacement to finish the last two years of his term as Pennsylvania\u2019s top law enforcement officer. Shapiro will take office with the state in a stable financial position, thanks to strong tax collections and billions in federal pandemic aid.  Still, the state Supreme Court is considering a legal challenge to how the state funds public schools, a lawsuit that could impose major changes on how the state distributes billions of dollars in school funding. He will be in the middle of the fight over climate change, facing pressure from environmental advocates to crack down on planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, while labor unions \u2014 their members work on power plants, pipelines and refineries \u2014 say he promised not to block major new gas infrastructure projects. Shapiro also will have to navigate a partisan fight over updating Pennsylvania\u2019s voting laws, which has dominated the state Capitol the past two years.  Many Republicans on the campaign trail \u2014 including Mastriano and nearly every other candidate in the GOP gubernatorial primary \u2014 called for the repeal of no-excuse mail-in voting in Pennsylvania.  For his part, Shapiro said he will pursue changes to voting laws \u2014 Election Day voter registration and automatic voter registration \u2014 that have seen no traction in the Republican-controlled Legislature. With Pennsylvania certain to be a battleground in the 2024 presidential election, the focus on election laws isn\u2019t fading.  On Sunday, Mastriano conceded, issuing a statement that acknowledged his defeat and asked his supporters to give Shapiro the opportunity to lead.  But, he also said work must be done on elections to make them \u201ctransparent, secure and more quickly decided.\u201d \u201cPennsylvanians deserve to have faith in our elections,\u201d Mastriano said. ___ Associated Press reporter Nuha Dolby in New York contributed to this report.

    "US, Cubans will meet again in Havana: State Department": [
        "By MATTHEW LEE and MEGAN JANETSKYNovember 15, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 U.S. and Cuban officials plan to meet in Havana on Tuesday to discuss migration policy, the latest in a series of sessions between two governments with a historically icy relationship and amid one of the biggest migratory flights from the island in decades. The State Department on Monday confirmed the latest meeting to The Associated Press. While the department did not offer specifics on what would be discussed, it said the talks were routine and represent a continuation of a nearly 30-year engagement with Cuba on migration matters as neighboring states. The talks were limited to migration, the State Department said. U.S. authorities stopped Cubans nearly 221,000 times in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, a 471% increase from the year before, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. In October, Cubans replaced Venezuelans as the second-largest nationality after Mexicans, extending the biggest flight from the Caribbean island to the United States since the Mariel boatlift in 1980, according to figures released late Monday. Cubans were stopped 28,848 times, up 10% from September. The mass migration is fueled by a complex mix of economic and political turmoil exacerbated by a deepening energy crisis and devastation wrought by Hurricane Ian in late September. Last Wednesday, State Department officials traveled to Cuba to discuss the expansion of consular and visa services with Cuban officials. Those services were previously closed following a series of health incidents in 2017.  The Biden administration also announced that visa processing would resume in January. Tuesday\u2019s meeting represents a slow thawing of a relationship that has always been tense, but has been particularly strained since President Donald Trump tightened American sanctions on the island. A U.S. official who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity said Cuba has agreed to receive one flight of deported Cuban migrants from the U.S. It would be the first flight since the beginning of the pandemic, potentially offering American authorities a tool to deter Cuban border crossers. U.S. officials, the official said, hope more will come out of the Havana talks as the exodus from the island has no end in sight. ___ Janetsky reported from Havana.

    "Israel Defense Minister: US probes Shireen Abu Akleh killing": [
        "By ISABEL DEBRENovember 15, 2022 GMT",
        " JERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 Israel\u2019s Defense Minister Benny Gantz said Monday the U.S. Department of Justice has decided to investigate the fatal shooting of Palestinian-American Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, condemning the probe as a \u201cgrave mistake\u201d and vowing not to cooperate. A Justice Department spokesman had no comment and there were no details about when an investigation might begin and what it would entail, nor what the ramifications of it might be. But an FBI probe into Israeli actions would be a rare, if not unprecedented, step. An American investigation would follow months of pressure from Abu Akleh\u2019s family and U.S. lawmakers disappointed with the inconclusive findings of a previous State Department assessment and Israeli military investigation into the death of the prominent correspondent last May. Abu Akleh\u2019s supporters accuse Israel of intentionally killing the 51-year-old, and have urged Washington to open a full investigation. But a probe risks straining the strong partnership between the U.S. and Israel at a time when Israel is bracing for the formation of its most right-wing government in history and as progressive Democrats in the U.S. have called for a more skeptical stance toward one of Washington\u2019s closest allies. It would directly challenge Israel\u2019s claims that it properly holds its soldiers to account for their actions in the Palestinian territories. Gantz lambasted what he described as a decision to open a U.S. Justice Department probe into Abu Akleh\u2019s killing, saying on Twitter that Israel has made it clear to the U.S. that it \u201cwon\u2019t cooperate with any external investigation.\u201d  \u201cWe will not allow interference in Israel\u2019s internal affairs,\u201d he added. Gantz, who is set to leave his post following elections earlier this month that vaulted Israel\u2019s former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu back to power, served as defense minister when Abu Akleh was killed. A Palestinian from Jerusalem who covered Israeli operations in the occupied West Bank for a quarter century, Abu Akleh was a household name among many Arabs in the Middle East. Her death sparked outrage across the world, throwing a spotlight on Israeli treatment of the Palestinians. Palestinian officials, Abu Akleh\u2019s family and Al Jazeera accuse Israel of intentionally targeting the veteran reporter. She was wearing a helmet and a protective vest marked with the word \u201cpress\u201d when she was shot while covering an Israeli military raid in the Jenin refugee camp.  In September, Israel acknowledged for the first time that Israeli fire probably killed Abu Akleh. But the military stopped short of accepting responsibility for her death, vigorously denying allegations that a soldier targeted her and refusing to criminally investigate those involved.  An earlier assessment from the State Department also determined that the bullet that killed Abu Akleh was likely fired from an Israeli military position but was too damaged to say with certainty. A series of independent investigations by the United Nations and international media outlets, including by The Associated Press, found that Israeli troops most likely fired the fatal bullet.  Palestinian Foreign Ministry officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment late Monday about the U.S probe. A spokeswoman for outgoing Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid declined to comment, and former Prime Minister Netanyahu, who is expected to return to lead the country in the coming weeks, also had no immediate comment. Abu Akleh\u2019s brother, Tony Abu Akleh, told Al Jazeera the family was optimistic about reports of a U.S. investigation, saying it\u2019s \u201cvery important to hold those responsible accountable and prevent similar crimes.\u201d \u201cWe hope this will be a turning point in the investigation into Shireen\u2019s death,\u201d he said. The Council on American-Islamic Relations welcomed the reported probe, expressing hope \u201cour nation will finally hold Israel accountable for its violence targeting American citizens, journalists and other civilians.\u201d It is not unusual for the FBI or other U.S. investigators to mount probes into non-natural deaths or injuries of American citizens abroad, particularly if they are government employees. However, such separate investigations are not the rule and it is exceedingly rare for them to occur in a U.S.-allied country like Israel that is recognized in Washington as having a credible and independent judicial system.  Human rights groups have long accused the Israeli military of failing to properly investigate wrongdoing by its own troops and seldom holding forces accountable. Israel contends its investigations are independent and professional. Abu Akleh was shot while reporting on an Israeli military raid in the Jenin refugee camp in the northern West Bank, long a flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel\u2019s escalating nightly arrest operations, launched following a spate of Palestinian attacks against Israelis in the spring that killed 19 people, have been concentrated in Jenin and nearby areas. More than 130 Palestinians in east Jerusalem and the West Bank have been killed this year, making 2022 the deadliest year since 2006. Israel says most of those killed have been militants, but local youth protesting the raids as well as people not involved in the fighting have also been killed. Increasing Israeli incursions have prompted a series of Palestinian shooting attacks that have killed at least four Israelis in recent weeks. Reports of a U.S. probe come after long-serving Netanyahu secured a return to power in Israel\u2019s national elections. He is in the midst of talks with his ultra-Orthodox and ultranationalist allies to form a coalition and is expected to cobble together Israel\u2019s most right-wing government in history. The government, which is expected to see extremist lawmakers appointed to key ministries, has prompted concern among Israel\u2019s allies, including the U.S. ___ Associated Press writers Tia Goldenberg in Tel Aviv, Israel, and Matthew Lee in Washington contributed.",

    "Cubans, Nicaraguans drive illegal border crossings higher": [
        "By ELLIOT SPAGATNovember 15, 2022 GMT",
        " SAN DIEGO (AP) \u2014 U.S. authorities stopped migrants more than 230,000 times on the Mexican border in October, the third-highest month of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency amid growing numbers from Cuba, Nicaragua, Colombia and other countries. Fewer Venezuelans came after the the Biden administration introduced new asylum restrictions on Oct. 12, but increasing arrivals from other countries more than offset that decline, according to figures released late Monday. Authorities stopped migrants 230,678 times last month, up 1.4% from 227,547 in September and the highest since May, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said. Cubans replaced Venezuelans as the second-largest nationality after Mexicans, extending the biggest flight from the Caribbean island to the United States since the Mariel boatlift in 1980.  Cubans were stopped 28,848 times, up 10% from September. Their presence is a major concern for U.S. officials, who arrived in Havana on Monday for talks with Cuban officials on migration.  Venezuelans were the third-largest nationality as flows diminished after Oct. 12, when Mexico began accepting Venezuelans who enter the U.S. illegally and are expelled under a Trump-era rule that denies rights to seek asylum on grounds of preventing spread of COVID-19. CBP said Venezuelan arrivals fell to about 300 a day by the end of October from about 1,100 before the new restrictions. Nicaraguans were the fourth-largest nationality, closely behind Venezuelans. They were stopped 20,917 times, up 15% from September. The numbers were released two days after the forced resignation of Chris Magnus as commissioner of the largest law enforcement agency in the United States. The former Tucson, Arizona, police chief had been on the job less than a year. \u201cEncounters of Cuban and Nicaraguan asylum seekers fleeing their authoritarian regimes continues to be at an historic high,\u201d said Troy Miller, acting CBP commissioner. \u201cThis reflects the challenge that is gripping the hemisphere, as displaced populations flee authoritarianism, corruption, violence, and poverty.\u201d There were fewer migrants from Guatemalan and Honduras \u2014 countries that have historically sent large numbers \u2014 but more came from other parts of the world. Colombians were stopped 17,195 times, the fifth highest, up 25% from September. Amid the war in Ukraine, Russians were stopped 3,879 times, up 48% from September. Nearly 80,000 migrants were expelled in October under the pandemic-related asylum ban known as Title 42, bringing total expulsions to more than 2.4 million since March 2000. The rule has been applied most heavily on nationalities that Mexico accepts. Aside from Mexicans, Mexico admits Guatemalans, Hondurans, El Salvadorans and, most recently, Venezuelans.",

    "McCarthy makes case for House speaker, but right flank balks": [
        "By LISA MASCARO and FARNOUSH AMIRINovember 15, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 With Republicans close to gaining control of the House, Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy maneuvered Monday to lock up support to become the next House speaker, pushing past the objections of his right flank and embarking on a bruising path to seize the gavel from Nancy Pelosi if Democrats lose the majority. House Republicans met behind closed doors late in the day to hear the pitch from McCarthy, who reaches for the speaker\u2019s gavel at a tumultuous time for the party.  Late Monday, Republicans were just one victory shy of the 218 seats the party needs to secure a majority.  Leaders on Capitol Hill face a backlash over their disappointing performance in the midterm elections, which some blame on Donald Trump, as Republicans reassess their relationship with the former president. Trump is poised to announce his 2024 bid for the White House on Tuesday, the same day as the House GOP leadership elections.  McCarthy exited the two-hour meeting appearing confident ahead of Tuesday\u2019s internal party vote \u2014 a crucial first test. \u201cThe one thing you got to think about is it\u2019s going to be a tight majority so everyone is going to have to work together,\u201d McCarthy said.  \u201cWe\u2019ll be successful as a team and we\u2019ll be defeated as an individual if we don\u2019t all work together,\u201d he said. The GOP leadership elections arrive at an inflection point for the Republican Party after the dismal election. McCarthy had promised big wins, with the most diverse class ever of Republican recruits, but voters rejected many of more extreme candidates and election deniers beholden to Trump. Instead, Republicans limped toward the 218 seats needed for a majority.  It\u2019s not just McCarthy\u2019s leadership that is in question ahead of Tuesday\u2019s party votes \u2014 his entire team, including Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., the campaign chairman, faces blowback from the party\u2019s losses. Across the Capitol, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell is also encountering opposition from his right flank ahead of his own leadership election Wednesday. Tuesday\u2019s vote is a first step in McCarthy\u2019s pursuit of the gavel, ahead of the more formal vote when the new Congress convenes in January. The weeks ahead promise to be a grueling period of hardball negotiations between McCarthy and rank-and-file Republicans as he tries to appease their demands and rack up the support he will need in the new year.  \u201cI don\u2019t just automatically assume heir apparent, necessarily,\u201d said Rep. Steve Womack, R-Ark., who said he is still studying his choice for House speaker, a position second in line to the president. \u201cWe are voting for somebody who is going to be two heartbeats from the presidency,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me that automatically makes this one of the most important votes you\u2019ll take as a member of Congress.\u201d Republicans are torn in the Trump era between those remaining loyal to the former president and those who blame him for the midterm losses and prefer to move on from his \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d brand. Some lawmakers begged off from joining Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida for his announcement Tuesday because of their own work on Capitol Hill. The former president backs McCarthy for speaker, but the two have had a rocky relationship. Even Trump\u2019s support is no guarantee McCarthy will reach the 218 votes needed to become speaker. The conservative Freedom Caucus lawmakers who typically align with Trump are demanding concessions from McCarthy before giving him their backing. They have have a long list of asks \u2014 from prime positions on House committees to guarantees they can have a role in shaping legislation.  \u201cI\u2019m willing to support anybody that\u2019s willing to change dramatically how things are done here,\u201d Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., the chairman of the Freedom Caucus and a Trump ally, said after meeting privately with McCarthy. It\u2019s a familiar dynamic for House Republicans, one that befell their most recent Republican speakers \u2014 John Boehner and Paul Ryan \u2014 who both retired early rather than try to lead a party splintered by its far-right flank. McCarthy survived those earlier battles between party factions, but the 57-year-old was forced to back out of an earlier bid for the speaker\u2019s job in 2015 when it was clear he did not have support from conservatives.  Asked what will happen if he can\u2019t get to 218 votes from his colleagues, McCarthy touched back to those earlier campaigns for the gavel. \u201cAsk Paul Ryan. Ask everyone who ran for speaker before. Nobody has had 218,\u201d McCarthy said. If Republicans succeed in wining majority control of the House once final votes are tallied from the midterm election, it will likely be by the slimmest of margins. That means McCarthy will have little room to maneuver or make deals with the various factions in the GOP because virtually every vote will be needed to move the party\u2019s agenda. McCarthy huddled privately with several Freedom Caucus members ahead of Monday\u2019s session, and appeared to answer many of their questions later as he spoke at the leadership forum.  While newly elected lawmakers arrived for orientation Monday, there are questions over who, exactly, will be voting Tuesday \u2014 with some of the House races still undecided. He needs to clear a simple majority Tuesday, ahead of the formal vote for speaker in January, once the new Congress convenes. \u201cLeader McCarthy said, \u2018We\u2019re going to run the House in the way that you want me to run it,\u2019\u201d Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., said as he exited the meeting. Issa said McCarthy drew applause when he suggested he would do as Democrats did in booting certain lawmakers off their committees. Democrats had forced conservative Reps. Marjorie Taylor Green and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., off their committees over their incendiary remarks. \u201cHe will not be afraid to make those decisions, if appropriately brought to him,\u201d Issa said. With no one rising to challenge McCarthy, veteran lawmakers said if McCarthy is able to clear the majority in Tuesday\u2019s vote, they hope the naysayers fall in line. \u201cYou just would hope that people respect the will of the conference, and I think it\u2019d be pretty overwhelming tomorrow what that will is,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla. Of McCarthy, he said: \u201cHe\u2019s our best strategist. He\u2019s our best fundraiser. He\u2019s our best candidate recruiter. Isn\u2019t that the guy you want to lead you? I think so.\u201d ___ Associated Press writer Kevin Freking contributed to this report. ___ Follow the AP\u2019s coverage of the 2022 midterm elections at https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections.

    "GOP on cusp of retaking House control with slim majority": [
        "By WILL WEISSERTNovember 15, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Republicans were on the cusp of retaking control of the House late Monday, just one victory shy of the 218 seats the party needs to secure a majority, narrowing the path for Democrats to keep the chamber and raising the prospect of a divided government in Washington. Democrats have already won control of the Senate, securing 50 seats with a runoff in Georgia next month that could give President Joe Biden\u2019s party an additional seat. The GOP came into the election needing to gain a net of just five seats for House control.  Nearly a week after the midterm elections, Republicans were closing in on the majority, giving conservatives leverage to blunt Biden\u2019s agenda and spur a flurry of investigations. But a slim numerical advantage will pose immediate challenges for GOP leaders and complicate the party\u2019s ability to govern.  The full scope of the party\u2019s majority may not be clear for several more days \u2014 or weeks \u2014 as votes in competitive races are still being counted. Still, the party was on track to achieve 218 with seats in California and other states still too early to call.  Even barely achieving 218, though, means Republicans will likely have the narrowest majority of the 21st century. It could rival 2001, when Republicans had just a nine-seat majority, 221-212 with two independents. That\u2019s far short of the sweeping victory Republicans predicted going into this year\u2019s midterm elections, when the party hoped to reset the agenda on Capitol Hill by capitalizing on economic challenges and Biden\u2019s lagging popularity.  Instead, Democrats were able to largely blunt an expected big GOP election, holding on to moderate, suburban districts from Virginia to Minnesota and Kansas. The results could complicate House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy\u2019s plans to become speaker as some conservative members have questioned whether to back him or have imposed conditions for their support. The narrow margins have upended Republican politics and prompted finger-pointing about what went wrong. Some in the GOP have blamed Donald Trump for the worse-than-expected outcome. The former president, who is expected to announce a third White House bid on Tuesday, lifted candidates during this year\u2019s primaries who struggled to win during the general election. Despite its underwhelming showing, the GOP will still see its power in Washington grow. Republicans will take control of House committees, giving them the ability to shape legislation and launch probes of Biden, his family and his administration.  There\u2019s particular interest in investigating the overseas business dealings of the president\u2019s son Hunter Biden. Some of the most conservative lawmakers have raised the prospect of impeaching Biden, though that will be much harder for the party to accomplish with a tight majority. Any legislation that emerges from the House could face steep odds in the Senate, where the narrow Democratic majority will often be enough to derail GOP-championed legislation.  With such a slim majority in the House, there\u2019s a potential for legislative chaos. The dynamic essentially gives an individual member enormous sway over shaping what happens in the chamber. That could lead to particularly tricky circumstances for GOP leaders as they try to win support for must-pass measures that keep the government funded or raise the debt ceiling. The GOP\u2019s failure to notch more gains was especially surprising because the party went into the election benefiting from congressional maps that were redrawn by Republican legislatures. History was also on Republicans\u2019 side: The party that holds the White House had lost congressional seats during virtually every new president\u2019s first midterm of the modern era.  If elected to succeed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in the top post, McCarthy would lead what will likely be a rowdy conference of House Republicans, most of whom are aligned with Trump\u2019s bare-knuckle brand of politics. Many Republicans in the incoming Congress rejected the results of the 2020 presidential election, even though claims of widespread fraud were refuted by courts, elections officials and Trump\u2019s own attorney general. In the first national election since the Jan. 6 insurrection, one Republican who was outside the Capitol on the day of the mob attack, Derrick Van Orden, won a House seat. He won a seat long held by Democrats in Wisconsin. Republican candidates pledged on the campaign trail to cut taxes and tighten border security. GOP lawmakers also could withhold aid to Ukraine as it fights a war with Russia or use the threat of defaulting on the nation\u2019s debt as leverage to extract cuts from social spending and entitlements \u2014 though all such pursuits will be tougher given how small the GOP majority may end up being.  As a senator and then vice president, Biden spent a career crafting legislative compromises with Republicans. But as president, he was clear about what he viewed as the threats posed by the current Republican Party. Biden said the midterms show voters want Democrats and Republicans to find ways to cooperate and govern in a bipartisan manner, but also noted that Republicans didn\u2019t achieve the electoral surge they\u2019d been betting on and vowed, \u201cI\u2019m not going to change anything in any fundamental way.\u201d The president was also blunt in assessing his party\u2019s dwindling chances, saying Monday of the House, \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be very close, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to make it.\u201d",

    "Why AP called the Arizona\u2019s governor race for Katie Hobbs": [
        "By MEG KINNARDNovember 15, 2022 GMT",
        " The Associated Press called the Arizona governor\u2019s race for Democrat Katie Hobbs on Monday after the latest round of vote releases gave her a lead that AP determined she would not relinquish. The AP concluded that, even though Republican Kari Lake had been posting increasingly larger margins in vote updates from Maricopa County, she was not gaining a big enough share to overtake Hobbs, and was running out of remaining votes. Vote counting had gone on for days since the Tuesday election, as officials continued to tally massive amounts of late-arriving ballots.  As of Monday night, there were 43,000 remaining votes to count in Arizona, according to state officials, including more than 17,000 early ballots. Hobbs gained prominence defending the state\u2019s elections work after Joe Biden\u2019s contentious win there over Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential race. Lake, a former TV broadcaster, cast doubts on the outcome of that election, without evidence. Some Republican activists in Arizona had advocated that voters intentionally wait until Election Day itself to drop off their ballots. Some of this push was based on unfounded theories that fraudsters could manipulate voting systems and rig results for Democrats, once they had seen how many GOP votes had been returned early. Experts had warned that such a last-minute crush of ballots could end up creating delays. Lake made a number of media appearances complaining that Maricopa was \u201cslow-rolling\u201d results and \u2014 without evidence \u2014 called the state\u2019s vote count \u201cbotched,\u201d prompting Maricopa\u2019s Republican elections chief to rebuke her. Regardless, Lake asserted her confidence that the results would turn in her favor. Hobbs urged patience as the count continued. TALLYING TIMELINE Almost all of Arizona\u2019s vote happens by mail, although some voters cast their ballots in-person at voting centers. Most Arizona counties don\u2019t count ballots in-house, with officials instead bringing them to a central facility. Early votes in Arizona can be counted as they come in, meaning that officials don\u2019t have to wait until polls close on Election Day to start. Arizona officials release their vote totals in batches. Much of the focus has been on Maricopa, the state\u2019s largest county, with a total of 4.5 million residents \u2014 more than half of Arizona\u2019s total population \u2014 and about 2.4 million registered voters. But other big releases have been coming from Arizona\u2019s next two most populated counties: Pima (home to Tucson) and Pinal, a large, suburban area just south of metro Phoenix. Here\u2019s the situation so far, starting with the most recent information: MONDAY, NOV. 14 \u2014MARICOPA: Maricopa County\u2019s more than 71,000 votes released Monday favored Lake over Hobbs, 57 percentage points to 43. \u2014PIMA: A batch of 31,000 votes released Monday by Pima County broke for Hobbs over Lake by a margin of 58 percentage points to 42. \u2014PINAL: In a batch of nearly 19,000 votes from Pinal County, Lake had about a 28 percentage point edge on Hobbs. After Monday\u2019s vote updates, Hobbs led Lake by more than 20,000 votes overall. SUNDAY, NOV. 13 \u2014MARICOPA: Maricopa County\u2019s Sunday night batch of about 97,000 votes broke for Lake by nearly 10 percentage points. That left about 94,000 votes left to tally in Maricopa. \u2014PIMA: On Sunday, Pima County released nearly 12,000 votes, which favored Hobbs over Lake by a 3-to-2 margin. \u2014PINAL: An 8,500-vote batch released Sunday from Pinal County favored Lake over Hobbs by about 10 percentage points. SATURDAY, NOV. 12 \u2014MARICOPA: On Saturday, Maricopa County officials released a batch of nearly 85,000 votes, which broke just slightly over half for Lake. \u2014PIMA: In a nearly 20,000-vote batch released Saturday by Pima County, Hobbs had a nearly 30 percentage point edge on Lake. Officials also said they planned no vote release for Pima County on Sunday. Pinal County did not release vote totals on Friday or Saturday. FRIDAY, NOV. 11 \u2014MARICOPA: At around 10 p.m. Eastern Time on Friday, officials in Maricopa released another batch of 75,000 votes, a tranche that provided enough information for AP to determine that Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly had won reelection against Republican Blake Masters. But there still was not enough for AP to call a winner in the governor\u2019s race. The batch favored Hobbs over Lake by less than 10 percentage points. \u2014PIMA: Pima County\u2019s Friday votes totaled nearly 25,000 and favored Hobbs over Lake by nearly 2-to-1. Officials said they had only about 6,000 regular ballots left to verify on Saturday. THURSDAY, NOV. 10 \u2014MARICOPA: On Thursday, Maricopa County reported a total of 78,000 votes, in a batch that favored Hobbs by 10 percentage points. \u2014PIMA: Pima County released vote loads totaling about 32,000 on Thursday, favoring Hobbs by about 30 percentage points. \u2014PINAL: Pinal County\u2019s Thursday vote release of about 8,500 favored Lake by around 10 percentage points. WEDNESDAY, NOV. 9 \u2014MARICOPA: On Wednesday evening, Maricopa County officials released their first batch of vote totals, figures that didn\u2019t include any of the 275,000 early ballots received on Election Day. In all, Maricopa officials said they processed a record number \u2014 290,000 \u2014 of these ballots known as \u201clate earlies,\u201d the counting of which has been known to hold up tabulation. In all, Maricopa officials reported a total of 225,065 votes, favoring Lake by more than 30 percentage points. \u2014PIMA: Pima County\u2019s Wednesday vote releases totaled nearly 83,000, with Lake outperforming Hobbs by more than 20 percentage points. \u2014PINAL: The Wednesday vote releases from Pinal County totaled around 75,000, favoring Lake by more than 20 percentage points. TUESDAY, NOV. 8 \u2014MARICOPA: On Election Day, nearly 837,000 votes came in from Maricopa County, favoring Hobbs over Lake by more than 10-point margins. \u2014PIMA: Pima County officials reported nearly 190,000 votes, in which Hobbs had a more than 2-to-1 edge on Lake. \u2014PINAL: Pinal County officials released nearly 38,000 votes, which were nearly evenly split between Hobbs and Lake. ___ Meg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP ___ Check out https://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-elections to learn more about the issues and factors at play in the 2022 midterm elections.

    "Hobbs wins Arizona governor\u2019s race, flipping state for Dems": [
        "By JONATHAN J. COOPERNovember 15, 2022 GMT",
        " PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 Democrat Katie Hobbs was elected Arizona governor on Monday, defeating an ally of Donald Trump who falsely claimed the 2020 election was rigged and refused to say she would accept the results of her race this year. Hobbs, who is Arizona\u2019s secretary of state, rose to prominence as a staunch defender of the legitimacy of the last election and warned that her Republican rival, former television news anchor Kari Lake, would be an agent of chaos. Hobbs\u2019 victory adds further evidence that Trump is weighing down his allies in a crucial battleground state as the former president gears up for an announcement of a 2024 presidential run. She will succeed Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, who was prohibited by term limit laws from running again. She\u2019s the first Democrat to be elected governor in Arizona since Janet Napolitano in 2006. \u201cFor the Arizonans who did not vote for me, I will work just as hard for you \u2014 because even in this moment of division, I believe there is so much more that connects us,\u201d Hobbs said in a statement declaring victory. \u201cThis was not just about an election \u2014 it was about moving this state forward and facing the challenges of our generation.\u201d Lake tweeted after the call, \u201cArizonans know BS when they see it.\u201d The Associated Press called the governor\u2019s race for Hobbs after the latest round of vote releases gave her a big enough lead that the AP determined she would not relinquish it. The AP concluded that, even though Lake had been posting increasingly larger margins in vote updates from Maricopa County, she was not gaining a big enough share to overtake Hobbs and was running out of remaining votes. Vote counting had gone on for days since the Tuesday election, as officials continued to tally massive amounts of late-arriving ballots. A onetime Republican stronghold where Democrats made gains during the Trump era, Arizona has been central to efforts by Trump and his allies to cast doubt on Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 presidential victory with false claims of fraud. This year, many Trump-endorsed candidates faltered in general elections in battleground states, though his pick in the Nevada governor\u2019s race, Republican Joe Lombardo, defeated an incumbent Democrat. Before entering politics, Hobbs was a social worker who worked with homeless youth and an executive with a large domestic violence shelter in the Phoenix area. She was elected to the state Legislature in 2010, serving one term in the House and three terms in the Senate, rising to minority leader. Hobbs eked out a narrow win in 2018 as secretary of state and was thrust into the center of a political storm as Arizona became the centerpiece of the efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the results of the 2020 election he lost. She appeared constantly on cable news defending the integrity of the vote count.  The attention allowed her to raise millions of dollars and raise her profile. When she announced her campaign for governor, other prominent Democrats declined to run and Hobbs comfortably won her primary.  She ran a cautious campaign, sticking largely to scripted and choreographed public appearances. She declined to participate in a debate with Lake, contending that Lake would turn it into a spectacle by spouting conspiracy theories and making false accusations.  She bet instead that voters would recoil against Lake, who picked verbal fights with journalists as cameras rolled and struck a combative tone toward Democrats and even the establishment Republicans who have long dominated state government. Pre-election polls showed the race was tied, but Hobbs\u2019 victory was still a surprise to many Democrats who feared her timidity would turn off voters. She overcame expectations in Maricopa and Pima counties, the metro Phoenix and Tucson areas where the overwhelming majority of Arizona voters live. She also spent considerable time in rural areas, looking to minimize her losses in regions that traditionally support Republicans.  Lake is well known in much of the state after anchoring the evening news in Phoenix for more than two decades. She ran as a fierce critic of the mainstream media, which she said is unfair to Republicans. She earned Trump\u2019s admiration for her staunch commitment to questioning the results of the 2020 election, a stand she never wavered from even after winning the GOP primary.  She baselessly accused election officials of slow-rolling the vote count this year and prioritizing Democratic ballots as she narrowly trailed Hobbs for days following the election. Lake has cited a problem with printers at about a third of Maricopa County vote centers that led on-site tabulators to reject some ballots. Election officials told voters to put ballots in a separate box to be counted later, but Republican leaders told their supporters to ignore that instruction and lines in some places backed up. The problem affected about 7% of ballots cast in person on Election Day and about 1% of the total cast in the county. Maricopa County Sheriff Paul Penzone said he increased security around the elections center Monday in anticipation that the race would be called and emotions could run hot, though he said there was no specific threat. Demonstrators have gathered outside the building for several days but have remained peaceful, he said. \u201cI think we\u2019re getting close to the end game so I want to be sure that we\u2019re prepared,\u201d Penzone told reporters in a news conference hours before the race call. The sheriff\u2019s office was caught off guard two years ago when armed and angry protesters descended on the elections building in downtown Phoenix after Fox News and the AP called Arizona for Biden, marking the first time a Democrat won the state in more than two decades. ___ Learn more about the issues and factors at play in the midterms at https://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-elections.

    "Arizona county quick to bat down election misinformation": [
        "By BOB CHRISTIENovember 15, 2022 GMT",
        " PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 When the Republican candidate for Arizona governor accused the state\u2019s most populous county of \u201cslow-rolling\u201d the vote count to skew early election results, a local official fired back. \u201cQuite frankly, it is offensive for Kari Lake to say that these people behind me are slow-rolling this, when they\u2019re working 14 to 18 hours\u201d every day, said Bill Gates, the Republican chairman of the Maricopa County board of supervisors. On Monday, Democrat Katie Hobbs defeated Lake, a Donald Trump ally who falsely claimed the 2020 election was rigged and has refused to say she would accept the results of her race this year. Gates and other Maricopa County election officials aggressively batted down rumors and slanted or false claims, as vote counting has come under intense scrutiny in the battleground state. The accusations have come in all types and at all hours from Trump and the former president\u2019s supporters, as well as other Republican candidates and voters.  \u201cSadly, there continues to be a lot of misinformation from all different sources that are out on social media right now,\u201d Gates said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have to continue to do this.\u201d Election officials have had two years to hone their game. In 2020, Maricopa County landed in the national spotlight while certifying results amid false claims that the election was stolen from Trump. The following year, it underwent an \u201caudit\u201d pushed by Republicans in the state Senate, which ended with a report validating Biden\u2019s win. \u201cThat was just a constant flow of misinformation that we became adept at responding to,\u201d Gates said.  In May, county officials began talking publicly about what to expect in the upcoming midterm elections. They have held regular news conferences since early October, and since Election Day officials have held briefings nearly every day. They also have a large public affairs team that can quickly respond to new or renewed claims of fraud or mismanagement.  One persistent claim started when Lake accused the county of \u201cslow-rolling\u201d the count. Lake and other Republicans said the county has timed vote releases so Democratic areas of the metro Phoenix area are released first. Gates has spent days explaining how that\u2019s not happening and is not possible. In truth, the county processes ballots using a first-in, first out system. That means mail-in ballots that are dropped off at the polls on Election Day are processed in the order they are received at the county\u2019s election headquarters.  \u201cThat\u2019s how we do this,\u201d Gates said Saturday. \u201cWe\u2019re not picking them from certain parts of town. In fact, we can\u2019t do that, because we have a vote center model.\u201d Vote centers mean any voter can walk into any polling place across the metro area to cast a ballot in-person or drop off their early ballots. And because ballots dropped off at vote centers are kept together for processing, the votes could be from anywhere. He called the allegations \u201cirrelevant\u201d and an \u201cincredible distraction.\u201d A record 290,000 of those ballots were dropped off at the county\u2019s 223 vote centers on Election Day and are now being processed. As of Monday morning, the county had between 185,000 and 195,000 ballots to count, while nearly 1.4 million in-person and early ballots had been tabulated.  Gates said the audit taught the board and other county leaders the importance of battling misinformation quickly and accurately. He and county Recorder Stephen Richer have taken the lead, with Democratic Sheriff Paul Penzone also taking the podium at times. Gates is a lawyer who for years represented the GOP during county elections. Penzone said the constant unfounded claims have forced Gates and Richer to spend an inordinate amount of time explaining why they are wrong. \u201cWhat\u2019s the saying, a lie travels around the world \u2026 10,000 times before the truth even gets started?\u201d Penzone said Saturday. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing here. We\u2019re seeing people empowered by saying things that make them feel good, and they\u2019re not accountable for it, and they lie.\u201d  David Becker, a former U.S. Justice Department lawyer who now runs the nonprofit Center for Election Innovation and Research, praised county election officials and Gates in particular for their rapid and consistent responses. \u201cThey\u2019re doing an outstanding job,\u201d Becker said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, I think Bill Gates and his colleagues have been the best of American governance, not just in the last week, but over the course of the past several years while they\u2019ve been running elections in Maricopa County.\u201d The Republican Party of Arizona has complained about Election Day issues and the prolonged vote count, which is normal in Arizona. Party Chair Kelli Ward complained about ballot-counting machines that could not always read the ballots. The 17,000 affected ballots were instead taken to the county\u2019s central facility. Black bags of those ballots were stacked for processing Monday.  Not every claim is a lie, but the accusations have answers that make sense. On Friday night, losing Republican U.S. Senate candidate Blake Masters accused the county of mixing up counted ballots with those that could not be tabulated by the vote center machines at least twice. He demanded that the more than 1.4 million ballots that had already been tabulated be recounted, calling it a \u201cgiant disaster.\u201d Megan Gilbertson, spokeswoman for the county elections department, told The Associated Press that election workers at two vote centers did combine voted ballots with a batch that could not be read by the on-site tabulators, but that the mix-up did not lead to double-counted or uncounted ballots because the department has systems in place to deal with such occurrences. \u201cBecause ballots are tabulated by batch, we are able to isolate the results from those specific locations and reconcile the total ballots against check-ins to ensure it matches,\u201d she wrote less than two hours after Masters made the statement. \u201cThis is done with political party observers present and is a practice that has been in place for decades.\u201d ___ Learn more about the issues and factors at play in the midterms at https://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-elections",

(AP) \u2014 The Nevada Supreme Court denied an emergency writ from two voting rights groups on Monday that sought to shut down a controversial hand-count of all paper ballots in rural Nye County, meaning that the county clerk can continue the hand-counting of ballots that have been counted by machine tabulators. \u201cHaving reviewed the petition and answer, we conclude that petitioner has not demonstrated that our extraordinary intervention is warranted at this time,\u201d the justices said in their decision. Officials in the county first started a hand-counting process on Oct. 26 but the Nevada Supreme Court ordered it shut down a day later, siding with the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s objections to volunteers reading election results aloud. Nye County resumed a revised version of its hand-counting last week after Republican Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske ordered the county to halt its counting until after polls closed.  While Nye County commission members have shown support for scrapping voting machines completely, machine tabulators are the primary counting method for this election, and Nye has already reported the results of nearly 21,000 ballots cast. Nye County, home to about 34,000 registered voters, is the most prominent county in the U.S. to change its vote-counting process in reaction to conspiracy theories about election fraud tied to voting machines, though there has been no credible evidence of widespread fraud or manipulation of machines. An Arizona county is also embroiled in a legal battle over whether it can conduct a near-total hand-count of ballots after Election Day. As the hand-counting resumed last Thursday, interim county clerk Mark Kampf told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that it would act as an audit of the machines.  In their lawsuit filed Monday, the ACLU of Nevada and Brennan Center for Justice argued the interim county clerk there is \u201cinventing\u201d an unauthorized hand-counting practice that was not legally vetted.  Nye County\u2019s new hand-counting plans, submitted after the previous plans were scrapped, were not submitted by the deadline of 90 days before the general election, they mentioned. While their original plans were submitted by the deadline, the hand-count process was revised and reworked the previous week into a new system. The organizations also say that the new location where Nye County is hand-counting ballots was not approved, further undermining the \u201csecurity and integrity\u201d of the vote count.  The petition also argues that the county\u2019s plan does not meet the statutory requirement for a recount, audit or contest of an election.  While the court acknowledged that a \u201csignificant portion\u201d of the petition said that the county violated the secretary of state\u2019s regulations, they noted that the hand-count plan was approved by the secretary of state on Nov. 5. Nye County also contacted the secretary of state\u2019s office on Nov. 7 with the plans. The organizations also raised \u201ca number of fact issues\u201d regarding the hand-count process and location change, that would need to be decided in a district court. \u201cAs we have repeatedly emphasized, this is not a fact-finding court,\u201d the justices said. The court noted that the organizations did not put Nevada\u2019s secretary of state as a defendant, despite the organizations claiming the office did not follow its own regulations when approving the hand-count. And, because of Nye County\u2019s hand-count acting as a secondary measure to its machine tally, they could revise the hand-count process later than 90 days before the election.  The filings are the latest development in a conflict between the rural county\u2019s election administration and the ACLU that has spawned lawsuits, complaints to the secretary of state\u2019s office and a series of Nevada Supreme Court rulings that have fundamentally altered Nye County\u2019s plan for its parallel hand-count. Under the revised hand-counting plan the county is using, volunteers wearing gloves sit in groups of three, each tallying one ballot at a time, then passing them on to the next worker. Another volunteer checks that all three reviewers counted the same number of votes. Nye County spokesperson Arnold Knightly said the county would not comment on the initial filing. Athar Haseebullah, executive director of the ACLU of Nevada, said in a statement that the organization was \u201cdisappointed\u201d in the courts decision, but was looking forward to working with a new secretary of state and Legislature \u201cto make sure our democracy isn\u2019t undermined by conspiracy theorists interested in growing their political power.\u201d Kampf, the county clerk who is running the hand-count, has repeated false claims that the results of the 2020 election. There are 658 jurisdictions in the contiguous U.S. \u2014 mostly small townships across New England and rural Wisconsin \u2014 that rely exclusively on hand-counting, with the vast majority having fewer than 2,000 registered voters, according to data from Verified Voting, a group that tracks voting equipment across states. The most populous county in the U.S. to use only hand-counting is Owyhee County, Idaho, which had 6,315 registered voters as of 2020. ___ Stern is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

    "Federal inmate tried to shoot visitor at Arizona prison camp": [
        "By MICHAEL BALSAMO and MICHAEL R. SISAKNovember 15, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A federal prison inmate who was able to obtain a firearm at a prison camp in Arizona pulled out the gun in a visitation area and attempted to shoot a visitor in the head, The Associated Press has learned.  The weapon misfired and the female visitor was uninjured in Sunday\u2019s incident at the Federal Correctional Institution in Tucson. The incident marked a major security lapse and massive breach of protocol, raising serious questions about the security practices in place at the Bureau of Prisons, which is responsible for more than 150,000 federal inmates.  The Bureau of Prisons tells the AP that the inmate attempted to fire the weapon, which had been concealed in the prison. But the weapon did not fire and no one was injured.  The incident happened at a minimum-security federal prison camp \u2014 most of which don\u2019t even have fences and house inmates the Bureau of Prisons considers to be the lowest security risk. Officials said the inmate was restrained and the firearm was seized. Federal officials have launched an investigation.  The Bureau of Prisons has been plagued by chronic mismanagement, misconduct and a severe staffing crisis. A new director was brought on earlier this year as Justice Department officials attempt to reform the agency.  Federal prison camps were originally designed with low security to make operations easier and to allow inmates tasked with performing work at the prison, like landscaping and maintenance, to avoid repeatedly checking in and out of a main prison facility. But the lax security opened a gateway for contraband, such as drugs, cellphones and weapons.",
