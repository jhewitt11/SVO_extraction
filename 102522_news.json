    "Most Candidates Who Think 2020 Was Rigged Are Probably Going To Win In November": [
        "By Kaleigh Rogers",
        " In May, Anna Paulina Luna donned a red-carpet-worthy ball gown to a screening of \u201c2000 Mules,\u201d a debunked documentary that falsely claims to show evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. In June, she made her stance on the 2020 election clear in an interview with MSNBC: \u201cI believe that President Trump won that election, and I do believe that voter fraud occurred.\u201d And in November, she will very likely be elected to Congress.  Luna is the Republican candidate for Florida\u2019s 13th District, on the Gulf Coast around St. Petersburg. During redistricting last year, Republicans redrew this previously competitive district to be much redder, and as a result, Luna has a 97-in-100 shot at beating her Democrat opponent, according to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Deluxe forecast, as of Monday at 12 p.m. Eastern. (All numbers in this story are as of that same time and date.) Luna is one of well over a hundred of candidates running this fall who have denied the legitimacy of the 2020 election1 and have a strong chance of winning their race. Of the 185 Republican candidates running for House, Senate and governor\u2019s seats who have denied the legitimacy of the 2020 election, 124 \u2014 or 67 percent \u2014 are in races our forecast currently pins at \u201cSolid R,\u201d meaning they have a 95-in-100 or better chance of winning. Overall, a bigger share of election deniers are running in Solid R races than Republican candidates in general: Of the 496 Republican candidates running for House, Senate and governor, 225 \u2014 or 45 percent \u2014 are in Solid R races.2  Election-denying candidates running to become House representatives are faring better than those running to be governor or Senator. There are 170 election deniers running for House seats, and 70 percent (119) are running in Solid R races. Among the seven running for governor, only two \u2014 Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey and Idaho Gov. Brad Little \u2014 are running in Solid R races. And of the eight election deniers running for Senate, just three \u2014 Katie Britt in Alabama, Eric Schmitt in Missouri and Markwayne Mullin in Oklahoma\u2019s special election \u2014 have better than 95-in-100 odds.  A sizable portion of election-denying candidates are also running in races where they\u2019re very unlikely to win. Thirty-six election-denying candidates, or 19 percent, are running in races that our forecast currently identifies as Solid D, giving them a 5-in-100 or worse shot at winning. This includes candidates such as Jeff Zink, the GOP candidate for Arizona\u2019s 3rd Congressional District. Zink has not only claimed the 2020 election was stolen; he also participated in the Jan. 6 rally that preceded the attack on the U.S. Capitol, though he says he never entered the building. FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Deluxe forecast gives Zink a less than 1-in-100 chance of winning.\u00a0\u00a0 However, very few election deniers are running in toss-up races. Toss-up races are rarer in general \u2014 particularly as partisan redistricting creates fewer competitive districts \u2014 but there are disproportionately fewer election deniers facing these kinds of odds than Republican candidates overall. Just four election-denying candidates (2 percent of all deniers) are running in races that are currently deemed toss-ups by our Deluxe forecast: Kari Lake, who\u2019s running for governor in Arizona; Monica De La Cruz and Mike Garcia, who are running for House seats in Texas and California, respectively; and Senate candidate Adam Laxalt in Nevada. Comparatively, there are 17 Republicans running in toss-up races overall, or 3 percent of candidates. This might be due to Republican voters in competitive districts rejecting more extreme candidates in the primary in favor of a stronger general-election candidate, while voters in solid Democratic or Republican areas could afford to select more extreme candidates since it would have less impact in the general election. Meanwhile, Republican candidates who have accepted the legitimacy of the 2020 election are less likely than election deniers to be in Solid R races. Of the 67 Republican candidates who accept the 2020 election, 30 \u2014 or 45 percent \u2014 are running in races where they have 95-in-100 or better odds. This includes candidates such as North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven, who is running for reelection and is one of the Republicans who voted to certify the 2020 election results.\u00a0 There\u2019s still two weeks left before the election, and the forecast is updating constantly, so none of these results is set in stone. However, this snapshot shows that claiming the 2020 election was stolen doesn\u2019t seem to preclude GOP candidates from winning elections this fall.\u00a0",

    "You're Not Imagining It: There Are Fewer Polls This Cycle": [
        "By Geoffrey Skelley",
        " \u201cThe polls are in crisis. Polling is dead.\u201d We heard variations on this theme after somewhat larger-than-average polling errors in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections. The reality, though, is that polls are still quite important to understanding what the public thinks about different issues and remain useful for forecasting elections, as FiveThirtyEight\u2019s 2022 midterm forecast is doing this year.  In other words, the death of polling has been greatly exaggerated. That doesn\u2019t mean, however, that there aren\u2019t reasons to be worried about the state of polling in 2022. One big concern is that we have fewer surveys of individual contests in 2022 than in previous midterms. And a larger share of that smaller pie has been conducted by partisan pollsters and/or sponsored by partisan organizations, based on an analysis of polls conducted from early May to late October in the 2010, 2014, 2018 and 2022 midterm election cycles.1 As a result, we have less information about individual contests and are more reliant on polls that could be notably biased toward one party. Simply put, there have been way fewer polls in 2022 than in past cycles. In 2010, pollsters conducted almost 1,700 polls of individual races for Senate, House and governor between early May and late October. By comparison, we have slightly more than half that number this time around \u2014 about 900. But this dropoff isn\u2019t sudden; it\u2019s been a more gradual decline over the past decade and a half, as the chart below shows:  Though the overall number of individual races polled has decreased, the number of polls of Senate, House and governors races has varied over these 12 years. This year, we have around 350 polls for both Senate and gubernatorial contests. Compared with 2018, that\u2019s slightly fewer polls of Senate races and slightly more polls of governors races. Still, this is far less than the 500-plus surveys we had of both of those types of races in 2010 and 2014. Meanwhile, the number of House polls has ebbed and flowed since 2010: We only have about 200 House polls over the past six months, almost identical to 2014\u2019s total, whereas we had more than 400 House polls in 2018 and more than 500 in 2010. Interestingly, as the number of surveys of races at the state or district level has fallen, the number of national polls that ask about the generic ballot \u2014 which asks respondents which party they plan to support in their local U.S. House election \u2014 has more than doubled in 2022. This could be down to a couple of factors: For one thing, politics today are more nationalized than in the past, so pollsters may be incentivized to conduct national surveys, which will get more clicks and views. And it\u2019s also potentially more economical \u2014 and safer \u2014 to poll a national audience on different issues and the generic ballot \u2014 which, for instance, can produce multiple stories for a media organization \u2014 than to poll individual races at the state level. The former involves weighting polls by information about the national population, whereas state-level polls may require more difficult choices to properly interpret results, as we\u2019ve consistently seen larger errors in certain states than at the national level. Another factor in the decline of polling of individual contests? A smaller number of pollsters are conducting surveys \u2014 or at least, releasing results. Over the past six months or so, 150 different pollsters have surveyed Senate, House and gubernatorial elections, down from roughly 190 in 2018 and the smallest total for any midterm in our sample. While concerning, this trend isn\u2019t necessarily surprising. Polling has become more expensive and more challenging, as the response rate to more traditional polling methods, like live telephone calls, is sometimes below 1 percent. Moreover, recent polling misses in 2016 and 2020 \u2014 note that 2018 polls were comparatively better \u2014 may have also made major news organizations more hesitant to put themselves out there by releasing surveys of important statewide races. Meanwhile, up-and-comers with more experimental \u2014 and at times, less transparent \u2014 methodologies have increased their polling output.\u00a0\u00a0 As a result, we\u2019re getting more polls from potentially less reliable sources. That\u2019s because, compared with past cycles, polls in 2022 are more likely to be sponsored or associated with partisan sources. This is a problem because partisan polls tend to be more inaccurate than polls conducted by or for nonpartisan groups. Internal polls, which are sponsored by candidates\u2019 campaigns, often try to spin a certain narrative by showing their preferred candidate in a better position than what polls from nonpartisan sources are indicating.\u00a0 On FiveThirtyEight\u2019s polls page, we denote whether a poll is sponsored by an organization that is considered partisan or is sponsored by a campaign.2 When we looked at the share of partisan polls in 2022 and for previous midterms, we found that the percentage of polls in Senate, House and gubernatorial contests coming from partisan sources has reached new heights.  Now, it\u2019s not unusual to have a high percentage of partisan polls when looking solely at individual House races. House districts usually have smaller populations than states, so they tend to be harder to poll, which means campaigns often do much of the survey work in them. From 2010 to 2018, nearly half of all House polls came from campaigns or partisan groups. Yet that share has climbed to 54 percent this cycle amid a smaller number of overall House polls. Perhaps more disconcertingly, the share of Senate and gubernatorial surveys from partisan sources has risen to about one-third and one-quarter, respectively, even as the overall number of each is similar to 2018. Conversely, we\u2019re seeing a smaller number of horse-race polls conducted by or sponsored by \u201clegacy media\u201d outlets, which we broadly define as longstanding news sources with a major national reach.3 For instance, in 2010, legacy media sponsored and/or conducted 85 Senate polls and 64 governors polls between May and late October. But in the same span this year, the corresponding figures are just 25 Senate polls and 33 governors surveys. This situation is perhaps best-illustrated by the rise of The Trafalgar Group, a Republican pollster that reaches respondents in different ways by using a mixed-mode approach. This cycle, Trafalgar is tied for the most Senate polls conducted (23) and ranks second in gubernatorial surveys (25),4 after releasing only a handful of polls in the same period in 2018 (the pollster became more prominent in 2020). In both cases, Trafalgar is either tied with or just trails Emerson College, another mixed-mode pollster that has become prodigious over the past couple of election cycles \u2014 although Emerson is nonpartisan. With fewer total surveys, fewer races have been polled \u2014 especially in the House. So far this cycle, we have polls from 96 districts, which represents only about one-fifth of the chamber and is far less polling than the almost 150 districts surveyed in 2018 and nearly 170 in 2010. However, that 96-district figure is a bit deceiving, because only about half of those districts have more than one poll, including races where the same pollster has released more than one. This is problematic not just for the 339 districts for which we have zero polls, but also for our forecast, which takes polling data from districts that have it and infers numbers for similar-looking districts that lack polls. One silver lining, though, is that we have a decent amount of polling in competitive Senate and gubernatorial races. This year, we have an average of about 26 surveys in the eight Senate races rated somewhere from \u201clean Republican,\u201d to \u201clean Democratic\u201d by election handicappers at The Cook Political Report, Inside Elections and Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball, and an average of about 16 surveys in the eight highly competitive gubernatorial contests. That Senate figure is right in between the average number of polls in 2010 and 2014 (about 24 and 29, respectively), helped out in part by the fact that fewer Senate seats are in play this year. The gubernatorial figure is lower than 2010 or 2014 figures but is actually much better than 2018\u2019s.  Still, we have less polling in seemingly uncompetitive statewide races than in most recent midterm cycles, which could make it more likely that we miss a late-developing and potentially surprising result. The state of polling is disconcerting. We have fewer polls, and a larger share of them come from partisan sources. We also have less information about House races, making race-to-race forecasting more perilous. All of this is a challenge for what we do at FiveThirtyEight, and we hope that pollsters and news organizations figure out how to offer the public greater polling information in the future.

    "The Polls Are Getting Better For Republicans": [
        "By Nathaniel Rakich",
        " For months, Democrats were defying midterm gravity. Now, it looks like they may be coming back down to earth. The president\u2019s party almost always does poorly in midterm elections, and early in the year, it looked like that trend would hold true in 2022. But after the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion in its Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization case, Democrats experienced a boost in the polls.  The generic congressional ballot is a poll question that asks people nationwide which party they plan to vote for for Congress (without naming specific candidates). And as recently as Oct. 13, Democrats led by 1.1 percentage points in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s generic congressional ballot polling average. Now, however, Republicans lead in this polling average by 0.5 points,1 suggesting the national mood has turned back toward the GOP.  Individual polls mostly confirm this movement. I compared generic-ballot polls with a FiveThirtyEight pollster rating of B+ or higher from October to the same polls conducted in September. On average, they showed a 1.2-point shift toward Republicans. This included shifts of 4 points from two of the best pollsters in the business, Monmouth University and Siena College/The New York Times Upshot. This change has affected FiveThirtyEight\u2019s midterm forecasts too. Democrats\u2019 chances of holding onto Senate control have fallen from 66-in-100 on Oct. 13 to 55-in-100 today. And Republicans have gone from having a 69-in-100 chance of flipping the House on Oct. 13 to an 80-in-100 chance today. Republicans\u2019 chances in the House have risen that high because the forecast expects the final margin to be even better for Republicans than the generic-ballot polls currently suggest. The forecast projects that, on average, Republicans will win the national popular vote for the House by 4.0 points. How does the forecast get from 0.5 points to 4.0 points? For one thing, Democrats aren\u2019t fielding a candidate in 23 House districts this year, so they won\u2019t get any votes there. In comparison, there are only 14 districts where Republicans aren\u2019t fielding a candidate. However, all the uncontested districts were already safe for the other party, so this shouldn\u2019t affect the seat breakdown. In addition, our average of generic-ballot polls includes polls of adults, registered voters and likely voters. But if you\u2019re interested in who will win an election, you\u2019re most interested in the polls of likely voters. And likely voter polls tend to be better for Republicans than the other two types. For example, if we were to calculate a generic-ballot polling average using only likely voter polls, Republicans would lead by 1.1 points, not 0.5. And here are the four most recent generic-ballot polls that have released numbers among both registered voters and likely voters: Finally, generic-ballot polling historically tends to get worse for the president\u2019s party as the election approaches. The graph below shows how the FiveThirtyEight generic-ballot polling average2 shifted in the last 90 days of the 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018 midterms. As you can see, the president\u2019s party lost ground in the final month of every year but 2018.  Of course, we\u2019re only two weeks away from Election Day, and millions of Americans have already voted early or absentee, but there is still time for polls to get better for Republicans. On average, in 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018, the generic-ballot margin got 1.2 points worse for the president\u2019s party in the final 15 days. But that doesn\u2019t mean the Dobbs decision didn\u2019t make a difference. Take another look at that graph. The 2022 line (along with the 2014 line) is at the very top of the chart. In other words, Democrats may lose ground from here on out, but they are starting from a higher baseline than usual. And without the boost Democrats received over the summer, we may have been forecasting a so-called \u201cred wave\u201d \u2014 a Republican landslide of 6-10 points. While the possibility of another polling error in Republicans\u2019 favor means that outcome is still on the table, it\u2019s more likely that 2022 will be a more modest Republican victory. For Democrats, it could have been a lot worse. Aaron Bycoffe contributed research.",

    "Is College Worth It? Voters Are Split.": [
        "By Monica Potts",
        " Welcome to Invisible Divides, a series exploring the profound differences in worldview between Democrats and Republicans. These beliefs about education, religion, gender, race and political extremism align with partisanship \u2014 but run much deeper. Differences like these don\u2019t just influence the ways Democrats and Republicans vote, but also how they think about their place in America. And they help explain why opposing views on important issues today seem increasingly irreconcilable. When Dale Nicholls started college in 1984, he soon realized books weren\u2019t for him. So he entered the workforce, started a job as a truck driver and eventually worked his way up to owning and running his own trucking company. His professional experience, he said, taught him more than what he\u2019d have been able to learn in school.  \u201cA lot of the degrees people are getting, there\u2019s no use for them in the real world, and so you\u2019re finding a lot of people come out of college and then can\u2019t get a job because their degrees are no good,\u201d he said in an interview with FiveThirtyEight. Nicholls, now 60, doesn\u2019t believe that everyone should go to college no matter how much it costs and no matter how much debt students take on. This belief puts him on one side of a deep and growing divide in the American electorate regarding attitudes about higher education and its value.  FiveThirtyEight has partnered with PerryUndem and YouGov to survey likely voters on how deep these types of fissures run.1 In this first installment of our series exploring the invisible divides in America \u2014 the differences in worldview that shape how people vote and think about their place in America \u2014 we look at the education divide. For the past two decades, a voter\u2019s level of education has become an increasingly important predictor in how he or she votes. But we found that the divide is about more than just the level of education someone has: Americans have diverging attitudes about the role higher education itself plays in American society. Like other divides we\u2019ll be exploring, they help explain why Republicans and Democrats seem unable to find common ground on so many issues. Since the late 1990s, college-educated voters have been moving towards the Democratic Party while voters without a college degree have become more decidedly Republican-leaning. By the time former President Barack Obama left office, those lines had solidified: A majority of college-educated voters identified as Democrats, while a majority of voters without a college degree identified as Republicans. In the 2016 election, education was a better predictor of who voted for former President Donald Trump than income.  As this divide deepened, views on higher education became even more partisan. That has influenced how politicians talk about higher education, as well as their policy approaches to it. During his administration, Trump not only launched attacks on colleges, especially those he deemed elite \u2014 despite himself having graduated from the University of Pennsylvania \u2014 but began accusing them of spreading liberal propaganda. \u201cToo many Universities and School Systems are about Radical Left Indoctrination, not Education,\u201d he wrote on Twitter in 2020.  In the FiveThirtyEight/PerryUndem/YouGov survey \u2014 which Nicholls participated in \u2014 51 percent of respondents agreed with the idea that \u201ca college education is the best way to get ahead in the U.S.\u201d But agreement differed significantly by respondent\u2019s partisan affiliations: Seventy-one percent of self-identified Democrats agreed while 37 percent of self-identified Republicans did.  Respondents were also asked a series of questions to gauge how they felt about higher education. Fifty-seven percent of respondents disagreed with the statement \u201ccollege makes you lose common sense,\u201d while 37 percent agreed. Of those who agreed, 65 percent planned to \u201cdefinitely\u201d vote for the Republican candidate in the upcoming midterms, while 12 percent of those who agreed planned to \u201cdefinitely\u201d vote for the Democratic candidate.2\u00a0 More than 4 in 5 Republicans agreed with the statements that \u201cmost college professors teach liberal propaganda\u201d and \u201chigh schools are trying to teach liberal propaganda,\u201d compared with 17 and 16 percent of Democrats, respectively. Those who agreed with one of these statements generally also agreed with the other (90 percent). There weren\u2019t huge differences in how people answered these questions based on level of education (except for people with postgraduate degrees). Instead, it was partisanship that mattered.  Voters\u2019 views on college often aligned with how they\u2019d respond to other, seemingly unrelated questions. Those who agreed with statements like \u201ccollege makes you lose common sense,\u201d were less likely to think climate change (35 percent) and racism or racial inequality (40 percent) were problems than those who disagreed (both 85 percent),3 and less likely to think that high school students should learn about sexism and gender inequality (32 percent) and systemic racism (28 percent).4 They were also more likely to think inflation and the national economy would be worse a year from now, independent of their household income levels, according to analysis by Duncan Gans, a senior research analyst with PerryUndem.  This hints that the division is about more than simply getting a college education or having a higher income. \u201cCollege\u201d and, relatedly, \u201celitism\u201d are concepts that seem to be linked to otherwise unrelated ideas \u2014 like support for LGBTQ+ rights or racial justice \u2014 which have, in turn, become associated with the identity of the Democratic Party. Increasingly, it seems that when politicians like Trump rail against the elite \u2014 a word that might otherwise mean a level of wealth and power he, himself, has \u2014 it\u2019s meant as a cultural designation, not a socioeconomic one.\u00a0 Sharon Martin, who is 71 and lives in Virginia, participated in an online focus group as part of our poll. \u201cI believe the young people go into college to get an education but instead are taught how to think as a group,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThey are taught, or should I say instructed, by professors that I believe are pushing their ideals and desires.\u201d Jim Burke, a 61-year-old from Pennsylvania who spoke with FiveThirtyEight after taking part in the survey, agreed. He\u2019s a pharmacist who went to a Catholic college and became conservative after having children. \u201cMy daughter went to college as a staunch Republican and she came out a liberal Democrat,\u201d he said. \u201cTotally due to her education.\u201d (In 2020, voters under 30 were the most Democratic-leaning age group, although this age group is less likely to vote than older groups.) It\u2019s easy enough to see how this divide manifests in American society, as concern over what is taught in colleges has also trickled down to lower levels of education. Over the past two years, PEN America has been tracking laws that aim to prevent public college professors and primary and secondary education teachers from teaching \u201cdivisive\u201d concepts, which may include racism, sexism or gender identity. Fourteen states have passed such laws, but bills have been introduced across the country. States have also passed laws restricting LGBTQ+ students\u2019 access to school sports and health care and banned school libraries from carrying books on subjects deemed controversial. This fall, a Pennsylvania school district pulled the \u201cGirls Who Code\u201d book series, meant to encourage girls of color to enter careers in tech. Across the country, many Republican candidates have made battles over what\u2019s taught in schools central to their campaigns. President Biden\u2019s student loan forgiveness plan has illuminated the depths of this anti-elitism divide. In September, about a month after Biden announced his plan to cancel up to $20,000 in student loan debt for certain borrowers, 22 Republican governors sent him a letter asking him to withdraw the plan. They argued it \u201crewards the rich and punishes the poor\u201d by taxing hourly workers who hadn\u2019t gone to college just to benefit higher earners who had. (Of course, not everyone who owes student loans is a higher earner \u2014 the U.S. Department of Education estimates that 87 percent of the debt cancellation benefits will go to those who earn less than $75,000 annually.) It\u2019s not surprising that polls show voters divided on student loan forgiveness by party. In a Daily Kos/Civiqs Poll from August, right after Biden\u2019s plan was announced, 88 percent of Republicans and 56 percent of independent voters disapproved, while 88 percent of Democrats approved. A Quinnipiac University poll, also from the end of August, found that 81 percent of Republicans disapproved while 88 percent of Democrats approved.  But Rachel Fishman, the acting director with the Education Policy program at New America, said there are partisan divides on whether the government should be funding colleges and universities at all. New America\u2019s annual report measuring attitudes about higher education found this year that 77 percent of Democrats thought the government should be more responsible for funding higher education, while 63 percent of Republicans said students should be more responsible.\u00a0 \u201cYou can kind of piece together from there how the subsequent answers on questions about funding and value kind of fall into place from that notion,\u201d Fishman said.\u00a0 In the New America survey, Republicans viewed attending college as something students themselves benefit from, but did not necessarily see colleges as something that benefited communities or the country as a whole. This could have implications for many battles to come, as Democrats want to increase federal funding for higher education and make at least some colleges free, while Republicans are more focused on scaling back student loan forgiveness and on curriculum battles. It could also matter for bigger questions, like whether high school graduates should have equal access to higher education regardless of their ability to pay; whether and how to fund alternatives to colleges and universities; how to best prepare students for higher education; and whether research led by academic institutions is trusted.\u00a0 Indeed, it\u2019s becoming clearer that some voters think higher education institutions are actually bad for the country. \u201cAs much good as I think they do, I think they do as much harm,\u201d Burke said. \u201cThe one thing that they do do well is they \u2026 make the kids think. Unfortunately, that thinking is guided to a specific point, and not just open ended.\u201d Holly Fuong and Duncan Gans contributed research. ",

    "Will Republican Gains In South Texas Win Them More House Seats?": [
        "By Alex Samuels",
        " It was a question that befuddled election prognosticators and the media in the Lone Star State: How did then-President Donald Trump gain traction in or outright flip a sizable chunk of the 28 counties1 along the Texas-Mexico border in 2020? Indeed, two years ago, voters living along Texas\u2019s border shifted rather substantially toward Trump: He won 14 of Texas\u2019s 28 border or South Texas counties \u2014 eight of which he flipped from 2016. And while President Biden still carried the region by 17 percentage points, this was about half the margin Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Although Democrats are bullish on bringing these voters back into the fold \u2014 or at least preserving their much-reduced advantage \u2014 that could prove challenging given that signs look promising for Republicans this year. In June, Republican Mayra Flores defeated Democrat Dan Sanchez in a special election in the state\u2019s 34th District. Additionally, state Republicans have increased their outreach and recruitment efforts in South Texas, and Republicans are largely trusted more on many policy issues \u2014 like immigration and the economy \u2014 that are top of mind for Latino voters, according to some polls. But while this year\u2019s elections will offer clues about the durability of Republicans\u2019 gains, the results won\u2019t provide a definitive answer because the electoral environment this year generally favors Republicans. In turn, this might mean narrower margins for Democrats, versus outright losses for the them. The table below shows the three Texas districts in which our Deluxe forecast doesn\u2019t see a clear favorite, and only one is a toss-up.  To be clear, even though redistricting improved Democrats\u2019 chances in two of the districts highlighted above, they\u2019re still on the defensive this year.2 And they have good reason to be: Over the summer, Republicans have outraised their rivals in all three districts, and the Cook Political Report recently moved their election ratings for the 15th and 34th Districts toward the GOP. And as the chart above shows, even our forecast indicates that there\u2019s a decent chance that Republicans will hold or flip one or more of these seats in the next Congress. So how did this region become more competitive, and what does Republicans\u2019 electoral future there look like? Let\u2019s dive in.  According to our forecast, Republicans\u2019 best chance of gaining a congressional seat in South Texas is the now-open 15th District \u2014 which Trump won by 3 points in 2020 \u2014\u00a0where Democrat Michelle Vallejo and Republican Monica De La Cruz are neck-and-neck.3 For Republicans, this race is reminiscent of 2020, when De La Cruz came within less than 3 points of unseating Rep. Vicente Gonzalez. This go-around, however, De La Cruz has more leverage. On top of the district getting redrawn to be more Republican-leaning, she has a massive financial edge as of late September, and Vallejo reportedly isn\u2019t getting much support from the national party. (This stands in stark contrast to national Republicans, who have flooded the airwaves with TV ads attacking Vallejo for being too progressive.) \u201cBecause of redistricting, this district was morphed into one that is definitely more conservative, so there is the sense among national Democrats that the 15th is doomed,\u201d said Andrew Smith, a political science professor at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. \u201cAs a result, the sentiment from the national party has been to put money toward other House races where they think Democrats have more of a chance.\u201d But this race is no slam dunk for De La Cruz. Throughout the year, the Republican attracted a number of negative headlines. And recently, Vallejo released a TV ad calling De La Cruz \u201ctoo extreme\u201d on abortion. That could hurt her in a district with a voting-age population that is 79 percent Hispanic, according to FiveThirtyEight data, since abortion continues to be an issue Hispanic voters largely support. Of course, the mudslinging has gone both ways, and Republicans\u2019 attacks could land too. National GOP groups are trying to paint Vallejo as a radical. In fact, one spot accused the Democrat of \u201chosting a border resistance event at her family business,\u201d complete with \u201canarchist artwork\u201d and calls to \u201csmash ICE,\u201d or the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. Beyond the political smears, politics and PAC money, this race will likely come down to which issues voters prioritize. Competitive districts often compel candidates to run toward the middle, but neither seems to be doing that. Vallejo was recruited to run for the seat by a local progressive organization and has campaigned on a platform that included support for policies like \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and a $15 minimum wage. Monica De La Cruz, meanwhile, hasn\u2019t been shy about her anti-abortion views. She also has Trump\u2019s support and has denied, without evidence, the outcome of the 2020 election. \u201cThis race will definitely come down to the issues. Abortion, while not the main issue, is nonetheless motivating younger and more progressive Hispanics to turn up at the polls \u2014 which might help Vallejo. On the flip side, De La Cruz will certainly be able to pick up a lot of votes among the more religious and evangelical Christian voters because of her unapologetic anti-abortion stance,\u201d Smith said. \u201cSo the question is, which of their candidacies is capturing the pulse more of what the majority voting population down here wants?\u201d Both the 28th and 34th Districts in Texas lean more toward Democrats, so the focus here is mainly about how narrow of a race can Republicans make it, if they don\u2019t win outright. In the race for the 34th, Gonzalez has about a 2-in-3 chance of besting Flores,4 who is running for reelection following her victory in the special election this past June. Gonzalez currently represents the 15th District, but decided to run in the 34th after his old district was made more competitive in redistricting. What\u2019s working in the Democrat\u2019s favor is that the 34th District is now much safer for Democrats than it was during Flores\u2019s special election. That election was conducted under the old district lines, which had a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean of D+55 \u2014 meaning it was 5 points more Democratic than the country as a whole \u2014 but the new district has a partisan lean of D+17. And while we have very little polling in this race, an RMG Research/U.S. Term Limits survey conducted July 23-Aug. 1 gave Gonzalez a 4-point edge among likely voters. Also, during the special election, Flores\u2019s Democratic rival was significantly underfunded and got little help from the national party; Gonzalez, though, has a small advantage over Flores when it comes to cash on hand, and he is receiving help from Democrats\u2019 national campaign spending arm. But this district could also be in play, according to Smith and other forecasters who have assessed the race as a toss-up. Republican groups are getting involved in the race, and a super PAC affiliated with House Republican leadership has worked to paint Gonzalez as out-of-touch with voters. Plus, Gonzalez comes with some baggage, including an incident in July after his campaign paid for advertising on a political blog that used racist language to describe Flores.  Of the three competitive districts this fall, arguably the easiest race for Democrats will be in the 28th District, where longtime Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar has roughly an 8-in-10 chance of beating Republican Cassy Garcia.6 There are many likely explanations for this. First, he\u2019s raised much more money overall than his rival. Also, the 28th District became slightly bluer in redistricting, going from a partisan lean of D+4 to D+7. But what could be helping Cuellar the most is that he\u2019s no longer in the headlines for an FBI raid on his home and campaign office in January \u2014 at least compared with how he was around the time of his competitive primary \u2014 and subsequent runoff election \u2014 this spring. (Cuellar\u2019s attorney has said he is not the target of the investigation.) Indeed, Cuellar will be a tough Democrat to beat, as evidenced by his roughly 18 years in Congress. His anti-abortion, pro-gun rights views and his tough-on-the-border posture fits well with his culturally conservative seat, as made clear by how he sailed to reelection in 2020, outperforming Biden by 15 points. And his moderate views could also make it harder for Republicans to call him radical. Still, Republicans have a somewhat competitive challenger in Garcia, a former staffer of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. In addition to a number of national groups rushing to her defense, Garcia has raised more than $1 million in the third quarter of this year and has outraised Cuellar\u2019s past GOP opponents, according to the Cook Political Report.  Altogether, these three races will likely be the biggest test of Texas Republicans\u2019 durability on the Texas border. But it won\u2019t answer all the questions about how much support they\u2019ve siphoned away from Democrats: For one thing, the electoral environment favors Republicans this year. On top of that, similar economic concerns that benefitted Trump in 2020 still seem to be in play. And immigration is arguably more salient now for South Texans more so than it was two years ago as the number of migrant encounters at the state\u2019s southern border has increased.  The districts are important symbolically as well, and both parties will be watching closely to see what happens. \u201cIf Republicans win or come extremely close to winning in any of these districts, I think the party will take it as a sign that their strategy \u2014 pouring in money, animating immigration-related issues and so forth \u2014 is starting to bear fruit,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIn any case, though, I think this region is far more competitive than in the past, and I do think you\u2019re going to see more Republican efforts to make the Lower Rio Grande Valley, if not red, then at least purple going forward.\u201d",

    "Why I'm Telling My Friends That The Senate Is A Toss-Up": [
        "By Nate Silver",
        " The Senate started out as a toss-up when we launched our forecast in June \u2014 and after a summer in which political developments mostly played to Democrats\u2019 favor, there is now clear movement back toward Republicans. The FiveThirtyEight Senate forecast gives Democrats a 58 percent chance of keeping control of the Senate, down from a peak of 71 percent last month.1 How to translate a roughly 60 percent chance into words is a tricky one, since it\u2019s right on the threshold where you might choose to emphasize that one party is ahead or that it\u2019s pretty close to 50-50. Poker players use the term \u201cflip\u201d (short for \u201ccoin flip\u201d) when two hands have about an equal chance of winning, even if the chances aren\u2019t exactly equal. Most players would describe this poker hand as a \u201cflip,\u201d for instance, even though the pair of 10s would win 57 percent of the time. In politics, the similar term \u201ctoss-up\u201d is often applied, although the definition is fuzzy. We\u2019re even inconsistent in how we use it ourselves.2 But let\u2019s get real. If a friend asked me to characterize the Senate race, I\u2019d say \u201cit\u2019s pretty fucking close,\u201d and emphasize that neither party has much of an advantage. Here\u2019s why. For one thing, as of Thursday afternoon, Republicans realized a slight lead (of 0.1 percentage points) in the FiveThirtyEight generic ballot average for the first time since Aug. 2.  Obviously, a lead of a tenth of a percentage point isn\u2019t much. The advantage may have flipped back by the time that you\u2019re reading this. But the tied generic ballot overstates the case for Democrats. That\u2019s because our polling average takes generic ballot polls as they come, which are a combination of polls of likely voters, registered voters and all adults. Our model, however, takes an additional step and adjusts polls of registered voters and adults to make them more similar to polls of likely voters, which this year have been more favorable to Republicans. So a tie on the generic ballot among all polls translates to a slight GOP lead with the likely voter adjustment.  Something else that\u2019s made this year\u2019s forecast hard to convey in plain English is that there are three entirely plausible scenarios: A Republican sweep of Congress, a Democratic sweep or a split Congress (which would more likely involve a Democratic Senate and a GOP House, rather than the other way around). Until recently, a split Congress had the most likely of the three scenarios, though the chances of this outcome were under 50 percent. Now, however, a GOP sweep (41 percent) is more likely than a split (38 percent): And all of that is before getting into the chance that the polls could overstate support for Democrats again, as they did in 2016 and 2020. This is a complicated subject; I mostly think the model does a good job of accounting for this, and one should keep in mind there\u2019s also the possibility that the polls could be biased against Democrats. But I\u2019m not entirely confident, so my mental model is slightly more favorable to the GOP than the FiveThirtyEight forecast itself. It\u2019s worth noting, though, that some of the states where people had been most concerned about the polls being wrong, such as Wisconsin and Ohio, have shown a shift toward the GOP in recent weeks. But the main reason why I think of the race for control of the Senate as a toss-up \u2014 rather than slightly favoring Democrats \u2014 is because there\u2019s been steady movement toward the GOP in our model over the past few weeks. In principle, past movement shouldn\u2019t predict future movement in our forecast and it should instead resemble a random walk. (We put a lot of effort in our modeling into trying to minimize autocorrelation.) This year, though, the forecast has moved in a predictable-seeming way, with a long, slow and steady climb toward Democrats over the summer, and now a consistent shift back toward Republicans. What\u2019s produced this pattern? It\u2019s hard to know whether it reflects the real state of the race or is an artifact of how our model works. The summer produced an unusual streak of favorable developments for Democrats, from the backlash to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn the constitutional right to abortion, to lower gas prices, to former President Donald Trump\u2019s unhelpful involvement in the midterms, to a string of legislative victories for President Biden. There is, of course, a tendency to see patterns in random noise, but it\u2019s as though the coin really did come up heads for Democrats six or seven times in a row. From a modeling standpoint, another challenge is that Democrats were defying political gravity. The president\u2019s party typically performs poorly in the midterms. There have been some exceptions and there is some reason to think this year may be one of them. But the model has been trying to balance polls showing Democrats having a pretty good year against its prior expectation that the electoral environment should be poor for Democrats. As the election nears, the model relies on its priors less and trusts the polls more, so it was initially skeptical of buying into a post-Dobbs surge for Democrats. Right about the time the model had fully priced in Democrats\u2019 improved polling, though, the news cycle shifted toward a set of stories that were more favorable for Republicans, such as immigration and renewed concerns about inflation. It\u2019s also possible to overstate the case for Republican momentum. Midterm elections tend not to turn on a dime in the way that presidential elections sometimes do. And there haven\u2019t been any self-evidently important developments in the news cycle in the past week or so. If you\u2019re one of those people who thinks gas prices are all-determining of election outcomes, they\u2019ve even started to come down again slightly. Rather, this is more a case of now having more evidence to confirm that the Democrats\u2019 summer polling surge wasn\u2019t sustainable. That doesn\u2019t mean it was fake: In fact, Democrats had a string of excellent special election and ballot referendum results in which they met or exceeded their polling. If you\u2019d held the midterms in late August, I\u2019d have bet heavily on Democrats to win the Senate. It sure would be nice to have another special election or two now, and to see how these polling shifts translate into real results. Polls can sometimes change for reasons that don\u2019t reflect the underlying reality of the race, such as because of partisan nonresponse bias or pollster herding. And certainly, Democrats have plenty of paths to retain the Senate. Republicans don\u2019t have any sure-fire pickups; Nevada is the most likely, and even there, GOP chances are only 53 percent, according to our forecast. Meanwhile, Democrat John Fetterman is still ahead in polls of Pennsylvania, although his margin over Republican Mehmet Oz has narrowed. The model is likely to be quite sensitive to new polling in Pennsylvania going forward. If Democrats gain a seat there, meaning that the GOP would need to flip two Democratic-held seats to take the chamber, that starts to become a tall order. Nevada, sure, but I\u2019m not sure Republicans would want to count on Herschel Walker in Georgia or Blake Masters in Arizona. But the bottom line is this: If you\u2019d asked me a month ago \u2014 or really even a week ago \u2014 which party\u2019s position I\u2019d rather be in, I would have said the Democrats. Now, I honestly don\u2019t know.",

    "Muslim-Americans find common ground with conservatives over politicization of America's schools": [
        " \n        By\n        Haris Alic   | Fox News ",
        " An alliance is forming in some communities across the country between Muslim American parents andconservative groupsover what they see as leftist, wokepoliticization of America's schools. Muslim Americans have increasingly begun showing up at school boards from Minnesota to Virginia to excoriate education officials for embracing woke priorities, including critical race theory, and allowing explicit materials in the classroom. \"We\u2019re hearing from folks in the community that they\u2019re tired of the politicization of the schools their children attend,\" said Preya Samsundar, the Republican National Committee's Midwest communications director. \"It\u2019s not just explicit materials in schools, but they're concerned about [COVID-19] lockdowns, distance learning, the quality of education, woke politics in classrooms, and the achievement.\" For many the fight is personal. Muslim Americans, especially recent immigrants, have long viewed U.S. schools as the key to upward mobility and success. That viewpoint has changed for some in recent years, however. US MATH, READING TEST SCORES PLUNGE FOR STUDENTS ACROSS COUNTRY FOLLOWING COVID-19 PANDEMIC Shukri Abdirahman, a Somali-American who ran for Congress this year as a Republican in Minnesota, said the coronavirus pandemic exposed critical flaws within the education system. \"With our children and doing in-person learning, we saw the curriculums and how teachers were responding,\" said Abdirahman. \"Slowly it became apparent that our children were learning more about gender identity and critical race theory, than they were about math and reading.\" CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BROADCASTS SEXUALLY EXPLICIT BOOKS, SOME COVERING 'PEDOPHILES,' KINK AND PORNOGRAPHIC IMAGES Abdirahman said she was stirred to action when her six-year-old son was scolded in school for saying \"oh God\" after falling down in school. Since then, she's worked to mobilize the Somali American community in support of the Minnesota Parents Alliance. The group is working to educate and empower parents to push back on progressive policies being adopted by school districts across the state. So far, the effort has paid off. At a recent school board meeting in Wilmer, Minnesota, nearly a dozen Somali American parents showed up to protest reports of LGBTQ pride flags being flown at K-12 educational institutions. Although the local school district denied such flags were being flown, the presence of so many Somali American parents alongside conservative activists showcased a new coalition. \"Muslim Americans want the same thing as any parent in this country,\" said Abdirahman. \"The right for their children to get a quality education without being indoctrinated. This shouldn't be political, but it seems only like conservatives and Republicans agree.\" The alliance between conservative education activists and Muslim Americans has also been on display in Virginia, Missouri, and Michigan. Muslim and South Asian Americans have increasingly shown up at school board meetings throughout Virginia to oppose critical race theory and policies allowing transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms of the sex they identify as. The latter issue was highlighted last year when a female student was raped by a male student allegedly wearing a skirt at a school in suburban Loudon County. In Missouri, meanwhile, Bosnian American Muslims have been vocal in opposing the inclusion of sexually explicit material in school libraries. The same issue recently catapulted to national attention at a school board meeting in Dearborn, Michigan. Muslim Americans, from Dearborn's large Middle Eastern population, turned out in high numbers to protest the school district's decision to includeLGBTQ books in school libraries. The parents claimed that many of the books were sexually explicit and inappropriate for young children. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"We're not worried about [LGBT] people,\" said a Dearborn parent, who attended the school board meeting. \"We're worried about our children. If they wind up gay at 18, who cares? But the school library shouldn't be letting 10-year-olds read books that detail sexual acts.\" The appeal of conservative parents' rights message to some members of the Muslim American community has Republicans hopeful of expanding their party. GOP elected officials in Virginia, Michigan, and Minnesota are working to make inroads with Muslim voters using the issue. \"I am proud to stand with the parents of Dearborn,\" said Matthew DePerno, the Republican nominee for Michigan attorney general.\" \"We must fight against the sexualization of our schools.\"",

        " Republican Florida Gov.Ron DeSantisvowed Monday to end the political career of his Democratic opponent Charlie Crist while the latter defended gender surgeries for minors during a fiery debate just two weeks ahead of the November general election. \"Well listen, I know that Charlie is interested in talking about 2024 and Joe Biden, but I just want to make things very, very clear: The only worn out, old donkey I'm looking to put out to pasture is Charlie Crist,\" DeSantis declared after Crist tried to force him to say whether he was planning to run for president or serve another full term as governor should he be re-elected. The moment came as the two clashed over the economy and plans to tackle the historic inflation gripping the nation, brought on, DeSantis said, by the policies ofPresident Joe Bidenand Democrats like Crist. DeSantis, who is widely seen asa potential challengerto Biden in 2024, didn't say whether he would serve a full second term as governor, but instead hit back at Crist with criticism over his tax policies when he served as governor from 2007 to 2011.

You think you know better than any physician, any doctor, or any woman in a position to make decisions about their own personal health. You want to be the judge. You want to decide about what people should do with their own physical being, with the betterment of their health, with whether or not they want to make sure that they can practice their right to choose as a woman. That's just not right. I don't believe in that,\" he said. \"You don't have the temperament to be kind and decent to other people who don't look like you, who don't act like you, and don't contribute to you. We're all children of God, and that doesn't mean that you're the one who's supposed to judge about what other people are supposed to do, particularly women, with their body,\" he added. DeSantis pushed back, arguing young teens weren't in a position to know enough to make such a decision, and referenced another law preventing teens from doing certain things to their bodies. \"If you're a 15-year-old, you can't go get a tattoo in the state of Florida, yet we're saying you could get a double mastectomy?

        " Two weeks before the November midterms,the Justice Departmentis fighting a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request on how it is enforcing President Biden\u2019s executive order that directed federal agencies to engage in what a government watchdog group calls an \"unconstitutional taxpayer-funded \u2018get out the vote\u2019 effort designed to benefit the president\u2019s political party.\" Biden's order from March 2021, \"Promoting Access to Voting,\" states that \"executive departments and agencies (agencies) should partner with State, local, Tribal, and territorial election officials to protect and promote the exercise of the right to vote, eliminate discrimination and other barriers to voting, and expand access to voter registration and accurate election information.\" After unsuccessfully seeking information about DOJ's plan to implement that order, the Foundation for Government Accountability (FGA) sued DOJ for that information in April 2022. Six months later and with the midterm elections approaching fast, all FGA has is a handful of heavily redacted documents. US ANNOUNCES MULTIPLE CASES AGAINST CHINESE INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS: 'FLAGRANT VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAWS' The group accuses theBiden administrationof hiding its effort to have the federal government work to the benefit of Democrats. \"President Biden is deeply unpopular.

But the 135 pages DOJ produced were largely redacted, and FGA said it didn't come close to satisfying their demand. \"Among the missing documents was the DOJ\u2019s 15-page strategic plan that detailed how the agency will help increase voter registration and participation,\" FGA said. \"This document is a finished product, completed as part of Biden\u2019s executive order.

DOJ argued that the FOIA documents they withheld or redacted are protected by the presidential-communications privilege or the deliberative-process privilege. In its Oct. 21 legal filing, DOJ insisted the release of this information would cause \"public confusion\" because its implementation plan \"contains many proposed actions that the public might construe as \u2018future commitments, past actions, or provisions already in place.'\" Stewart Whitson, legal director for FGA, told Fox News Digital his group is \"preparing a cross motion to counter DOJ\u2019s stonewalling. \"We\u2019ll ask the judge to compel DOJ to finally reveal documents they\u2019ve been hiding, including their strategic plan to carry out President Biden\u2019s federal election scheme,\" he said.

        " \n        By\n        Caitlin McFall ,  Kelly Phares   | Fox News ",
        " Chair of the Congressional Progressive CaucusRep. Pramila Jayapalon Tuesday withdrew a letter sent to President Biden this week urging him to secure a peace deal in Ukraine. Jayapal said the letter in question was drafted months ago and was not properly vetted before its distribution by a staff member Monday. The chairwoman said that while she accepts responsibility for the letter\u2019s distribution, she wanted to make clear it does not mean Democrats support pulling theplug on aid to Ukraine. FAR-LEFT DEMS URGE BIDEN TO PUSH PEACE DEAL IN UKRAINE, THROW PARTY INTO UPROAR \"Because of the timing, our message is being conflated by some as being equivalent to the recent statement by Republican Leader McCarthy threatening an end to aid to Ukraine if Republicans take over,\" she said. \"Nothing could be further from the truth.\" The letter in question caused uproar Monday after she and 29 other progressive members of the Party like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D- N.Y., called on Biden to take immediate steps to negotiation with Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"We agree with the Administration\u2019s perspective that it is not America\u2019s place to pressure Ukraine\u2019s government regarding sovereign decisions, and with the principle you have enunciated that there should be \u2018nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine,'\" the group wrote. \"But as legislators responsible for the expenditure of tens of billions of U.S.taxpayer dollars in military assistancein the conflict, we believe such involvement in this war also creates a responsibility for the United States to seriously explore all possible avenues, including direct engagement with Russia, to reduce harm and support Ukraine in achieving a peaceful settlement,\" they added.

        " A user on Reddit posted this open-ended question this weekend on the popular subreddit known as \"Ask Reddit\": \"Americans, what is a good thing about your country?\" Some of the answers reflectedstrong and abiding patriotism\u2014 and elicited thousands of other responses and pieces of conversation \u2014 while other answers were thought-provoking. Here's a look at some top responses. \u2018ANNOYING\u2019 PEOPLE SAY THESE 75 THINGS, ACCORDING TO REDDIT USERS (And please weigh in with your own thoughts in the comments section below.) \"I am a naturalized U.S. citizen, have been living here for 12 years now \u2014 and I am still in awe and disbelief [about] how amazing public libraries are here.\" This comment spurred a long thread of chatter. One person wrote, \"In my area (and I'm sure in others in the U.S.), if my local library doesn't have what I want, they will obtain it from another library in the state for me free of charge.\" Another individual cited \"the size, resources, funding and amount of items that can be checked out\" as a positive. NEW JERSEY MAN RETURNS BORROWED BOOK TO HIS PUBLIC LIBRARY 75 YEARS LATE \"Good libraries in the U.S. have obviously a huge variety of books, but can also have computer services, 3D printing, telescopes, tools, boardgames, videogames, movies, career services \u2014 and host all kinds of events and programs throughout the year.\" Said another person, \"Many libraries also have items you can check out online if you have a library card. I've listened to a number of audiobooks without having to actually set foot in the library.\" The same person wrote, \"They also offer e-books, which is great.\" This individual continued, \"And some libraries allow digital access even if you're not in the immediate area. I know the Brooklyn Library and New York Public Library both allow digital access to residents of New York State, even if you're outside the NYC area.\" Someone else wrote, \"Which makes it a shame that so many people are frothing at the mouth to have them defunded and erased. Libraries are one of the few services provided by civilization that you shouldn't have to inherently pay money to enjoy.\" On the topic of America's national parks, scores of posters got involved in the chatter. One Redditor said simply, \"Yellowstone.\" The person then added, \"Yellowstone is like being on an entirely different planetat times, with a ridiculous amount of flora and fauna that either want to eat you or build a nest in your car \u2014 not to mention the geysers and springs.\" This person added, \"It's absolutely essential viewing and God bless Teddy Roosevelt.\" ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, TEDDY ROOSEVELT SHOT IN CHEST, MAKES CAMPAIGN STOP MINUTES LATER Another person wrote, \"We have a bit of everything, deserts, forests, swamps, mountains, tropical (Hawaii), etc.\" \"Access to public education forchildren with special needs,\" wrote one poster, \"is a right guaranteed by law, and those protections are stronger and the educational services for special needs children are better than in most of the rest of the world.\" The poster added, \"The ADA [Americans with Disabilities Act] is also pretty amazing, and the United States is a lot more accessible than most other countries.

The federal panel tossed some of the constitutional claims in the lawsuit challenging the redistricting plan approved by the majority-Republican Legislature last year. The lawsuit filed by twoBlack Democratic lawmakersand four other residents claimed the new map violates the Constitution and the federal Voting Rights Act by moving 23,000 predominantly Black voters out of the 2nd District in central Arkansas. Those voters were split between the state\u2019s 1st and 4th congressional districts. TRIAL BEGINS OVER ARKANSAS BAN ON GENDER-CONFIRMING SURGERY FOR CHILDREN The ruling gave the residents 30 days to file an amended complaint focusing on their remaining claims that the new map violatesthe Constitutionand the federal Voting Rights Act.

        " \n        By\n        Peter Kasperowicz   | Fox News ",
        " More than a dozen House Democrats have put forward legislation that would give theDepartment of Health and Human Services$20 million a year to wage a public awareness campaign promoting abortion. The bill from Reps. Lori Trahan, D-Mass., and Lisa Blunt Rochester, D-Del., is an attempt to get the federal government involved in helping people access abortion services in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling that struck down Roe v. Wade. That rulingleft abortion rights to the states, but the Democratic bill proposes that HHS help doctors and patients \"navigate the legal landscape\" as they seek abortions. \"Health care providers simply trying to care for their patients are being forced to navigate a patchwork of new bans and limitations on abortion care, some of which could land them in jail just for doing their jobs,\" Trahan said Tuesday. She said the bill would ensure doctors have the \"guidance and assurance necessary to provide reproductive care for their patients in a constantly changing legal landscape.\" CONGRESSMAN DEMANDS RECORDS FROM DOJ DETAILING FACE ACT ABORTION PROSECUTIONS: \u2018EASILY WEAPONIZED\u2019 According to the bill, HHS would also play a role in \"the dissemination of information on the negative health impacts on communities whenaccess to abortion and other reproductive health care servicesis restricted or banned.\" \"[T]he health care professionals whose duty it is to provide reproductive services, support, and resources are now facing an uphill battle \u2013 and in some states, potential criminal charges \u2013 to provide that essential reproductive care,\" said Blunt Rochester. She said states run by Republicans have \"jumped at the chance to strip millions of women of their fundamental right to make their own reproductive health care decisions through extreme abortion bans.\" ABRAMS SCORCHED FOR SUGGESTING ABORTION ALLEVIATES INFLATION: \u2018POSITIVELY GHOULISH\u2019 The bill would give HHS $20 million per year through fiscal years 2023 to 2027, for a total of $100 million. Democrats have been hopeful that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on abortion will give them an advantage in the midterm elections that are expected to favor Republicans in light of rising inflation and broader economic dissatisfaction. President Biden last week made a push to rally Democratic voters by saying a result that lets them keep the majority in the House and Senate would let them take up votes on abortion. \"If we do that, here\u2019s the promise I make to you and the American people: The first bill I will send to the Congress will be to codify Roe v. Wade,\" Biden said. However, abortion is not rivaling inflation, high gas prices and other economic issues. Recent polls say more voters are breaking for Republicans in these last few weeks before the vote. Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who votes with Democrats, said this week that Democrats should be focusing on these economic issues more than they have been. SANDERS: DEMS SHOULD PUSH ECONOMIC MESSAGE, NOT JUST FOCUS ON ABORTION CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"I think what the Democrats have got to say is, 'We are gonna stand with working people, we\u2019re prepared to take on the drug companies, we\u2019re prepared to take on the insurance companies, and create an economy that works for all of us,\" Sanders said. \"Is the abortion issue important? Yes,\" he said. \"But we have also got to focus on the struggles of working people to put food on their table.\"",

    "Fetterman lowers expectations ahead of only debate with Oz in Pennsylvania Senate showdown": [
        " \n        By\n        Paul Steinhauser   | Fox News ",
        " The Democratic Senate nominee in arguably the most crucial and high-profileSenate electionthis year is lowering expectations ahead of the one and only debate with his Republican counterpart. Five months after suffering a stroke that could have taken his life, Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman on Tuesday will share the same stage with Mehmet Oz, the cardiac surgeon, celebrity doctor, and Republican nominee in the race to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey. The race in the key northeastern battleground state \u2013 where the latest public opinion polls indicate Oz has all but erased Fetterman\u2019s one-time lead \u2013 is one of a handful across the country that will likely determine if the Republicans win back the Senate majority in themidterm elections. The debate, held in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, comes with just two weeks to go until Election Day and early voting underway, with more than a half million Keystone State voters already casting ballots. And it\u2019s one of four debates across the county on Tuesday in key Senate and gubernatorial races. THE SLEEPER SENATE RACES THAT WILL DETERMINE THE CHAMBER'S MAJORITY While Fetterman\u2019s physically recovered from his stroke and weeks ago resumed a busy campaign schedule, he still stumbles over words and uses closed captioning to read interview questions, which experts say is common for people recovering from strokes. Fetterman\u2019s campaign, in a memo on the eve of the debate, noted that as requested, closed captioning will be provided to Fetterman during the one-hour showdown. THESE 11 SENATE RACES WILL LIKELY DETERMINE WHICH PARTY CONTROLS THE MAJORITY \"The captioning process may also lead to time delays and errors in the exchanges between the moderators and the candidates,\" the Fetterman campaign cautioned. \"In fact, because the captions are going to be typed out by human beings in real time, on live TV, some amount of human error in the transcription is inevitable, which may cause temporary miscommunications at times. It is impossible to control and unavoidable.\" Pointing to Fetterman\u2019s past debate performances, his campaign argued that \"this isn\u2019t John\u2019s format. Look no further than the debates from the primary earlier this year.\" And highlighting the GOP nominee's many years as the star of daytime TV\u2019s popular \"Dr. Oz Show,\" the Fetterman campaign argued that \"this guy is a media-savvy performer who literally built his career (and his fortune) by playing to the cameras as a daytime TV host.\" Fetterman enjoyed a healthy polling and fundraising lead over Oz during the summer, as the Republican nominee struggled to consolidate his party\u2019s support after narrowly winning a crowded and very combustible primary showdown in the spring after he was endorsed byformer President Donald Trump. But over the past couple of months, Oz and his campaign have been relentless in attacking Fetterman for dodging debates. \"Tomorrow night will be the first and only debate in the Pennsylvania U.S. Senate race after John Fetterman dodged 7 debates in a desperate attempt to hide his radical policies from scrutiny by the media and Pennsylvanians,\" the Oz campaign charged on Monday. And the Oz campaign has lambasted Fetterman in recent weeks over his record as lieutenant governor and earlier as mayor of the Pittsburgh area borough of Braddock. \"At tonight's debate, John Fetterman is going to tell lie after lie as he tries to cover up the radical policies he pushed for as the no-show mayor of Braddock and no-show lieutenant governor,\" the Oz campaign claimed hours before the debate. Veteran national Republican media consultant John Brabender expects the debate to break through all the noise in the closing weeks of the Pennsylvania Senate showdown. \"For almost a year now, people have been inundated first with the primary ads and then the general election ads in the Senate race from not only the candidates but countless independent expenditure groups. And at this point they\u2019ve been beaten into submission as far as new information. However, the debate will be seen as more authentic and believable than the ads,\" he emphasized. CHECK OUT THE LATEST FOX NEWS MIDTERMS POWER RANKINGS Brabender, whose offices are headquartered in Pennsylvania, forecast that \"there\u2019s a better chance that somebody will make a mistake that will cost them the election rather than somebody who will have such a stellar performance that they\u2019ll win the election.\" Thedebate in Pennsylvaniais the most high-profile of a handful of debates on Tuesday in key races across the country. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and GOP challenger Tudor Dixon face off for the second and final time in a one-hour debate. Dixon, a businesswoman and conservative commentator who won the state\u2019s Republican gubernatorial primary thanks in part to an endorsement and support from Trump, is banking on a late surge of support to try and oust Whitmer, a former state lawmaker who enjoys a large fundraising advantage over her GOP challenger. REPUBLICANS SEE DIVERSITY AS A KEY TO WINNING BACK THE HOUSE Whitmer has blasted Dixon for months over abortion, and during their first debate the candidates traded fire over that issue, as well as education, school safety, gun measures, and Whitmer\u2019s record on dealing with the coronavirus pandemic The latest public opinion polls in the midwestern battleground state indicate that Whitmer\u2019s lead is shrinking. It\u2019s a similar story in New York, where conservative GOP Rep. Lee Zeldin has narrowed the gap with Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul. Zeldin hopes to become the first Republican to win a gubernatorial election in blue-state New York in 20 years. Zeldin is expected to hammer Hochul over his top campaign issue \u2013 rising crime and New York\u2019s bail reform laws \u2013 when they face off Tuesday in their one and likely only debate. Hochul, formerly the state\u2019s lieutenant governor, was sworn in as New York\u2019s first female governor after three-term Democratic Gov.Andrew Cuomoresigned in disgrace amid multiple scandals last year.

And they\u2019re not making a secret of it,\" said Clinton. \"The right-wing-controlled Supreme Court may be poised to rule on giving state legislatures the power to overturn presidential elections.\" The claim comes as theSupreme Courtis hearing a case this term that could give state legislatures more power in regulating federal elections.

The former secretary of state is teaming up with Indivisible to flip several state legislatures to prevent such an outcome.

        " \n        By\n        Michael Lee   | Fox News ",
        " A wildlife expert is blaming an unprovoked bear attack, that resulted in severe injuries to a woman walking her dog inWashington state,on \"woke\" politics. \"Public safety is no longer a priority in Olympia, it seems,\" Tom Nelson, who hosts The Outdoor Line on ESPN Radio, told KIRO Monday. At issue was a blackbear attackover the weekend in a residential area of Leavenworth, Washington, where a 68-year-old woman walking her dog sustained \"significant injuries\" and was hospitalized. The woman's terrifying fight with the bear lasted roughly 15 seconds, with the woman punching the animal several times before it finally ran off. Wildlife officials then used a Karelian bear dog to track the animal. The bear was located later that morning with two cubs, with officials capturing the cubs and killing the adult female bear. WASHINGTON WILDLIFE OFFICIALS KILL BLACK BEAR THAT ATTACKED WOMAN WALKING DOG Nelson believes the situation was preventable, but argued state officials have prioritized a \"touchy-feely, nonsensical woke wildlife management\" that is \"putting the public at risk.\" \"This is a complete tragedy on both sides. Nobody wins,\" Nelson said. \"Encounters like this\u2026 are avoidable.\" Nelson noted that fall is the time of year that bears \"pack on as much as they can because they\u2019re coming into hibernation.\" \"Their feeding drive is at a premium,\" Nelson said. \"Unfortunately, the lady got between a sow and her cubs, and that provoked the protection response.\" WYOMING'S PUSH TO DELIST GRIZZLY BEARS FROM ENDANGERED SPECIES LIST FACES OPPOSITION FROM ANTI-HUNTING GROUP However, Nelson argued that bears typically would not be desperate enough to enter residential areas near parks and risk encounters with humans if they were not desperate, something brought on by the state \"making political decisions about biological situations for political considerations.\" Nelson pointed out that state officials restricted the spring bearhunting seasonand passed laws that made it more difficult to hunt bears during the normal season. The result has been a steady increase in the population of bears, increasing the risks of similar negative human interactions with the animals. One of those rules the state passed to make hunting bears more difficult was banning theuse of dogsto pursue bears. Nelson noted that state officials are still able to use dogs to track bears involved in attacks, including the one over the weekend. \"All they\u2019ve done with regard to hounds is privatize this,\" Nelson said. \"Before, you had hunters that loved their dogs. It\u2019s amazingly difficult to hunt [bears] without the help of our four-footed friends.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"So, now, we as taxpayers have to pay for this activity rather than have the hunter \u2013 who is buying tags and licenses \u2013 providing money for the state.\" Reached for comment by Fox News, a spokesperson for the Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife stressed that such interactions \"are rare in Washington state as black bears tend to avoid humans.\" The spokesperson added that some bears have become \"human-habituated\" or \"human-food-conditioned\" and can \"become aggressive in their pursuit of a meal\" in populated or semi-populated areas, something the agency has attempted to address by educating the population on coexisting with the animals. \"Public safety is our priority; our officers and staff were quick to mobilize to locate the animal in this incident and secure the scene as we have a responsibility to our communities, it's an unfortunate circumstance and never the outcome we want,\" the spokesperson said.",

The opening of the in-person voting period marks the beginning of the final two-week push to Election Day in the swing state where both Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson and Democratic Gov.

In order to be counted, each absentee ballot must include the signature and address of a witness. The elections commission had issued guidance in 2016 saying clerks could fill in that information. But the judge ruled that because state law does not allow for that to be done, the guidance was illegal. WISCONSIN SHERIFF'S DEPUTY FATALLY SHOOTS WEAPONS VIOLATION SUSPECT There are two pending lawsuits over how much of the witness\u2019s address must be present in order for the clerk to accept the ballot. The elections commission has said an address is the street number, street name and municipality. But one lawsuit, filed by the League of Women Voters of Wisconsin, seeks a ruling on what constitutes a missing address, arguing that clerks should accept anything short of a completely blank address. The legal fight has led to confusion among some clerks about what ballots they can accept or reject for missing information. A judge in that lawsuit planned to announce her ruling Wednesday, after she previously voiced concerns about creating confusion after voting has begun. More than 238,000 absentee ballots had been returned as of Monday, according to theWisconsin Elections Commission. That equates to a return rate of 52% as of 15 days before the election. At this point in 2020, 62% of requested absentee ballots had been returned, but that was also during the first year of the pandemic when the use of absentee balloting surged to previously unseen levels. Democrats scheduled a rally Tuesday in the Democratic stronghold of Milwaukee in an effort to drive up early voting there. Evers, Barnes and Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union, planned to hold an event with union workers before going to vote early at Fiserv Forum. It\u2019s one of a series of events in battleground states focused on the fight to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Johnson planned a rally in a conservative Milwaukee suburb, a crucial area for Republicans needed to bluntDemocratic turnout in Milwaukeeand liberal Madison. Michels had no scheduled events Tuesday but did plan a Wednesday rally scheduled in Waukesha, a Republican-rich Milwaukee suburb, with Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin. A series of other surrogates for both sides planned events. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Former President Barack Obama planned a Saturday rally with Democratic candidates in Milwaukee. Obama recently cut television ads for both Evers and Barnes. There are no announced plans for President Joe Biden, who won Wisconsin in 2020 but whose approval ratings are below 50%, to campaign in the state. Likewise, formerPresident Donald Trumphas endorsed both Michels and Johnson but has no announced plans to campaign in the state. His approval rating is even lower than Biden's, based on the latest Marquette University Law School poll.",

    "Mainstream media frustrated by voters as midterms break in GOP\u2019s direction": [
        " \n        By\n        Howard Kurtz   | Fox News ",
        " If you cut through all the noise, it seems to me that the media are starting to get mad at the voters. There\u2019s a growing gap between the hair-on-fire pronouncements of the press and the things that people tell pollsters they\u2019re concerned about, which are mainly issues thatfavor the Republicans. In stories, in segments, in columns, in tweets, you can sense the frustration that voters are insufficiently concerned about what the mainstream media view as looming threats. What about abortion rights? What about election deniers? What about Jan. 6? Whatabout Donald Trump?What about the danger to democracy?? SAUDI CROWN PRINCE REPORTEDLY MOCKED PRESIDENT OVER GAFFES, QUESTIONED MENTAL STATE Not to mention, what about President Biden\u2019s record of accomplishments? Why isn\u2019t that helping?? I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s unfair for journalists and commentators to raise any of these things. But they also have to recognize that many voters aren\u2019tbuying into their agenda\u2013 and that the media folks have been trapped in something of a bubble.With 44% in a recent New York Times poll naming inflation or the economy as their top issue \u2013 and abortion at just 5% \u2013 it\u2019s clear why the election is breaking in the GOP\u2019s direction. And by the way, this is hardly unusual in a midterm election, when resentment at the party in power would cause a significant loss of seats. (Keep in mind that Kevin McCarthy just needs a net gain of five to become the next speaker, andMitch McConnell needs onlya pickup of one seat to regain the post of majority leader.) As Steve Krakauer, citing a Monmouth poll, says in his Fourth Watch newsletter: \"Just 8 percent of Americans say their opinions about that day have been changed by the committee's hearings - the exact same as in August and up from 6 percent in June. 44 percent say they have no faith the committee could conduct a fair hearing - that's the highest number yet, up 8 percent since August. But most importantly, just 36 percent of Americans say Donald Trump is \u2018directly responsible\u2019 for what happened that day, a percentage that has been progressivelydecliningsince the hearings started. The Acela Media is more out of touch than ever.\" Case in point: Tom Nichols of the Atlantic tweeted: \"The United States is facing the greatest dangerto its constitutional systemsince at least the 1950s, if not the *18*50s, and millions of people are like: Yeah, but gas, man.\" Sure, there\u2019s been a grudging recognition that Republicans have the momentum. But that\u2019s accompanied by a sense of disbelief. One example: It was big news when the House Jan. 6 committee, at its mostly-rehash final hearing, agreed to subpoena Trump. But then CNN and MSNBC went wall to wall when the panel formally approved the subpoena, though nothing had changed. Most voters aren\u2019t hanging on every procedural development (and everyone knows Trump\u2019s not showing up anyway). PELOSI ACCUSES TRUMP OF NOT BEING 'MAN ENOUGH' TO APPEAR IN FRONT OF JAN. 6 COMMITTEE On Biden\u2019s legislative record,it\u2019s true that he has pushed through a whole lot of bipartisan legislation: on infrastructure, on gun safety, on computer chips, on helping ailing veterans. And that\u2019s pushed his approval rating up to the mid-40s. But a lot of that seems abstract when gas and grocery prices are rising, and few Democrats are asking for his campaign help. On the economy, the president is naturally talking up what he thinks has gone right, saying yesterday that he\u2019d help create 10 million new jobs and playing down the chances of a recession. But this can come across as a lack of concern about inflation, which he once dismissed as \"transitory.\" But Trump remains clickbait gold for news outlets whose traffic surged during his presidency. On yesterday\u2019s Washington Post home page, the most popular story was Bob Woodward\u2019s essay on why he\u2019s releasing an audio book of Trump tapes (he now finds the former president an \"unparalleled danger\"). No. 4 was a column on Liz Cheney ripping Trump and his acolytes on \"Meet the Press.\" When Biden gave an exclusive interview to MSNBC, host Jonathan Capehart spent nearly all of it inviting the president to slam Trump and MAGA Republicans as a danger to democracy. No media critics batted an eye. SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF ON THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES It\u2019s not that journalists and commentators are openly berating voters for not seeing the light. There\u2019s just a sense of befuddlement that they are not sufficiently exercised at the clear and present danger to democracy: How can this be happening? Don\u2019t you people realize what\u2019s at stake? Keep in mind that most Republicans believe Trump\u2019s totally unproven argument thatthe election was illegitimateand it\u2019s the other side that\u2019s telling the Big Lie. An NBC News pollover the weekend found 80% of Democrats and Republicans said they believe the political opposition poses a threat that, if not stopped, will destroy America as we know it.

        " The Democratic Party'sfar-left wingurged President Biden to secure a peace agreement in Ukraine on Monday, throwing the party into disarray regarding the conflict. Thirty progressive members of the House of Representatives, including Reps. Pramila Jayapal Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, R-NY, sent a letter to Biden on the issue Monday. The group called on the White House to pursue\"direct engagement\" with Russiato secure a peace deal, flaunting the current policy of the Biden White House. \"We agree with the Administration\u2019s perspective that it is not America\u2019s place to pressure Ukraine\u2019s government regarding sovereign decisions, and with the principle you have enunciated that there should be \u2018nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine,'\" the group wrote. \"But as legislators responsible for the expenditure of tens of billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars in military assistance in the conflict, we believe such involvement in this war also creates a responsibility for the United States to seriously explore all possible avenues, including direct engagement with Russia, to reduce harm and support Ukraine in achieving a peaceful settlement,\" they added. IRANIAN TROOPS IN CRIMEA TRAINING RUSSIANS ON DRONE STRIKES AGAINST UKRAINE, WHITE HOUSE SAYS Jayapal's letter faced speedy condemnation from fellow Democrats, \"This letter is an olive branch to a war criminal who\u2019s losing his war,\" Rep. Jake Auchincloss, D-Mass., wrote on Twitter. One signee of the letter, Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wisc., expressed confusion as to why it had been published. \"This was written in July & I have no idea why it went out now. Bad timing,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"Second, it was trying to get to a cease-fire & diplomacy as others were banging war drums, not criticizing Biden. Third, I\u2019ve supported the efforts & will continue. Over-analyzed by some.\" Democrats have repeatedly pushed tens of billions in military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine through Congress since Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded the country in February. WHITE HOUSE ACCUSES IRAN OF GIFTING 'SEVERAL HUNDRED' DRONES TO RUSSIA While the initial funding boosts were bipartisan, the griping letter from progressives echoes a growing sentiment among Republicans that the spending needs to be controlled. The U.S. has invested roughly $54 billion into supporting Ukraine with military and humanitarian aid. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy stated that Ukraine would no longer be getting a \"blank check\" if Republicans secure Congress in November. \"I think people are gonna be sitting in a recession and they\u2019re not going to write a blank check to Ukraine,\" McCarthy told Punchbowl News last week. \"They just won\u2019t do it. \u2026 It\u2019s not a free blank check.\" Nevertheless, Republicans have clarified that they are not opposed to offering further aid to Ukraine. Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio,argued Monday that the problem for many GOP lawmakers was not aiding Ukraine in its hour of need but rather the expensive way Democrats have done so in recent months. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"No one in Republican leadership has called for an end to aid for Ukraine,\" said Turner. \"People on the Republican side are saying, \u2018Why do we have to pass a $40 billion package to send $8 billion to Ukraine?\u2019\" Fox News' Haris Alic contributed to this report.",

    "Ash Carter, defense chief who opened combat to women, dies": [
        "By TARA COPPOctober 25, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Former Defense Secretary Ash Carter, whoopened combat jobs to womenandended a banon transgender people serving in the military, has died at age 68. Carter died Monday evening after suffering a heart attack in Boston, his family said in a statement Tuesday. Known as a defense thinker and strategist, Carter was a nuclear expert, three-time Pentagon executive, budget guru and academician who had served as a defense civilian in the building over a period of 35 years. Gen. Martin Dempsey, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, noted at Carter\u2019s retirement ceremony in 2017 that his focus on the less glamourous aspects of the job such as people management had made him known as the \u201cmost important, least known figure in Washington.\u201d Carter had not previously served in the military but mastered the nuts and bolts of the Defense Department, a skill set that helped him quietly shape notable change, particularly when it came to who was allowed to serve in uniform. In December 2015, after three years of study and debate, Carter ordered the military to open all jobs to women, removing the final barriers that kept women from serving in combat, including the most dangerous and grueling commando posts. \u201cI made the decision to admit women to all military specialties without exception,\u201d Carter said in a later interview on the decision. \u201cThey are 50% of the population. We can\u2019t afford to leave off the table half of the population who can, if they\u2019re the ones who have the best qualifications, do the job.\u201d The following year, Carter, was responsible for ending the ban on transgender troops, saying it was the right thing to do. \u201cAmericans who want to serve and can meet our standards should be afforded the opportunity to compete to do so,\u201d Carter said in June 2016, laying out a one-year plan to implement the change. \u201cOur mission is to defend this country, and we don\u2019t want barriers unrelated to a person\u2019s qualification to serve preventing us from recruiting or retaining the soldier, sailor, airman or Marine who can best accomplish the mission.\u201d Before Carter was named defense secretary, he served in President Barack Obama\u2019s administration as the Pentagon\u2019s top procurement officer and oversaw the department\u2019s effort to speed more than 24,000 Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles to Iraq and Afghanistan during the height of both conflicts to better protect U.S. troops. At the time, thousands of U.S. troops were being maimed or killed by roadside bombs because there was not adequate protection in the vehicles they were operating. Carter frequently mentioned the rapid development and procurement of those vehicles as one of his proudest accomplishments. \u201cAt peak production, the United States shipped over 1,000 MRAPs a month to theater. And there, they saved lives,\u201d Carter said at a 2012 ceremony marking the completion of the vehicle production. \u201cAnd you all know me, I would have driven one in here today, if I could get it through the door.\u201d Obama said in a statement Tuesday that he \u201crelied on Ash\u2019s strategic counsel as we invested in innovation and a stronger, smarter, more humane, and more effective military for the long term.\u201d On at least one occasion, Carter split with Obama on a notable issue: the decision to commute the 35-year prison sentence of Chelsea Manning. Manning was convicted in 2013 of espionage for leaking classified information while deployed in Iraq as an Army private. Carter, a native of Philadelphia, served as the 25th defense secretary and \u201cloved nothing more than spending time with the troops, making frequent trips to Iraq and Afghanistan to visit U.S. forces with his wife Stephanie,\u201d his family said in a statement. \u201cCarter always set politics aside; he served presidents of both parties over five administrations.\u201d Carter was sworn in as defense secretary in February 2015. He was immediately confronted with the rise of the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria and China\u2019s rapid militarization of islands in the South China Sea. During his tenure Carter oversaw the Obama administration\u2019s \u201cPivot to the Pacific,\u201d an attempt to rebalance military resources and focus on a rising China. He traveled multiple times to U.S. aircraft carriers in the Pacific as the U.S. increased its naval presence there to counter Beijing\u2019s own more aggressive stance. However, his continued focus on process reform and military modernization, including the establishment of a new defense innovation hub to get Silicon Valley more directly tied to the Pentagon, was sometimes criticized as out of touch as the military shifted again into an intensified conflict in the Middle East. \u201cI think he will be long remembered in the halls of the Pentagon as a visionary,\u201d said former Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James, who led the Air Force during Carter\u2019s tenure as defense secretary as they announced the Pentagon would develop the nation\u2019s first new strategic stealth bomber in decades, the B-21 Raider. It is scheduled to be unveiled to the public this December. Carter earned bachelor\u2019s degrees in physics and in medieval history, summa cum laude, at Yale University, and received a doctorate in theoretical physics from Oxford University. Carter was a Rhodes Scholar, a physics instructor at Oxford University, and a post doctoral fellow at Rockefeller University and M.I.T., and an experimental research associate at Brookhaven and Fermilab National Laboratories. Carter had most recently served as the director of Harvard University\u2019s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. He is survived by his wife, Stephanie and two children. \u2014\u2014 Associated Press writer Lolita Baldor contributed to this report from Washington.",

    "Most in US want more action on climate change: AP-NORC poll": [
        "By MATTHEW DALY and NUHA DOLBYOctober 25, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Nearly two-thirds of Americans think the federal government is not doing enough to fight climate change, according to a new poll that shows limited public awareness about a sweeping new law that commits the U.S. to its largest ever investment to combat global warming. Democrats in Congress approvedthe Inflation Reduction Actin August, handing President Joe Biden a hard-fought triumph on priorities that his party hopes will bolster prospects for keeping their House and Senate majorities in November\u2019s elections. Biden and Democratic lawmakers havetouted the new law as a milestone achievementleading into the midterm elections, and environmental groups have spent millions to boost the measure in battleground states. Yet the poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that 61% of U.S. adults say they know little to nothing about it. While the law was widely heralded as the largest investment in climate spending in history, 49% of Americans say it won\u2019t make much of a difference on climate change, 33% say it will help and 14% think it will do more to hurt it. The measure, which passed without a single Republican vote in either chamber, offers nearly $375 billion in incentives to accelerate expansion of clean energy such as wind and solar power, speeding the transition away from fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas that largely cause climate change. Combined with spending by states and the private sector, the law could help shrink U.S. carbon emissions by about two-fifths by 2030 and chop emissions from electricity by as much as 80%, advocates say. Michael Katz, 84, of Temple, New Hampshire, said he thinks Biden has \u201cdone an amazing amount of work\u201d as president. \u201cI\u2019m sort of in awe of what he\u2019s done,\u2033 said Katz, a Democrat and retired photographer. Still, asked his opinion of the Inflation Reduction Act, Katz said, \u201cI\u2019m not acquainted with\u201d it. After learning about the law\u2019s provisions, Katz said he supports increased spending for wind and solar power, along with incentives to purchase electric vehicles. Katz said he supports even stronger measures \u2014 such as restrictions on rebuilding incoastal areas damaged by Hurricane Ianor other storms \u2014 but doubts they will ever be approved. \u201cPeople want their dreams to come true: to live near the ocean in a big house,\u2033 he said. Leah Stokes, an environmental policy professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, said she was not surprised the climate law is so little known, despite massive media coverage when it was debated in Congress, approved and signed by Biden. The law was passed during the summer, when people traditionally pay less attention to news, \u201cand it takes time to explain it,\u2033 especially since many of the law\u2019s provisions have not yet kicked in, Stokes said. Biden and congressional Democrats \u201cdelivered in a big way on climate,\u2033 she said, but now must focus on helping the public understand the law and \u201cwinning the win.\u2033 Meredith McGroarty, a waitress from Pontiac, Michigan, said she knew little about the new law but supports increased climate action. \u201cI have children I\u2019m leaving behind to this world,\u2033 she said. McGroarty, 40, a Democrat, urged Biden and other leaders to talk more about the climate law\u2019s \u201ceffects on normal, everyday people. Let us know what\u2019s going on a little more.\u2033 Americans are generally more likely to support than oppose many of the government actions on climate change included in the law, the poll shows. That includes incentives for electric vehicles and solar panels, though relatively few say they are inclined to pursue either in the next three years. About half of Americans think government action that targets companies with restrictions is very important, the poll shows, while about a third say that about restrictions on individuals. A majority of Americans, 62%, say companies\u2019 refusal to reduce energy use is a major problem for efforts to reduce climate change, while just about half say people not willing to reduce their energy use is a major problem. Slightly more than half also say it\u2019s a major problem that the energy industry is not doing enough to supply power from renewable sources such as wind and solar, and about half say the government is not investing enough in renewable energy. Overall, 62% of U.S. adults say the government is doing too little to reduce climate change, while 19% say it\u2019s doing too much and 18% think it\u2019s doing the right amount. Democrats are more likely than others to think the federal government is doing too little on climate: 79% say that, compared to 67% of independents and 39% of Republicans. About three-quarters of Black and Hispanic Americans think there\u2019s too little action, compared to about half of white Americans. And about three-quarters of adults under 45 think there\u2019s too little action on climate, significantly higher than the roughly half of those older who think that. Robert Stavins, a professor of energy and economic development at the Harvard Kennedy School, said it makes sense for the government to step in to promote renewable energy on a large scale. \u201cIndividual action is not going to be sufficient in 10 or even 20 years,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need government policies to create incentives for industry and individuals to move in a carbon-friendly direction.\u2033 Americans want to own a car, \u201cand they are not going to buy one that\u2019s expensive,\u2033 Stavins said, so government needs to lower costs for electric vehicles and encourage automakers to produce more EVs, including widespread availability of charging stations. Biden has set a goal toinstall 500,000 charging stations across Americaas part of the 2021 infrastructure law. On renewable energy, nearly two-thirds of U.S. adults say offshore wind farms should be expanded, and about 6 in 10 say solar panel farms should be expanded. Biden has moved toexpand offshore windandsolar poweras president. Americans are divided on offshore drilling for oil and natural gas. Around a third say such drilling should be expanded, while about as many say it should be reduced; another third say neither. Republicans were more likely than Democrats to be in favor of expanding offshore drilling, 54% to 20%. ___ The poll of 1,003 adults was conducted Sep. 9-12 using a sample drawn from NORC\u2019s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.

Biden was to appear at the White House with the doctors who are leading administration efforts against thespread of the coronavirus. They were set to be joined by executives from several major drug store chains, which are mounting renewed efforts to help people to get a dose of COVID-19 vaccine that\u2019s been reformulated to target the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of omicron, the most dominant strains in the United States. Over 20 million people, including nearly 1 in 5 older adults, have already gotten the updated COVID-19 booster, the White House said. Biden is expected to again call on business, educational and civil leaders to do more toencourage their communities to get the updated vaccines,which are free of charge. Three respiratory viruses are currently circulating in the U.S: the flu, COVID-19 and RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, said Dr. Ashish Jha, leader of the White House response to COVID-19. Jha said during several morning TV show appearances that the combination of a flu shot and updated COVID booster now will help people avoid serious illness and stay out of the hospital as they get ready to celebrate Thanksgiving and other holidays with friends and family. RSV has been affecting children, but there is not shot available to treat it, though companies are working to develop one, he said. \u201cSo if people went out and got their vaccines, we could really get through this without getting into a lot of trouble,\u201d Jha said Tuesday on \u201cCBS Mornings.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re relying on your old vaccine from nine months ago or an infection from a year ago, that\u2019s probably not going to be good enough and that\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019re urging all Americans \u2014 but particularly older Americans, particularly seniors \u2014 to get the new updated COVID vaccine, because I do think it\u2019s going to make a really big difference,\u201d Jha said on \u201cToday\u201d on NBC. Biden had to wait a few months to get his updated COVID booster because he was infected, then reinfected, with COVID-19 over the summer.

    "Obama endorses Beasley in crucial Senate race for Democrats": [
        "By HANNAH SCHOENBAUMOctober 25, 2022 GMT",
        " RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Former President Barack Obama endorsedNorth Carolina U.S. Senate candidate Cheri Beasleyon Tuesday in a new campaign ad as Democrats target the Southern swing state as one of the few where they have a strong shot at flipping a seat in the evenly split chamber. North Carolina, which Obama narrowly won in 2008, has one of the nation\u2019s most competitive Senate contests in themidterm elections.Beasley, the former chief justice of the state Supreme Court, is running againstRepublican U.S. Rep. Ted Budd, who has former President Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement. With Republicans projected to make gains in the House in November, Beasley\u2019s race is an essential pickup for Senate Democrats whohope to retain control of at least one chamber. As her opponent leans into his Trump ties \u2014 a move political analysts say could alienate themoderate and independent voters who often decide elections in swing states\u2014 Beasley\u2019s campaign said it plans to spend six figures broadcasting Obama\u2019s endorsement statewide. Beginning Tuesday, the campaign will air a 60-second ad voiced by the former president on social media and a 30-second cut on digital platforms and radio. \u201cCheri works hard, she\u2019s honest and, most importantly, she always puts people first,\u201d Obama says in the 60-second ad. \u201cIn the Senate, Cheri will fight to make health care and prescription drugs more affordable and protect our fundamental rights, from the right to vote to a woman\u2019s right to control her own body. This is going to be a close race, and we can\u2019t afford to get it wrong.\u201d The former president\u2019s support comes two weeks before Election Day, with in-person early voting already underway in North Carolina. He has also cut endorsement ads for Democratic Senate candidates John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Mandela Barnes of Wisconsin. The ad is part of a wider effort to engage and mobilize Black voters in the Tar Heel state, the Beasley campaign told The Associated Press, including church visits and meetings with members of historically Black fraternities and sororities known as \u201cThe Divine Nine.\u201d Obama has not indicated whether he will travel to North Carolina to campaign for Beasley in the final days of the 2022 campaign cycle. He plans to makeseveral stopsin other states with competitive senatorial and gubernatorial races this week and next, including a visit to Georgia on Oct. 28, Wisconsin and Michigan on Oct. 29 and Nevada on Nov. 1. ___ Hannah Schoenbaum is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.Report for Americais a nonprofit national service program that places journalists in local newsrooms to report on undercovered issues.

    "Chinese officers charged in plot to obstruct US Huawei probe": [
        "By ERIC TUCKER and NOMAAN MERCHANTOctober 25, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Two suspected Chinese intelligence officers have been charged with attempting to obstruct a U.S. criminal investigation of Chinese tech giant Huawei by offering bribes to someone they thought could provide inside information, the Justice Department said. The defendants are accused of paying tens of thousands of dollars in digital currency, along with cash and jewelry, to a U.S. official they thought they had recruited as an asset. But the person was a double agent working for the FBI, the department said. That prosecution, as well as two other cases involving Chinese operatives, was highlighted Monday at a news conference that featured the heads of both the FBI and the Justice Department, a rare joint presence reflecting a concerted American show of force against Chinese intelligence efforts. Washington has long accused Beijing ofinterfering in U.S. political affairs and stealing secretsand intellectual property. Besides the two men on Monday, 11 other Chinese nationals have been charged with offenses in the last week, including harassment of people in the U.S., that FBI Director Christopher Wray said show that China\u2019s \u201ceconomic assaults and their rights violations are part of the same problem.\u201d \u201cThey try to silence anyone who fights back against their theft \u2014 companies, politicians, individuals \u2014 just as they try to silence anyone who fights back against their other aggressions,\u201d he said. The latest announcements came just days after Xi Jinping awarded himself a third term as leader of China\u2019s Communist Party, though Wray dismissed the idea of a possible connection in the timing, noting \u201cwe bring cases when they\u2019re ready.\u201d \u201cIf the Chinese government, the Chinese Communist Party, continues to violate our laws, they\u2019re going to keep encountering the FBI,\u201d he said. A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, Liu Pengyu, accused the U.S. of using \u201cstate power to unreasonably suppress non-U.S. companies.\u201d \u201cThis goes against market principles and is a blatant act of bullying,\u201d Liu said in a statement. \u201cChina firmly opposes this. The Chinese government will continue to firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises.\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin did not discuss the specifics of the Huawei case at a briefing Tuesday but said \u201cwe always oppose the U.S. overstretching the concept of national security and abusing state power to unwarrantedly suppress Chinese companies.\u201d More generally, he said, the Chinese government always asks its citizens to follow the laws of the countries where they reside, but he also accused the U.S. government of making up lies to smear China. In the Huawei case, Guochun He and Zheng Wang, are accused of trying to direct a U.S. official to supply confidential information about the Justice Department\u2019s investigation, including about witnesses, trial evidence and potential new charges. The Justice Department separately announced charges against four other Chinese nationals, accusing them of using the cover of an academic institute to try to procure sensitive technology and equipment as well as interfering with protests that \u201cwould have been embarrassing to the Chinese government.\u201d And it highlighteda case from last weekin which two additional people were arrested and five others charged with harassing someone living in the U.S. to return to China as part of whatBeijing callsOperation Fox Hunt. \u201cToday\u2019s cases make clear that Chinese agents will not hesitate to break the law and to violate international norms in the process,\u201d Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said. The case connected to the Huawei probe dates to January 2019. The company, a top executive and several subsidiaries had just been indicted on U.S. charges of financial fraud, trade secret theft and sanctions violations. Wang and He, according to prosecutors, were eager for non-public information about the prosecution and the status of the investigation. They reached out to a contact they had known since 2017, but the person, who was not identified by name, began working as a double agent and engaged in a back-and-forth with the defendants that was overseen by the FBI. Last year, prosecutors say, the person passed to the defendants a single-page document that appeared to be classified and that contained information about a purported Justice Department plan to charge and arrest Huawei executives who were living in China. The person said the document had been secretly photographed during a meeting with federal prosecutors. The document was prepared specifically for the purposes of the prosecution that was unsealed Monday, and the information in it was neither accurate nor an accurate reflection of any Justice Department plans, officials said. The company is not named in the charging documents, and prosecutors declined at Monday\u2019s news conference to name it, though the references make clear that it\u2019s Huawei. Spokespeople for Huawei and the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately return messages seeking comment. Huawei has previously called the federal investigation \u201cpolitical persecution, plain and simple.\u201d \u201cAttacking Huawei will not help the U.S. stay ahead of the competition,\u201d the company said ina statementpublished in 2020. In the case linked to Operation Fox Hunt, prosecutors say Chinese agents tried to intimidate an unnamed person and his family to return to China. Part of the plot, the U.S. alleges, involved having the person\u2019s nephew travel to the U.S. as part of a tour group to deliver threats that included, \u201cComing back and turning yourself in is the only way out.\u201d",

    "Fla. Gov. DeSantis refuses to commit to serving full term": [
        "By STEVE PEOPLES and ANTHONY IZAGUIRREOctober 25, 2022 GMT",
        " TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 A defiantFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantisrefused to commit to serving a full four-year term if reelected when pressed by his Democratic rival,Charlie Crist, at their only gubernatorial debate on Monday. Crist, a former congressman and one-term governor, accused DeSantis, a rising Republican star considered alikely 2024 presidential contender, of being too distracted by his national political ambitions to lead properly. DeSantis skirted several attempts by Crist to get him to say he\u2019d serve a full second term. \u201cI know that Charlie is interested in talking about 2024 and Joe Biden, but I just want to make things very, very clear: The only worn-out old donkey I\u2019m looking to put out to pasture is Charlie Crist,\u201d DeSantis said of his 66-year-old opponent. Later, Crist slapped back, \u201cYou won\u2019t even say if you want to be the governor of Florida after this election.\u201d There were several heated clashes during a raucous debate that covered the COVID-19 pandemic, abortion, crime, education and President Joe Biden. The meeting came on the first day of early voting across the state; already, more than 1.1 million votes have been cast, the most in the nation. The Florida governor\u2019s race may not be the nation\u2019s most competitive election this fall, but it is no less consequential for DeSantis, a 44-year-old Harvard-educated Republican who could launch a presidential bid in the coming months. He hopes to use a strong reelection victory on Nov. 8 in Florida, a state hecarried by just 32,000 votesout of 8.2 million cast four years ago, to demonstrate the breadth and strength of his support. DeSantis has benefited from demographic shifts across Florida, a perennial swing state that hasshifted to the rightduring his first term. Former President Donald Trump carried the state by more than 3 points in 2020 and Republicans now hold a registration advantage of nearly 300,000 voters. Monday\u2019s debate offered voters in Florida and beyond a rare opportunity to see DeSantis under pressure. Like many leading GOP officials across the nation this fall, he has limited unscripted moments in recent months, save for periodic interviews with friendly conservative media. The candidates faced each other from behind wooden lecterns in Fort Pierce, Florida\u2019s Sunrise Theater. Both men seemed to relish the hourlong fight, which was interrupted repeatedly by the rowdy audience. DeSantis\u2019 embrace of divisive cultural issues weighed heavily on the prime-time affair. The Republican governor specifically defended his record tobar transgender girls from competing on public school teamsintended for student athletes identified as girls at birth. He also fired back against Crist\u2019s criticism of laws DeSantis signed limiting discussions of race andsexual orientation in schoolsand his opposition to gender transition treatments for minors. \u201cYou think you know better than any physician or any doctor or any woman,\u201d Crist said. \u201cYou need to lead by uniting people, not dividing them.\u201d Yet DeSantis has delighted his supporters over and over with his extraordinary willingness to fight \u2014 whether facing political adversaries, the federal government or powerful Florida businesses. Crist, a former Republican governor who most recently served as a Democratic congressman, has tried to cast himself as a moderate alternative to lead the perennial swing state. DeSantis\u2019 leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic and Hurricane Ian were also charged topics. Crist noted that DeSantis closed businesses and schools across the state early on during the pandemic and then ignored science by opening them too soon, leading to tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths. \u201cWe had one of the highest death rates in America, Ron,\u201d Crist said. \u201cHe called for harsh shutdowns,\u201d DeSantis responded. \u201cIt would have thrown millions of Floridians into turmoil.\u201d Over and over, DeSantis also sought to link Crist to Biden, whose popularity is sagging in Florida and across the nation. \u201cCharlie Crist has voted with Joe Biden 100% of the time,\u201d DeSantis said, referring to the \u201cCrist-Biden agenda.\u201d The debate was postponed from earlier in the month because of Hurricane Ian, which left more than 100 people dead along the state\u2019s southwest coast. Thousands of homes were destroyed and several schools remain closed across Lee County, a major Republican stronghold. The Category 4 storm exposed flaws in the state\u2019s fragile property insurance market, which has lost more than $1 billion in each of the last two years. Hundreds of thousands of Floridians have had their policies dropped or not renewed. Crist accused DeSantis of failing to address the insurance crisis. DeSantis accused Crist of being away during the storm. \u201cHe was hiding out in Puerto Rico. He wasn\u2019t helping his community,\u201d DeSantis jabbed. When the discussion turned to gun violence, both candidates said they would support the death penalty for Florida school shooter Nikolas Cruz, who this month wassentenced to life in prisonfor murdering 17 people in the 2018 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland. DeSantis added that he would push the legislature to change state law requiringa unanimous jury for death sentences.That would put Florida in a distinct minority among the 27 states that still have the death penalty, where almost all require juror unanimity. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask the Florida legislature to amend that statute so that one juror doesn\u2019t have veto power over appropriate punishment,\u201d DeSantis said. Crist also sought to make abortion a key focus, following the playbook of Democrats across the nation in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s reversal of Roe v. Wade. In April, DeSantissigned a law banning abortionsat 15 weeks of pregnancy, with no exceptions for rape or incest. When asked by the moderator, DeSantis declined to say whether he supports a complete abortion ban. \u201cYou deserve a better governor who cares about freedom and your right to choose,\u201d Crist said. ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the elections at:https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections Check outhttps://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-electionsto learn more about the issues and factors at play in the 2022 midterm elections.",

    "Las Vegas at center of tight contests for Senate, governor": [
        "By MICHELLE L. PRICEOctober 25, 2022 GMT",
        " LAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 In a meeting hall just north of Las Vegas Boulevard, where casino-resorts tower like gleaming beacons of amusement, Ted Pappageorge laid out a darker, urgent call for action beforenext month\u2019s election. Pappageorge, leader of the heavily Latino casino workers\u2019 union, told the hundreds of union members this past weekend that Nevada\u2019s endangered Democratic Gov.Steve Sisolakand U.S. Sen.Catherine Cortez Mastohave been \u201cwarriors\u201d for workers whose jobs were hit hard by the pandemic while the Republicans who may defeat them in November are \u201cextreme.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight back. Are you ready to fight?\u201d Pappageorge said to cheers and claps as the bartenders, cooks, servers, and room cleaners prepared to knock doors and get out the vote on behalf of Nevada Democratic candidates, according to a video of the event. Across town at the same time, at a strip mall in a retirement community where golf carts share the street with cars, Joe Lombardo, the Republican candidate for governor, told a crowd of about 100 people: \u201cThis election, you have to ask one question: Is your life any better today than it was four years ago?\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d the audience yelled in response. \u201cThat\u2019s the common answer,\u201d Lombardo said. The dual rallies launched an intense two-week period of early voting in a state that may shape the nation\u2019s political future. Much of the focus is on Las Vegas, the gambling mecca that drives the state\u2019s economy and is home to three quarters of the state\u2019s population. If Democrats are to pull off victories, they have to drive up turnout here to compensate for the GOP\u2019s strength in rural communities that dominate the rest of the state. Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, has about 1.3 million registered voters. So far, the numbers present a mixed picture. Early in-person turnout in Las Vegas was light over the weekend, with only about 19,000 voters casting ballots in-person the first two days. But mail balloting, a process favored by Democrats, was stronger, with about 41,500 votes cast. About 20,000 of those votes were from registered Democrats, compared with about 10,600 from Republicans. The remaining were cast by nonaffiliated or third-party voters. The governor\u2019s mansion andthe seat held by Cortez Masto, the first Latina in the U.S. Senate, are considered two of the Republican Party\u2019s best chances to flip statewide offices around the country. Her opponent is RepublicanAdam Laxalt, whose name is well-known as a former attorney general and grandson of former Sen. Paul Laxalt of Nevada. The winners could be determined by the unique social and economic circumstances in Las Vegas. Rising costs that are being felt globally are packing a double punch here. The city\u2019s heavily working-class population is pinched by higher prices for groceries, and gasoline remains above $5 a gallon. As well, higher costs around the U.S. and the world mean tourists may spend less when they visit, if they even do. Republican Jeffrey Burns, a property manager and chef in Las Vegas, said he voted \u201cRepublican all the way\u201d because everything that the Democrats in control are doing \u201cis just so completely backwards.\u201d He said he wants Laxalt to be a conservative Republican in the Senate and stop approving \u201cthe spending of tons and tons of money like Masto does.\u201d Burns said he wants the U.S. to be energy independent and sees high gas prices as a clear sign of problems but supply chain shortages are still noticeable. \u201cLike, I go to get eggs,\u201d Burns said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s just no eggs. And it\u2019s like, why are there no eggs? That\u2019s just weird.\u201d George Trachtman, a Democrat and lawyer who lives in the town of Enterprise, said he voted for Cortez Masto and Sisolak. Trachtman said economic conditions are not as bad as they\u2019re being portrayed. \u201cIf I go to the Strip, I see tons of people there just having fun and enjoying themselves,\u201d he said. He added that he went to a shopping mall the day before and couldn\u2019t find a parking space because it was so packed. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like a recession or that we\u2019re headed in that direction,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I understand interest rates are going up so things are going to slow down. But right now, things seem like they\u2019re better than what\u2019s being reported.\u201d Perhaps no state was hit harder economically by the pandemic than tourist-dependent Nevada, where casinos were shuttered for two and a half months and unemployment at one point topped 28% \u2014 the worst in the country and the worst in any state since the Great Depression. More than two years later, unemployment is much lower at 4.4%. But that\u2019s the third-worst in the U.S., better only than Illinois and the District of Columbia. Casino winnings, a key economic indicator, are up significantly, as are visitor levels and convention attendance, but those have not returned to pre-pandemic levels. Three casinos that never reopened are being razed, and about 10% of the Culinary Union\u2019s 60,000 members are still out of jobs. The union\u2019s members transform every two years into a political force here, calling voters and knocking doors on behalf of Democratic candidates, especially in the city\u2019s multilingual and working-class neighborhoods. Their union hall has become a must-stop for Democrats, especially once ballots start being cast. \u201cI know what this fight is about,\u201d Cortez Masto told the crowd. \u201cIt\u2019s about good-paying jobs. It\u2019s about affordable health care. It\u2019s about assuring we can retire with dignity.\u201d \u201cThey backed us up when we needed them,\u201d Pappageorge said of the Democratic candidates flanking him. After his remarks were translated into Spanish, he added: \u201cWe\u2019re going to back them up now.\u201d Across the city, Republicans were decidedly upbeat as they predicted a \u201cred wave\u201d was coming to Nevada. The GOP\u2019s nominees rolled up to a palm tree-dotted shopping center in a large bus bearing the name \u201cLaxalt\u201d and climbed out as the song \u201cOnly in America\u201d from country duo Brooks & Dunn played and the crowd of about 100 people clapped and cheered. Though several in the crowd wore \u201cTrump\u201d hats, no one mentioned the name of the former president. Laxalt mocked Cortez Masto for not holding campaign appearances with President Joe Biden and said the state \u201ccannot afford one more week of the Joe Biden-Catherine Cortez Masto economy.\u201d \u201cPeople are as upset as they\u2019ve ever been with what\u2019s happening to America,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have one opportunity here in the midst of a red wave for a transformation election, to transform our state, to take back our country.

    "More questioning sought of Trump aide in Mar-a-Lago probe": [
        "By ERIC TUCKEROctober 25, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Justice Department is seeking to again question an associate of Donald Trump who was seen on security camera footage moving boxes of classified records at the former president\u2019s Florida estate, according to a person familiar with the matter. Walt Nauta has already been interviewed by investigators examining the potential mishandling of classified government records at Mar-a-Lago and prosecutors want to speak with him again as they try to understand howboxes came to be relocated from a storage roomat the property, said the person, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing probe. The Justice Department declined to comment. The department is investigating potential violations of multiple criminal statutes, including unlawful retention of national defense information and obstruction. It is not clear whether anyone will be charged. The obstruction aspect of the probe burst into public view in August when prosecutors in a court filing described how classified documents were \u201clikely concealed and removed\u201d from a Mar-a-Lago storage room in a potential effort to obstruct the investigation and impede Justice Department efforts to recover the records. The Justice Department in May issued a subpoena seeking the return of classified records taken from the White House to Mar-a-Lago after Trump\u2019s term had ended. Law enforcement officials visited on June 3 to collect the records, and were given an envelope containing 38 documents with classification markings. They alsoinstructed the Trump legal teamto preserve the boxes of classified records in the storage room until further notice. But FBI agents came to believe that more documents remained at the home, and that there had been efforts to obstruct their probe. They returned on Aug. 8 with a court-authorized search warrant and collected more than 100 documents marked as classified, including at the top-secret level. The person who spoke to the AP declined to characterize Nauta\u2019s precise account to the authorities. The Washington Post reported earlier this month that a Trump associate, since identified as Nauta, told the FBI that he had moved boxes at Trump\u2019s explicit direction. The New York Times, which reported earlier Monday that prosecutors were seeking another interview with Nauta, also cited one person briefed on the matter as saying that Nauta said he had acted at Trump\u2019s direction. But the newspaper cited another person who described Nauta as less specific about what he had been told. _____ Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP",

    "New US prisons chief pledges truth, reform for ailing system": [
        "By MICHAEL R. SISAK and MICHAEL BALSAMOOctober 25, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The outsider brought in to reform the ailing federal Bureau of Prisons pledged Monday to hold accountable any employees who sexually assault inmates, reform archaic hiring practices and bring new transparency to an agency that has long been a haven of secrecy and coverups. Colette Peters detailed her vision in a wide-ranging interview with The Associated Press, her firstsince becoming director nearly three months ago. She said she wants to reorient the agency\u2019s recruiting and hiring practices to find candidates who want to \u201cchange hearts and minds\u201d and end systemic abuse and corruption. She would not rule out closing problematic prisons, though there are no current plans to do so. As Oregon\u2019s prison director, Peters developed the \u201cOregon Way\u201d of running prisons, which aims to transform \u201cenvironments inside correctional facilities to be more normal and humane,\u201d according to the state prisons\u2019 website. She oversaw sharp drops in Oregon\u2019s inmate population. Skeptics within the federal prison system\u2019s rank and file have derided her approach as \u201chug a thug.\u201d Peters didn\u2019t mind that but offered a different term: \u201cchocolate hearts.\u201d Peters said her ideal prison worker is as interested in preparing inmates for returning to society after their sentences as they are in keeping order while those inmates are still locked within the prison walls. \u201cOur job, as you\u2019ve heard me say before, is not to make good inmates. It\u2019s to make good neighbors,\u201d Peters said. \u201cThey\u2019re coming back to our communities, and so we need to hire the right people on the front end with that kind of thinking to help us do that.\u201d It\u2019s a departure from the agency\u2019s previous recruiting model that stressed the law enforcement aspects of the job. Peters\u2019 approach is similar to how prisons are run in Norway, where the focus behind bars is more on rehabilitation and promoting a humane approach. But Peters acknowledges major hurdles to reforming the Justice Department\u2019s largest agency, a behemoth of more than 30,000 employees, 158,000 inmates and an annual budget of about $8 billion. Peters has visited three federal prisons so far as director. Two have been sources of the agency\u2019s biggest controversies: a federal women\u2019s prison in Dublin, California, where the warden and several other employeeshave been charged with sexually abusing inmates, and the federal prison in Sheridan, Oregon, where inmates say they weredenied showers during a hunger strikeand roughed up by a special tactical team. On Tuesday she\u2019s scheduled to visit U.S. Penitentiary Atlanta with one of the agency\u2019s most vocal critics in Congress, Sen. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga. Ossoff\u2019s committee has been investigating the agency andclashed with her predecessor, Michael Carvajal. Peters in the interview pointedly acknowledged the agency is facing a massive staffing crisis that is at the center of its myriad issues, which Carvajal had refused to do. Low staffing has hampered responses to emergencies and slowed the implementation of the First Step Act, a criminal justice overhaul championed by Democrats and Republicans in Congress. \u201cWe are looking for people who want to change hearts and minds, who want to make good neighbors and safety and security is a top priority,\u201d Peters said. \u201cAnd so that is a paradigm shift, and I hope it\u2019s one that recruits the right people.\u201d Peters said the staffing crisis, exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, has only worsened as the agency looks for new ways to recruit officers and retain its staff. A 2021 AP investigationfound nearly one-third of federal correctional officer positions were vacant, forcing prisons to use cooks, teachers, nurses and other workers to guard inmates. Now, the Bureau of Prisons finds itself not only competing with other law enforcement agencies and corporate employers, but with fast food restaurants offering signing bonuses. In some cities, the biggest hurdle has been huge cost of living burdens. And in rural communities, the agency has struggled to find many qualified applicants. Peters also vowed to have zero tolerance for any employee who abuses their position or sexually abuses inmates in their care. \u201cWe need to continue to hold people accountable, let people see and understand that if you engage in this type of egregious activity, you\u2019re going to prison,\u201d she said. A year ago, the Justice Department took the bold step of closing one of its more troubled facilities:the crumbling Manhattan jail where financier Jeffrey Epstein killed himselfin 2019. Peters says the agency has yet to determine if the jail, the Metropolitan Correctional Center, will reopen \u2014 a task that would require a pricey structural overhaul. She also isn\u2019t ruling out closing more prisons as repair bills pile up and inmate populations shift. \u201cWe will always be analyzing the infrastructure,\u201d Peters said. \u201cWe have billions of dollars in back-loaded infrastructure repairs that need to happen at all of our institutions. At some point there\u2019s a return on investment where there\u2019s just the cost of repairing them are too high.\u201d AP reportinghas revealed rampant sexual abuse and other criminal conduct by staff, dozens of escapes, deaths and severe staffing shortages that have hampered responses to emergencies. \u201cI have said in this room I need to hear the good, the bad and the ugly,\u201d Peters said. \u201cWe cannot have any surprises. We have to know what is happening inside our agency so we can help.\u201d The Bureau of Prisons has also started to \u201cspot check\u201d security cameras at prisons across the U.S. to ensure officers are conducting rounds to check on inmates held in segregated housing units, a major controversy after two officers who were supposed to be guarding Jeffrey Epsteinfalsified documentsclaiming to have checked on him while they werereally sleeping and shopping online. ___ On Twitter, follow Michael Balsamo at twitter.com/mikebalsamo1 and Michael Sisak at twitter.com/mikesisak and send confidential tips by visiting https://www.ap.org/tips.",

    "Arizona sheriff steps up security around ballot drop boxes": [
        "By JONATHAN J. COOPEROctober 25, 2022 GMT",
        " PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 The sheriff in metropolitan Phoenix said Monday he\u2019s stepped up security aroundballot drop boxesafter a series of incidents involving people keeping watch on the boxes and taking video of voters after they were apparently inspired bylies about the 2020 election. On Friday, deputies responded when two masked people carrying guns and wearing bulletproof vests showed up at a drop box in Mesa, a Phoenix suburb. The secretary of state said her office has received six cases of potential voter intimidation to the state attorney general and the U.S. Department of Justice, as well as a threatening email sent to the state elections director. People watching the boxes and voters showing up to vote have covered their license plates, according to photos shared on social media. \u201cEvery day I\u2019m dedicating a considerable amount of resources just to give people confidence that they can cast a vote safely, and that is absurd,\u201d Maricopa County Sheriff Paul Penzone said during a news conference. Penzone said his office has referred two incidents to county prosecutors for potential criminal charges. Fueled by former President Donald Trump\u2019s false claims of fraud in 2020 andthe debunked film\u201c2,000 Mules,\u201ddrop boxeshave becomea hotbed for conspiracy theoriesalleging without evidence that people illegally collected and deposited ballots in them. Election security experts and Trump\u2019s own national security and Justice Department officials said there wasno fraud sufficient to alter the outcome of the 2020 election. Dozens of lawsuits filed after the election were rejected, many by Trump-appointed judges. Arizona, the state with the smallest margin of victory for President Joe Biden two years ago, now has some of the highest-profile midterm races in the country, including a Senate race that could tip the balance of power in Congress. \u201cUninformed vigilantes outside Maricopa County\u2019s drop boxes are not increasing election integrity,\u201d Stephen Richer, the Maricopa County recorder, and Bill Gates, chairman of the county board of supervisors, said in a joint statement over the weekend. \u201cInstead they are leading to voter intimidation complaints.\u201d Richer and Gates are both Republicans. Voters who filed with Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs allege they were filmed and in some cases followed by people keeping watch on drop boxes. \u201cAs we were getting up to our car, two individuals took pictures of our license plate and our car,\u201d one voter wrote. \u201cI got out and asked what they were doing. They claimed they were taking pictures for \u2018election security\u2019 and I took pictures of them to report them to the DOJ for voter intimation and harassments.\u201d Asked at an unrelated event Monday whether he was concerned about reported intimidation in states like Arizona, and if the Justice Department would get involved, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said the department has an obligation to \u201cguarantee a free, fair vote by everyone who is qualified to vote, and will not permit voters to be intimidated.\u201d A group of drop box watchers seen filming a drop box in Maricopa County last week told a local reporter they were with Clean Elections USA, a group that is gathering teams to watch drop boxes in several states this midterm season. The group\u2019s founder, Melody Jennings, said in a podcast interview last month that she wants 10 volunteers videotaping drop boxes nationwide, in shifts, day and night. Jennings said that she wants volunteers to keep their distance from drop boxes and abide by local laws. But she added that they should sit in a visible place to act as a \u201chuman shield\u201d that deters potential ballot \u201cmules\u201d from coming to drop boxes. There\u2019s no evidence for the notion that a network of Democrat-associated ballot \u201cmules\u201d has conspired to collect and deliver ballots to drop boxes, despite claims made in a film about the 2020 election. Two left-leaning advocacy groups filed a lawsuit Monday against Clean Elections USA alleging the group\u2019s ballot watching activities violate the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871. The Arizona Alliance for Retired Americans and Voto Latino are asking the U.S. District Court in Phoenix to ban the group from gathering within site of drop boxes and filming voters. Arizona state Sen. Kelly Townsend, who earlier this year praised and encouraged \u201call you vigilantes that want to camp out at these drop boxes,\u201d wrote on Twitter Monday that wearing tactical gear while watching drop boxes \u201ccould be considered voter intimidation.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d Townsend wrote. Penzone, the sheriff, implored people to respect everyone\u2019s right to vote and leave it to law enforcement officers to investigate suspected violations of the law. He said the intense focus on securing elections has pulled resources away from investigating crimes. \u201cBut we\u2019ll come and we\u2019ll babysit polling sites because people have to misbehave if that\u2019s what we have to do to protect democracy,\u201d said Penzone, a Democrat. ___ Associated Press writers Eric Tucker in Washington and Ali Swenson in New York contributed to this report.",

    "Jan. 6 trial delayed after Oath Keepers\u2019 leader gets COVID": [
        "By ASHRAF KHALIL and ALANNA DURKIN RICHEROctober 25, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The trial of a far-right extremist group leader and four associates charged in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol was delayed on Monday after the Oath Keepers leader tested positive for the coronavirus. Jurors were supposed to begin hearing the fourth week of testimony in the case against Stewart Rhodes and four othersaccused of plotting to stop the transfer of power from Republican Donald Trump to Democrat Joe Biden. Testimony could resume Tuesday morning if Rhodes waives his right to be present in court for at least some of the remaining government witnesses. The judge said he believes the earliest Rhodes can return to court is next Monday. Prosecutors were initially expected to rest their case by the end of this week and then Rhodes\u2019 attorneys were going to begin putting on their defense. Rhodes\u2019 lawyers have said their client will take the stand totestify that all of his actions were in anticipation of orders he expected from Trump \u2014 orders that never came. The defendants are the first among hundreds charged in the Capitol attack to stand trial on the charge ofseditious conspiracy,a rare Civil War-era charge that carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Prosecutors have said Rhodes and his extremist group planned an \u201carmed rebellion\u201d to keep Trump in power. Authorities say they had \u201cquick reaction force\u201d teams stationed at a Virginia hotel to get weapons into the city quickly if they were needed and that the group was prepared to stop Biden from becoming president by any means necessary. Defense lawyers have accused prosecutors of cherry-picking messages and have said they came to provide security to political figures like Roger Stone, not to carry out a plan to attack the Capitol. Testimony began on Oct. 3and the judge had said witnesses could stretch into the week of Nov. 14. The stakes are high for the Justice Department, which last secured a seditious conspiracy conviction at trial nearly 30 years ago and intends to try two more groups on the charge later this year. The disruption comes almost a week after a juror was dismissed after testing positive for COVID. The federal courthouse in Washington where the trial is being held last week lifted its mask mandate, but the judge overseeing the trial was still requiring those not speaking to wear masks to avoid an outbreak. Still, lawyers and defendants were occasionally seen with noses exposed or masks pulled down under their chin. On trial with Rhodes, of Granbury, Texas, are Kelly Meggs, leader of the Florida chapter of the Oath Keepers; Kenneth Harrelson, another Florida Oath Keeper; Thomas Caldwell, a retired U.S. Navy intelligence officer from Virginia; and Jessica Watkins, who led an Ohio militia group. They face several other charges as well. They are among roughly 900 people who have been charged in the attack, which temporarily halted the certification of Biden\u2019s victory, sent lawmakers running for cover and left dozens of police officers injured. ___ Richer reported from Boston.",

    "Man who stormed Capitol with dad gets 2 years in prison": [
        "October 25, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A Delaware man who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, with his Confederate flag-toting father was sentenced on Monday to two years behind bars. Hunter Seefried, 24,was convicted alongside his fatherof felony and misdemeanor charges by U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden in June. Hunter and Kevin Seefried opted for a bench trial, which is decided by a judge, rather than have their case be heard by a jury. The father and son traveled to Washington from their home in Laurel, Delaware, to hear Trump\u2019s speech at the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally on Jan. 6. They were among the first rioters to approach the building near the Senate Wing Door, according to prosecutors. After watching other rioters use a police shield and a wooden plank to break a window, Hunter Seefried used a gloved fist to clear a large shard of glass in one of the broken windowpanes, prosecutors said. The judge found that two other rioters had destroyed the window before Seefried cleared the piece of glass. Widely published photographs showed Kevin Seefried carrying a Confederate battle flag inside the Capitol after he and Hunter, then 22, entered the building through a broken window. An attorney for Hunter Seefried had asked for probation and home detention instead of prison time. He said in court papers that his client only went to the Capitol that day because his father pushed him to join. And he noted that the son never hurt or threatened anyone at the Capitol. \u201cHunter is a decent, hardworking and caring young man, who was misled and got caught up in the unfortunate events of January 6, 2021,\u201d attorney Edson Bostic said in an email. \u201cHe is very remorseful and wished he could relive and change his behavior that day.\u201d Kevin Seefried is scheduled to be sentenced in January. Both men were convicted of obstruction of an official proceeding, the joint session of Congress for certifying the Electoral College that day. The judge also convicted the Seefrieds of misdemeanor charges that they engaged in disorderly conduct and illegally demonstrated inside the building. But he acquitted Hunter Seefried of other misdemeanor charges. They are among about 900 people who have been charged with federal crimes related to the Jan. 6 attack. More than 420 of them have pleaded guilty, mostly to misdemeanor offenses. Roughly 300 Capitol riot defendants have been sentenced, with sentences ranging from probation to 10 years behind bars.",

    "Nevada elections office seeks clarity on ballot hand count": [
        "By GABE STERNOctober 24, 2022 GMT",
        " RENO, Nev. (AP) \u2014 A rural Nevada county\u2019s plan to hand-count all paper ballots for themidterm electionsis coming under renewed scrutiny just days before the tally is set to begin. The sticking point: How the county will keep the ongoing vote totals from leaking publicly. A ruling Friday from the Nevada Supreme Court allowed the hand count to move forward with several provisions, one of which was to ensure that the vote counting was not live-streamed and to figure out a way to ensure that election workers could keep the tallies secret. Ballots cast early, either in-person or by mail, are typically counted by machine on Election Day, with results released only after polls close. Nye County,where conspiracy theories about voting machineshave run rampant, wants a hand count in addition to the machine tally. The hand-count of mail-in ballots is set to start on Oct. 26, just under two weeks before Election Day to be certified by the state\u2019s deadline. In a letter to interim Nye County Clerk Mark Kampf over the weekend, Nevada Deputy Secretary of State for Elections Mark Wlaschin asked for a \u201cwritten explanation as to how Nye County and you intend to comply with all of the provisions\u201d of the ruling. The Nevada Supreme Court ruled partially in favor of an American Civil Liberties Union lawsuit that challenged several aspects of the hand-count, including a livestream that Kampf said allows individuals to \u201cbecome poll watchers at home.\u201d In Saturday\u2019s letter, Wlaschin said he particularly needed to know how Nye County would ensure that observers do not prematurely learn the running results of any races. Nevada has nationally important races this year for U.S. Senate, governor and secretary of state. Lawyers who represented Nye County responded Monday by saying only that the county \u201cfully intends to comply\u201d with the state Supreme Court\u2019s Friday order. Wlaschin did not immediately respond to a text message Monday afternoon asking if the county\u2019s hand-count will still be permitted. Recordings from the cameras that were originally meant to livestream the hand-count now will not be released until polls close, the county said in its response. As for the public hand-count, the county noted that they will be conducted in four to six different rooms, so viewers will not know the \u201ctotality of returns.\u201d Observers must sign a form saying they will not release any early results they hear. If they do release them, they could be charged with a gross misdemeanor. \u201cUnless we hear from you otherwise, we will assume that Nye County\u2019s procedures for its parallel process as set forth above sufficiently comply with the Order,\u201d Nye County\u2019s counsel said in the Monday letter. Hand-count tallies are done publicly for transparency, with observers in the room. Voting groups have said that raises the possibility that someone could release early results before most voters have even cast their ballot,which they have saidcould cause \u201cmanipulative release\u201d and influence voter turnout. Nye County\u2019s hand-count of mail-in ballots is set to start Wednesday morning. Under Nye County\u2019s plan, hand-count teams of five will include a reader who announces each result, a verifier who looks over the reader\u2019s shoulder and three talliers who write down the results. The talliers then compare their results before submitting them. They count ballots in batches of 50 in a public area. In an email to The Associated Press, Kampf said he had 98 volunteers as of Monday morning. Nye County is one of the first jurisdictions nationwide to act on election conspiracies related to mistrust in voting machines. In June\u2019s primary, Nevada\u2019s least populous county, Esmeralda, took more than seven hours to hand-count the results on 317 ballots cast to certify results. Elsewhere in Nevada, Elko County\u2019s board of commissioners signaled their support for hand-counting and paper ballots last week, although they will likely stick with machines this cycle because Election Day is so soon. Hand-counting is mostly used in small townships across New England and rural Wisconsin. There are 658 jurisdictions in the continental U.S. that rely exclusively on hand-counting, with the vast majority having fewer than 2,000 registered voters, according to data from Verified Voting, a group that tracks voting equipment across states. The most populous county in the continental U.S. to use only hand-counting is Owyhee County, Idaho, which had 6,315 registered voters in 2020. Nye County had over 33,000 registered voters. It also will use machine tabulators for the Nov. 8 election. But the sheer number of ballots to be hand-counted raises questions about whether the county can meet the Nov. 17 deadline to certify results. Kampf was appointed county clerk after the long-time clerk resigned in July, a decision she made after election conspiracies, fueled by those repeating lies about former President Donald Trump\u2019s loss in 2020, spread throughout the county. The board of commissioners voted unanimously to recommend doing away with voting machines and count all ballots by hand. ___ Stern is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Biden has largely steered clear of traditional campaign events around the country, in favor of speeches where he tries to frame the stakes for voters. \u201cThe polls have been all over the place,\u201d Biden said, adding that surveys have become increasingly unreliable for measuring public opinion. \u201cRepublicans ahead, Democrats ahead, Republicans ahead. But it\u2019s going to close, I think, with seeing one more shift \u2014 Democrats ahead.\u201d He said Republicans would roll back progress on expanding health care coverage, limiting the cost of prescription drugs and increasing taxes on corporations. \u201cAt least they\u2019re being honest this time,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re telling you exactly what they want to do if they win.\u201d He added, \u201cThey\u2019re so confident they\u2019re going to win, they\u2019re saying this without an ounce of shame.\u201d He accused them of \u201cmega-MAGA, trickle-down politics in the extreme,\u201d the latest iteration of Biden\u2019s attempts to brand his political opponents.

BligejoinedJill Bidenand the American Cancer Society to announce national meetings on breast and cervical cancer. The cancer society pledged to convene the events after President Joe Biden and the first lady resurrected the\u201ccancer moonshot\u201d initiativethis year. The program provides more money for research to, as Jill Biden said, \u201chelp us end cancer as we know it. For good.\u201d R&B superstar Blige said she lost aunts and other family members to breast, cervical and lung cancer. She has promoted breast cancer screening, especially among Black women who are disproportionately affected, through the Black Women\u2019s Health Imperative. Blige on Monday blamed misconceptions about mammograms among Black women and \u201cthe practice of not wanting other people in our business\u201d for disparities in breast cancer outcomes between Blacks and whites. She said she is convinced that, had her aunts, godmother and grandparents been informed about cancer, \u201cthey would have a different outcome today.\u201d She paused a few times to stay composed. The first lady reached for Blige when the Grammy Award-winning singer returned to her seat. They sat holding hands for several minutes before Biden, whose adult son Beau died of brain cancer in 2015, thanked Blige for \u201clending your powerful voice to this cause.\u201d The first lady said the administration\u2019s cancer initiative will help encourage collaboration and research, invest in new treatments and therapies, and help people get the best care and support for their loved ones. She said it is about creating \u201ca future where we don\u2019t have to be afraid of the word cancer anymore.\u201d The American Cancer Society said the roundtables will bring doctors, scientists and other professionals together with leading organizations to work on making progress against cancer. They are to begin this week, said Karen Knudsen, the CEO. Breast cancer is the leading cancer for women, and is the No. 1 cause of death among Black and Latino women. More than 14,000 women will be diagnosed with cervical cancer this year, resulting in more than 4,000 deaths, she said. Knudsen said the meetings will work to \u201cend breast and cervical cancer as we know it for everyone.\u201d Since becoming first lady, Jill Biden has traveled around the country to learn about advances in cancer research and encourage people, especially women, to catch up on the screenings they skipped during the pandemic.

    "Early votes in Georgia, nation could signal high \u201922 turnout": [
        "By BILL BARROW and JEFF AMYOctober 24, 2022 GMT",
        " ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Early voting is going gangbusters in Georgia in theopening days of midterm balloting, fueling a new round of partisan jousting over Republicans\u2019 overhaul of election procedures after Democrats\u2019 2020 victories in the state. Through Sunday, about 838,000 Georgians had cast their ballots, most of them in person at advance voting sites, the rest returning mail ballots. That\u2019s almost 60% higher than advance voting totals at this point in 2018, the last midterm election. More than 10% of Georgia\u2019s registered voters have already cast votes, a share that trails only Massachusetts and Vermont, where 22% and 16% of voters have sent in ballots, according to an Associated Press analysis ofdata collected by University of Florida professor Michael McDonald. California and Florida have each accepted more than 1 million mail ballots thus far. And the numbers nationwide are likely to accelerate this week as more states open early in-person polling places or send ballots to voters. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing very robust numbers of people who are voting early, so at this point we\u2019d have to see turnout crater before election day for the trajectory we\u2019re on to change,\u201d McDonald said. Republicans have seized on the Georgia numbers as vindication fortheir 2021 rewrite of state election law. They\u2019re hoping to re-elect Gov. Brian Kemp, who narrowly prevailed over Democrat Stacey Abrams in 2018, and boost Herschel Walker overRaphael Warnock, the Democrat who won a Senate runoff in January 2021. The turnout is record-setting, said Tate Mitchell, a spokesperson for the Kemp campaign, \u201cwhile Stacey Abrams continues to spread the myth of voter suppression.\u201d Abrams pushes back against that taunt, even as she, too, celebrates the high early turnout. \u201cMore people in the water does not mean there are fewer sharks,\u201d Abrams said Monday. \u201cIt is wrong to suggest that there is a correlation between voter turnout and voter suppression because suppression is about barriers,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cIf those barriers are not completely successful, the credit does not go to those who erected the barriers. The credit goes to those voters who found a way to navigate, overwhelm and overcome those barriers.\u201d The spike in early voter turnout does coincide with Abrams encouraging her supporters to vote in person and not use mail ballots. She promoted the mail-ins heavily in her loss to Kemp four years ago \u2014 as did Democrats elsewhere to their advantage during the pandemic election of 2020. However, Georgia\u2019s 2021 voting law added identification requirements to the mail voting process and severely curtailed the number of drop boxes used during the 2020 cycle in urban counties, which tilt heavily to Democrats. The law also made iteasier for anyone to challenge an individual voter\u2019s eligibilityand reduced opportunities to cast a provisional ballot if a voter shows up in the wrong polling place on Election Day. The Abrams campaign says more than 90,000 voters have had their eligibility challenged, mostly by conservative groups, although a large share of those challenges have been dismissed. Kemp defeated Abrams by about 55,000 votes four years ago. President Joe Biden won Georgia\u2019s electoral votes by about 11,500 votes in 2020, and Warnock won his Senate runoff by about 95,000. Given the election law changes, Democrats are pushing supporters to vote as soon as possible during the early in-person voting window, which began Oct. 17 and continues through Nov. 4, four days before Election Day. The idea is that if committed Democrats vote early, the party will be able to shift its focus to others, plus reduce crowding in the last week of early voting. Lauren Groh-Wargo, Abrams\u2019 campaign manager, said Monday that \u201cthis big turnout in week one has been a key part of our strategy,\u201d and the campaign doesn\u2019t believe voting will drop off. Abrams\u2019 strategy, from the outset of her first run for governor four years ago, has been to expand the electorate by coaxing sporadic voters, especially among younger generations and nonwhites of all ages. She is Black, Kemp is white. Groh-Wargo said 16% of advance voters so far, including mail and in-person, did not vote in Georgia in 2018, according to the campaign\u2019s analysis. Further, she said about 55,000 of the earlies did not vote in 2020, when Democrats won. Those trends, she said, suggest the strategy is working, at least in the opening days of early voting. But Kemp has led in almost all public polls, and his campaign continues to try to reach beyond Republican partisans to win independents and some Black voters. \u201cWe feel confident that Gov. Kemp\u2019s record of success and vision of the future will continue to win voters from all across the Peach State,\u201d Mitchell said. The Abrams campaign touted high Black turnout thus far, with about 35.5% of the advance ballots coming from Black voters. In 2020, when Biden won, that was 33% through one week of advance voting. In 2018, when Abrams lost, it was 31%. Groh-Wargo highlighted Black men, as well, saying the campaign\u2019s analysis shows that about 97,000 Black men have voted already; that was about 45,000 at this point during Abrams\u2019 losing effort. Abrams, who would be the first female Black governor in the United States,has more openly concentrated on reaching Black menin her second campaign. The Georgia electorate does not yet reflect a surge in turnout among women, even as Democrats insist that the Supreme Court decision to overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortionwill sway women nationally.Data show that the advance vote thus far is 54.5% female, which is about average in Georgia general elections. It is notable, however, that mail ballot requesters are 59% female, and most of those have yet to be returned. So the electorate could still end up being more female than usual. \u2014- Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the elections at:https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections Check outhttps://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-electionsto learn more about the issues and factors at play in the 2022 midterm elections.",

    "Test scores show historic COVID setbacks for kids across US": [
        "By COLLIN BINKLEYOctober 24, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The COVID-19 pandemic caused historic learning setbacks for America\u2019s children, sparing no state or region as it erased decades of academic progress and widened racial disparities, according to results of a national test that provide the sharpest look yet at the scale of the crisis. Across the country, math scores saw their largest decreases ever. Reading scores dropped to 1992 levels. Nearly four in 10 eighth graders failed to grasp basic math concepts. Not a single state saw a notable improvement in their average test scores, with some simply treading water at best. Those are the findings from the National Assessment of Educational Progress \u2014 known as the \u201cnation\u2019s report card\u201d \u2014 which tested hundreds of thousands of fourth and eighth graders across the country this year. It was the first time the test had been given since 2019, and it\u2019s seen as the first nationally representative study of the pandemic\u2019s impact on learning. \u201cIt is a serious wakeup call for us all,\u201d Peggy Carr, commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics, a branch of the Education Department, said in an interview. \u201cIn NAEP, when we experience a 1- or 2-point decline, we\u2019re talking about it as a significant impact on a student\u2019s achievement. In math, we experienced an 8-point decline \u2014 historic for this assessment.\u201d Researchers usually think of a 10-point gain or drop as equivalent to roughly a year of learning. It\u2019s no surprise that children are behind. The pandemic upended everyday life andleft millions learning from homefor months or more. The results released Monday reveal the depth of those setbacks and the size of the challenge schools face as they help students catch up. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said it\u2019s a sign that schools need to redouble their efforts, usingbillions of dollars that Congress gave schools to help students recover. \u201cLet me be very clear: These results are not acceptable,\u201d Cardona said. The NAEP test is typically given every two years. It was taken between January and March by a sample of students in every state, along with 26 of the nation\u2019s largest school districts. Scoreshad been stalling even before the pandemic, but the new results show decreases on a scale not seen before. In both math and reading, students scored lower than those tested in 2019. But while reading scores dipped, math scores plummeted by the largest margins in the history of the NAEP program, which began in 1969. Math scores were worst among eighth graders, with 38% earning scores deemed \u201cbelow basic\u201d \u2014 a cutoff that measures, for example, whether students can find the third angle of a triangle if they\u2019re given the other two. That\u2019s worse than 2019, when 31% of eighth graders scored below that level. No part of the country was exempt. Every region saw test scores slide, and every state saw declines in at least one subject. Several major districts saw test scores fall by more than 10 points. Cleveland saw the largest single drop, falling 16 points in fourth-grade reading, along with a 15-point decline in fourth-grade math. Baltimore and Tennessee\u2019s Shelby County also saw precipitous declines. \u201cThis is more confirmation that the pandemic hit us really hard,\u201d said Eric Gordon, chief executive for the Cleveland Metropolitan School District. To help students recover, the school system has beefed up summer school and added after-school tutoring. \u201cI\u2019m not concerned that they can\u2019t or won\u2019t recover,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that the country won\u2019t stay focused on getting kids caught up.\u201d The results show a reversal of progress on math scores, which had made big gains since the 1990s. Reading, by contrast, had changed little in recent decades, so even this year\u2019s relatively small decreases put the averages back to where they were in 1992. Most concerning, however, are the gaps between students. Confirming what many had feared, racial inequities appear to have widened. In fourth grade, Black and Hispanic students saw bigger decreases than white students, widening gaps that have persisted for decades. Inequities were also reflected in a growing gap between higher and lower performing students. In math and reading, scores fell most sharply among the lowest performing students, creating a widening chasm between struggling students and the rest of their peers. Surveys done as part of this year\u2019s test illustrate the divide. When schools shifted to remote learning, higher performing students were far more likely to have reliable access to quiet spaces, computers and help from their teachers, the survey found. The results make clear that schools must address the \u201clong-standing and systemic shortcomings of our education system,\u201d said Alberto Carvalho, superintendent of Los Angeles schools and a member of the National Assessment Governing Board, which sets the policies for the test. Many parents may not understand just how far behind their children are academically. A spring survey by the national nonprofit Learning Heroes found the majority of parents believed their children were performing at or above their grade level in math and reading. \u201cThere\u2019s a myth that parents just don\u2019t want to know. That the country just wants to get back to normal,\u201d said Sonja Santelises, chief executive officer of Baltimore City Public Schools. \u201cBut parents are very concerned.\u201d Some parents blame schools for not clearly communicating learning gaps. In Nashville, a parent advocacy group is pushing the school system to share clearer information about student progress \u2014 and to create personal plans to help students catch up. \u201cEvery student has the right to be taught to read, but we failed at that,\u201d said Sonya Thomas, a mother who is the executive director of Nashville PROPEL. \u201cThat\u2019s creating social emotional problems. That\u2019s creating workforce problems. That\u2019s creating life and death problems.\u201d Other recent studies have found that students who spent longer periods learning online suffered greater setbacks. But the NAEP results show no clear connection. Areas that returned to the classroom quickly still saw significant declines, and cities \u2014 which were more likely to stay remote longer \u2014 actually saw milder decreases than suburban districts. Los Angeles can claim one of few bright spots. The nation\u2019s second-largest school district saw eighth-grade reading scores increase by 9 points, the only significant uptick in any district. For other districts, it was a feat just to hold even, as achieved by Dallas and Florida\u2019s Hillsborough County. Testing critics caution against putting too much stock in standardized exams, but there\u2019s no doubt that the skills it aims to measure are critical. Students who take longer to master reading are more likely to drop out and end up in the criminal justice system, research has found, and eighth grade is seen as a pivotal time to develop skills for math and science careers. For Carr, the results raise new questions about what will happen to students who appear to be far behind in attaining those skills. \u201cWewant our students to be preparedglobally for STEM careers, science and technology and engineering,\u201d she said. \u201cThis puts all of that at risk. We have to do a reset. This is a very serious issue, and it\u2019s not going to go away on its own.\u201d ___ AP education writer Bianca V\u00e1zquez Toness in Boston contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press education team receives support from the Carnegie Corporation of New York.

    "On witness stand, Trump ally denies foreign influence charge": [
        "By TOM HAYSOctober 24, 2022 GMT",
        " NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A California billionaire known as an ally of Donald Trump used his testimony at hisfederal trialon Monday to question Trump\u2019s leadership on foreign policy, saying the former president was clueless about the dynamics in the Middle East. The defendant, Tom Barrack, is accused of using his \u201cunique access\u201d as a longtime friend of Trump to provide confidential information about the Trump administration to the United Arab Emirates to advance the UAE\u2019s foreign policy and business interests. Prosecutors say that while UAE officials were consorting with Barrack, they were rewarding him by pouring millions of dollars into his business ventures. Barrack, the onetime chair of Trump\u2019s inaugural committee, told a New York City jury that he considered Trump to be a \u201cbold\u201d and \u201csmart\u201d businessman, and had backed his candidacy as a political outsider who \u201ccould be a good thing for the system.\u201d However, he testified that he later grew disillusioned because of Trump\u2019s anti-Muslim rhetoric and other divisive positions he called \u201cdisastrous.\u201d He testified that some of his clients in his private equity firm \u201cwere upset I was friends with the president.\u201d Trump, he added, was perceived as someone who \u201ccould not spell \u2018Middle East.\u2019 \u2026 It was a nightmare.\u201d Barrack said he made it a mission to sell Trump on encouraging the UAE and Saudi Arabia to align with Israel as a way to bring stability to the oil-rich region. He also worked behind the scenes to try to get the former president to drop the idea of a Muslim travel ban. He said he took the position, \u201cThis is America. How can you ban a whole religion?\u201d Barrack also testified that it would have been \u201cimpossible\u201d for him to act as a foreign agent for one Middle East investor in his firm because other investors would object to it. Barrack said there\u2019s an intense vetting process to assure that money managers don\u2019t have such conflicts of interest. Investors \u201cwant to know that nobody has an edge, that they\u2019re all equal,\u201d he said. Otherwise, \u201cIt would chill every other investor,\u201d he added. Barrack, 75, has pleaded not guilty to acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government, obstruction of justice and making false statements. His lawyers have denied he did anything underhanded. The Los Angeles-based billionaire has known Trump going back decades, since their days developing real estate. Barrack played an integral role in the 2016 campaign as a top fundraiser at a time when many other Republicans were shunning the upstart candidate. The government rested its criminal case last week.Much of the evidencefocused on emails and other back-channel communications between Barrack and his high-level leaders in the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Prosecutors say those communications show how Barrack and his contacts strategized over how to win over Trump. The defendant suggested on Monday that there was nothing nefarious about his constant contact with UAE leaders while Trump was taking office. The interactions would have been a normal part of doing business with any country or government partnering with him in high-end real estate deals using state-owned investment funds, he said. The explanation came after Barrack described his rise to a high-finance heavyweight from humble beginnings in Southern California as the son of a small grocery store owner of Lebanese descent. With his background, the Arabic speaker said he developed a cultural \u201csixth sense\u201d for building relationships with Arab world clients. Before being indicted, Barrack drew attention by raising $107 million for the former president\u2019s inaugural celebration following the 2016 election. The event was scrutinized both for its lavish spending and for attracting foreign officials and businesspeople looking to lobby the new administration. Barrack is to continue testifying on Tuesday.",

    "2 conservatives accused in hoax robocall scheme plead guilty": [
        "By MARK GILLISPIEOctober 24, 2022 GMT",
        " CLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 Two right-wing operatives pleaded guilty on Monday in Cleveland to single felony counts of telecommunications fraud for having placed thousands of false robocalls in Ohio that told people they could be arrested or be forced to receive vaccinations based on information they submitted in votes by mail. Jacob Wohl, 24, of Irvine, California, and Jack Burkman, 56, of Arlington, Virginia, could each receive a year in prison when they are sentenced Nov. 29 in common pleas court. They were indicted in October 2020 on numerous counts of telecommunications fraud and bribery. Wohl\u2019s attorney, Mark Wieczorek, declined to comment about the his client\u2019s plea. Burkman\u2019s attorney, Brian Joslyn, did not immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment. The two men were accused of arranging for a voice broadcast service to make about 85,000 robocalls to predominantly Black neighborhoods in Ohio, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania and Illinois during the runup to the 2020 general election. Prosecutors said the pair were responsible for 3,500 calls to residents of Cleveland and East Cleveland. Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Michael O\u2019Malley at the time the pair were charged said they \u201cclearly infringed upon that right in a blatant attempt to suppress votes and undermine the integrity of this election.\u201d Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, whose consumer protection unit assisted in the investigation, issued a statement Monday saying \u201cvoter intimidation won\u2019t be tolerated in Ohio.\u201d The calls warned people that information included in their mailed ballots could be used by law enforcement agencies to enforce arrest warrants, to collect outstanding debts, and lead to tracking by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for mandatory vaccines. Wohl and Burkman have a history of staging hoaxes and spreading false smears against Democrats and public officials. The Associated Press reported in May 2019 that a 21-year-old college student from Michigan said the men recruited him to falsely claim he was raped by then-Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, and published the smear without the student\u2019s permission. Wohl denied the accusation, saying the student had reached out to him. Burkman said on Twitter that he believed the student\u2019s initial account of the alleged assault was \u201caccurate and true.\u201d The men have beensued in federal courtin New York City and facea $5.1 million fine leviedby the Federal Communications Commission. Wohl and Burkman are appealingcriminal charges filed against themin Detroit stemming from a similar bogus robocall scheme targeting Black voters.",

    "Meet Dale Haney, the White House groundskeeper for 50 years": [
        "By DARLENE SUPERVILLEOctober 24, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Presidents come and go, but one constant through 10 presidencies has beenDale Haney,the chief White House groundskeeper, who as of this month has spent 50 years serving the families \u2014 and many of their pets \u2014 who have called the mansion home. Haney\u2019s chief responsibility is to care for the vast lawns, colorful flower gardens, hundreds of trees, thousands of shrubs and burgeoning vegetable garden on 18 acres of property surrounding the White House. He also picks out the official White House Christmas tree every year \u2014 and already chose this year\u2019s fir from a Pennsylvania farm. To honor Haney, Biden and his wife, Jill, surprised Haney on Monday by planting an elm tree on the south grounds. Biden said visitors in future years are \u201cgoing to be looking at this tree and asking, \u2019Who\u2019s Dale?\u201d Haney joked that he \u201cmight still be here.\u201d But Haney is perhaps better known to many at the White House, from staff to Secret Service officers, as the keeper of the president\u2019s pets. \u201cHe\u2019s like the whisperer,\u201d said Anita McBride, who was a young aide in the correspondence office in Ronald Reagan\u2019s administration when she first met Haney. These days, Haney is often seen walking Commander,President Joe Biden\u2019s German shepherd. \u201cThe first thing that I think about when I think about Dale is his relationship with the first family\u2019s animals,\u201d said Gary Walters, who had a lengthy employment record of his own serving four presidents over 20 years as White House chief usher, managing the residence staff. Walters recalled the chaos of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 and the evacuation of the White House while President George W. Bush was in Florida. Walters and some of his staff had stayed behind despite the evacuation. They were on the South Lawn when Walters turned around \u201cand there was Dale standing with Barney under one arm and Kitty Cat under the other.\u201d \u201cHe had to find them and was looking for direction on what to do with them,\u201d Walters said of Bush\u2019s Scottish terrier and cat. The pets eventually were reunited with Laura Bush at a remote location. A TWO-YEAR PLAN Anyone starting a career these days is unlikely to still have that job a half century later, but Haney\u2019s long employment record fits right in at the White House. He\u2019s a member of the operations staff \u2014 the scores of housekeepers, butlers, electricians, carpenters, gardeners and others \u2014 who aren\u2019t involved in the policy or politics. Their job is to keep the place running and take care of the families. Many hold their jobs for decades. \u201cIt\u2019s a unique role within the White House,\u201d said McBride, who encountered Haney again when she returned to work for Presidents George H.W. Bush and later, for his son. Haney had planned to work just two years at the White House when he started in 1972, during Richard Nixon\u2019s presidency. He had a bachelor\u2019s degree in horticulture and wanted to go back to school to continue his studies. He was interning in the gardens at the Dumbarton Oaks museum in Washington when the White House called over looking for someone who could help with its grounds care. He interviewed and started work six months later as a gardener with the National Park Service, which cares for the White House grounds. Haney became foreman, thenchief horticulturalist,before he was promoted to grounds superintendent in 2008, a position that made him part of the White House residence staff. Haney reports to the chief usher, and supervises a full-time staff of 12 gardeners, maintenance workers, electricians and plumbers. \u201cWhen I accepted the job I agreed to stay for two years,\u201d he said in an interview with White House History Quarterly, a publication of the White House Historical Association. \u201cBut the time has gone by so fast that it really doesn\u2019t feel like 50 years.\u201d He and his team are so busy that \u201cit has been easy to forget that time is passing. No day is ever the same and every day brings challenges.\u201d EYEWITNESS TO HISTORY Haney, who turns 71 on Nov. 4, has seen gobs of White House history unfold: Nixon departing the White House by helicopter after he resigned in 1974. President Jimmy Carter overseeing the signing of a landmark peace treaty between Egypt and Israel in 1979. The crash of a small plane on the grounds in 1994. The evacuation on 9/11. President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cbeer summit\u201d in 2009. President Donald Trumphosting portions of the Republican Party\u2019s national political conventionon the South Lawn in 2020. Fifty years ofannual Easter Egg Rollsand numerous state arrival ceremonies for world leaders, including three visits by Queen Elizabeth II andthree different popes. Another state arrival is in the works forFrance\u2019s president on Dec. 1. TheSouth Lawn will become a wedding venueon Nov. 19 for Biden\u2019s granddaughter Naomi. WORKING WITH THE EAST WING First families typically find ways to leave a lasting imprint on the White House and sometimes that involves the grounds. Most recently, Haney helpedMelania Trumpadd atennis pavilionto the south grounds andrenovate the Rose Garden. \u201cHis meticulous attention to detail always ensures and preserves the beauty of the White House grounds for many to enjoy,\u201d the former first lady said in a statement to The Associated Press. Haney also helpedMichelle Obamacreate her 1,100-square-foot \u201ckitchen garden,\u201d which continues to sprout an assortment of vegetables, fruit and herbs. A beehive produces honey. Laura Bushremembered Haney as \u201cthe best friend to all the animals.\u201d \u201cOur dogs Spot, Barney and Beazley adored him,\u201d she said in a statement to AP. \u201cThey loved him more than they loved us.\u201d Jill Bidenannounced Haney\u2019s public service milestone bytweeting a photo of himwith her, the president and Commander in the Oval Office. Obama and his wife, Michelle, sent Haney a letter thanking him for bringing his \u201cpassion\u201d and \u201cexpertise to the immensely difficult task of caring for the White House grounds.\u201d They added: \u201cWe will also never forget how wonderfully you cared forSunny and Bo,\u201d the family\u2019s dogs. \u201cIndeed, you have made and lived history,\u201d Bill and Hillary Clinton and daughter Chelsea said in their own note to Haney, also shared with AP. GUIDING STAR Haney was one of the first people Debra Dunn met after she was put in charge of the White House visitor\u2019s office after the elder Bush took office in 1989. Easter came early that year, she said, and only one member of her small staff had experience planning events for 30,000 people. But Haney talked her through some of the logistics, she said, and introduced her to other staffers who could help, like carpenters and florists. For Halloween, Dunn recalled fretting about a setting and props. Haney told her about an enormous pumpkin from a past celebration that was sitting in a warehouse. \u201cHow would I have known that existed?\u201d she asked in a telephone interview from Paris, where she lives and works. \u201cHe was just my guiding star.\u201d McBride said that\u2019s why people love Haney. \u201cAnybody that\u2019s worked in the White House has encountered him, whether it\u2019s once or a hundred times,\u201d she said. \u201cThe mere mention of his name just brings a smile to your face because he\u2019s so joyful about his job and friendly to everyone.\u201d",

    "One hug and one selfie at a time, Biden\u2019s mission to connect": [
        "By ZEKE MILLEROctober 24, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 One handshake, one hug and one selfie at a time. IfPresident Joe Bidencould greet every American this way, longtime allies say, his approval ratings would soar. Biden has never been at his best in big speeches, where his delivery can be stilted, his stories sometimes meandering. It\u2019s the end of his speech that often marks the beginning of Biden\u2019s favorite part of an event \u2014 the rope line, in the parlance of political operatives. He whirls around, scans the crowd and zeroes in on his first target for a one-on-one connection. It might be with someone like Tim Eichinger, a Milwaukee brewery owner who asked Biden a question during a TV town hall 20 months ago, and has since had a one-on-one videoconference with the president and seen Biden send a couple of letters to his grandson. It might be a small child \u2014 Biden likes to carry some cash so he can discretely slip kids a few dollars and encourage them to buy ice cream. It might be someone who stutters \u2014 they come in for special attention from the president. After Biden gave aspeech on student loanson Friday at Delaware State University, there were plentiful handshakes and photos with the students on stage. Last Tuesday, at a Democratic National Committee event in Washington, Biden invited one audience member backstage for a private photo, autographed some of the abortion rights signs that participants had been waving and mugged in a handful of selfies. Aides say the 79-year-old has perfected his selfie arm, the products of which are widely shared on social media. At an August event for Maryland Democratic gubernatorial candidate Wes Moore, Biden spent more than 75 minutes across three different rooms greeting people after the speechmaking had ended. He drew cheers when he grabbed hold of a high school drum major\u2019s baton and then posed with it for a photo before the marching band. It\u2019s all part of an approach Biden has largely perfected through decades of glad-handing in his home state of Delaware, whose population is just over 1 million and was about half that when Biden was first elected to the Senate in 1972. Scaling that kind of personal politicking to the presidential level has been a challenge, first as Biden campaigned for the Oval Office in the COVID-19 pandemic that curtailed his public engagements and now that he\u2019s in the White House, where the demands on his time \u2014 and the security \u2014 are greater. The hard fact, politically, is that one-on-one warmth and empathy only go so far. They helped him forge bipartisan bonds in the Senate but from the White House, most voters, most of the time, only see the president in scripted or staged moments. Biden aides have sought out ways to show voters the president\u2019s private interactions, with behind-the-scenes videos of some of the encounters, even if they are unlikely to ever have a chance at one themselves. Still, Biden insists that time be built into his schedule so he can interact with people at his events \u2014 such encounters seem to energize him and help inform his policymaking. There can occasionally be awkward moments, too, such as when a presidential quip lands poorly, that in today\u2019s partisan environment are often broadcast online by his political rivals. But they are outnumbered by the positive interactions that have defined Biden\u2019s career and tested the stamina of his aides. \u201cHe outlasts us,\u201d White House deputy chief of staff Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon told The Associated Press of Biden\u2019s penchant for spending 30 minutes, an hour, sometimes longer shaking hands. \u201cHe\u2019s going to take as much time as he wants,\u201d added Stephen Goepfert, Biden\u2019s former personal aide, or \u201cbody man.\u201d The president, whose poll ratings have risen in recent months but remain in negative territory, has held relatively few large political events in the leadup tomidterm elections.Many Democratic candidates don\u2019t see a Biden appearance as a plus. Aides say his schedule \u2014 and the size of his audiences \u2014 will pick up as his party pivots to get-out-the-vote efforts. But don\u2019t expect the small encounters to go away. Biden, aides said, seems to detect when someone may be going through a personal or family crisis \u2014 perhaps informed by his own experiences with grief and challenge: the death of his first wife and daughter in a car crash, the loss of his son to cancer, his recovery from a pair of life-threatening brain aneurysms, a decades-long struggle to overcome a stutter. \u201cHe just instinctually knows how to show up for what that person needs in whatever way that is,\u201d said O\u2019Malley Dillon. Goepfert followed steps behind Biden at hundreds of events during the campaign and in the White House before he left in August. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him comfort people who were in tears talking about their personal hardships, console somebody who\u2019s recently been diagnosed with cancer, honor a veteran servicemember with a handshake and one of his challenge coins, and also give a young person money for ice cream just for sitting through the speech \u2014 and all in the same rope line,\u201d he said. As Biden works his way through a crowd, he\u2019ll often summon an aide to take someone backstage for a photo, collect their information for follow-up, or jot down the phone number of a loved one who couldn\u2019t be there for a surprise call from the president. In his armored limousine after an event, Biden \u201cis ready to follow up with the people he met, and he\u2019s already making those phone calls,\u201d said Goepfert. Those fleeting encounters sometimes evolve into enduring relationships. Before he became president, Biden would frequently give out his cell phone number to young people looking for advice overcoming the speech impediment. Now that he\u2019s in the Oval Office, Biden is still in touch with many of them by phone, and sends taped feedback and words of encouragement from Air Force One. Thirteen-year-old Brayden Harrington\u2019s speech about how candidate Biden coached him to overcome his stutter was anemotional highlightof the 2020 Democratic National Convention. Another 13-year-old boy, Ryan, from Arlington, Virginia, continues to trade texts and video messages with Biden through staff after meeting the president at a 2019 rally. Ryan, whose mother asked that his last name not be used, said Biden has \u201chelped me be brave\u201d and join his school\u2019s choir. On another occasion, a brief Biden encounter with France\u2019s deputy ambassador about their shared connections to Ireland yielded a touching letter to the diplomat\u2019s\u201cover the moon\u201dson. Annie Tomasini, director of Oval Office operations, and her staff track Biden\u2019s interactions and coordinate the phone calls and letters that often follow rope line meetings. Some of these relationships have been going more than a decade. \u201cHe takes those engagements, and they stay with him,\u201d Tomasini said, adding that they are reflected in Biden\u2019s policy goals. \u201cIt really drives how he comes back and says, \u2018Hey, listen, guys, we need to focus on these pieces\u2019,\u2019\u2032 she said. His staff has gotten used to inquiries about specific issues that Biden hears about from Americans on the rope line or whom he\u2019s met when leaving church. \u201cIt just truly is who he is,\u201d said O\u2019Malley Dillon. \u201cHe\u2019s been in many of the shoes that the American people are in.\u201d Eichinger, co-owner of Black Husky Brewing in Milwaukee, hadn\u2019t thought much about it when Biden promised to follow up on a question he asked the president during a cable news town hall. He got a call a couple of days later from Ashley Williams, deputy director of Oval Office operations, looking to put him in touch with Biden\u2019s economic staff for a briefing and to schedule a Zoom with Biden that ended up lasting 30 minutes. \u201cI said I really didn\u2019t expect them to do that,\u201d Eichinger recalled. \u201cShe said \u2018No, that\u2019s not how he is. When he says something, he expects us to follow up and to keep that relationship going.\u2019\u201d Eichinger and his family later toured the White House over Christmas, and Biden sent his school-aged grandson a letter praising his violin playing after Williams showed him a video that Eichinger had sent. \u201cI\u2019m just one of 330 million people out here,\u201d Eichinger said. \u201cThey continue to feel that what I have to say is important.\u201d ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the elections at: https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections Check out https://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-elections to learn more about the issues and factors at play in the 2022 midterm elections.",

        "By LARRY NEUMEISTEROctober 24, 2022 GMT",
        " NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A Colorado businessman returns to New York Monday for a retrial oncharges that he cheatedthousands of donors to a $25 million online crowdfunding \u201cWe Build The Wall\u201d campaign to construct a wall along the southern U.S. border. Timothy Shea\u2019s first trial ended in early June without a verdict when jurors informed the judge that continuing to deliberate would leave them \u201cfurther entrenched in our opposing views.\u201d The case once included as a defendant Steve Bannon, a onetime top adviser to former President Donald Trump. Trump pardoned Bannon just before leaving office last year. Two others charged in the case pleaded guilty. The deadlocked jury came days after 11 jurors sent a note to the judge claiming one juror was politically biased against the government and in favor of Shea after labeling the rest of them as liberals and complaining the trial should have been held in a southern state. Jury selection in the second trial begins Monday morning in a Manhattan federal court. Last month, Judge Analisa Torres rejected Shea\u2019s request to move the trial to Colorado on the grounds that \u201cpolitical polarization\u201d in New York and publicity about his first trial made it impossible for him to get a fair result in Manhattan. She wrote that a jury note in his first trial might have indicated that differences in political opinions affected the jury\u2019s deliberations, but he had not shown that those differences reflected a prejudice against him. And she said he had not explained why \u201cpolitical polarization\u201d would be less pronounced in Colorado or anywhere else. Shea, of Castle Rock, Colorado, has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy and falsification of records charges lodged against him after questions arose over how donations were spent from a campaign that raised about $25 million for a wall. Only a few miles of wall were built. Prosecutors said Shea and other fund organizers promised investors that all donations would fund a wall, but Shea and the others eventually pocketed hundreds of thousands of dollars for themselves. Shea\u2019s lawyers said he acted honorably in the fundraising campaign and did not commit a crime. Shea owns an energy drink company, Winning Energy, whose cans have featured a cartoon superhero image of Trump and claim to contain \u201c12 oz. of liberal tears.\u201d",

    "Cheney: 1/6 panel won\u2019t let Trump turn testimony into circus": [
        "By HOPE YENOctober 23, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The House committee investigating the Capitol riot won\u2019t give Donald Trump the chance to turn a possible live TV appearance of hissubpoenaed testimonyinto a \u201ccircus\u201d and \u201cfood fight\u201d as lawmakers try to ensure he complies with their demands, the panel\u2019s vice chair said Sunday. The committee is demandingTrump\u2019s testimony under oath next month as well as records relevant to its investigation. To avoid a complicated and protracted legal battle, Trump reportedly had told associates he might consider complying with the subpoena if he could answer questions during live testimony. When asked if the committee would consider taking his testimony live, Rep. Liz Cheney on Sunday did not directly respond. She said the committee would not allow Trump\u2019s testimony to turn into a \u201cfood fight\u201d on TV \u2014 much as was seen, she said, in Trump\u2019s broadcast appearances such as one of his 2020 presidential debates \u2014 and she warned that the committee will take action if he does not comply with the subpoena. \u201cWe are going to proceed in terms of the questioning of the former president under oath,\u201d Cheney, R-Wyo., said on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on NBC. \u201cIt may take multiple days, and it will be done with a level of rigor and discipline and seriousness that it deserves. We are not going to allow \u2014 he\u2019s not going to turn this into a circus.\u201d \u201cWe have many, many alternatives that we will consider if the former president decides he is not going to comply with his legal obligation, a legal obligation every American citizen has to comply with a subpoena,\u201d she said. Her office made clear later that she and the Jan. 6 committee were not ruling out the possibility of live testimony. It did not indicate what form that might take to avoid the \u201cfood fight\u201d or \u201ccircus\u201d that Cheney said would not happen. The subpoena, issued Friday, calls on Trump to hand over documents by Nov. 4 and provide testimony \u201con or about\u201d Nov. 14. It is unclear how Trump and his legal team will respond. He could comply or negotiate with the committee, announce he will defy the subpoena or ignore it altogether. He could go to court and try to stop it. Last week,Steve Bannon, a longtime Trump ally, was sentenced to serve four months behind bars after defying a subpoena from the same committee. He remains free pending appeal. Former Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro also awaits a trial next month on similar contempt of Congress charges. The subpoena includes requests for any communications referring to extremist groups who were coming to Washington, pressure on state legislators to overturn the 2020 election vote and messages about Vice President Mike Pence, whom Trump was pushing to object to President Joe Biden\u2019s victory. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Sunday that she doubted Trump would appear for his deposition and that the public should know \u201cthat no one is above the law.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s man enough to show up,\u201d Pelosi said on MSNBC. \u201cI don\u2019t think his lawyers would want him to show up because he (would) had to testify under oath. ... We\u2019ll see.\u201d There remains little legal advantage for Trump to cooperate with the committee at a time when he faces other legal battles in various jurisdictions, including over hisfamily businessin New York and thehandling of presidential recordsat his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. It\u2019s possible that Trump\u2019s lawyers could simply opt to run out the clock on the subpoena if they go to court to try to squash it as the committee of two Republicans and seven Democrats is required to finish its work by the end of the year. Cheney, in the television interview, made her position clear that Trump had committed \u201cmultiple criminal offenses\u201d and should be prosecuted. She cited his repeated efforts as outlined by the Jan. 6 committee to undermine democracy by denying his election loss to Biden and by spurring his supporters in the violent attack on the Capitol. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear about a number of different criminal offenses that are likely at issue here,\u201d Cheney said. \u201cIf the Department of Justice determines that they have the evidence that we believe is there and they make a decision not to prosecute, I think that really calls into question whether or not we\u2019re a nation of laws.\u201d Cheney, wholost in Wyoming\u2019s August primaryafter becoming Trump\u2019s fiercest GOP critic and has signaled apossible 2024 presidential run, expressed dismay over the number of Republican candidates in the Nov. 8 midterms who deny the legitimacy of the 2020 election. She acknowledged that the Jan. 6 committee\u2019s investigation will be permanently ended in January if Republicans retake control of the House. While saying it may take \u201ca couple of election cycles,\u201d Cheney insisted the Republican Party can find its way back as a defender of democracy and the Constitution, as she put it. She pointed to the 2024 presidential campaign as a pivotal moment. \u201cI think that the party has either got to come back from where we are right now, which is a very dangerous, toxic place, or the party will splinter and there will be a new conservative party that rises,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if Donald Trump is the nominee of the Republican Party, the party will shatter and there will be a conservative party that rises in its place.\u201d She said Trump has shown \u201chis willingness to use force to attempt to stop the peaceful transition of power. And there are simply many, many millions more Americans who, despite any party affiliation, understand how dangerous that is.\u201d On whether she could run in 2024, Cheney said: \u201cI\u2019m focused on what we\u2019ve got to do to save the country from this dangerous moment we\u2019re in ... not right now on whether I\u2019m going to be a candidate or not.\u201d ___ For full coverage of the Jan. 6 hearings, go to https://www.apnews.com/capitol-siege ___ This story has been corrected to reflect that Cheney did not rule out the possibility of live TV testimony by Trump.",

        " REHOBOTH BEACH, Del. (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden will visit Democratic National Committee headquarters on Monday as he looks to pep up staff and volunteers with just over two weeks to go beforeElection Day. Biden is expected to deliver remarks that look to contrasthis plan to lower drug costsfor Americans while taking aim at a Republicans who he says will look to cut Medicare and Social Security benefits and look to make permanent the GOP\u2019s 2017 changes to tax rates, according to a Democratic official. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview Biden\u2019s remarks, said Biden will also discuss job growth, an unemployment rate that hovers near 50-year lows, anddeclining gasoline pricesduring his remarks to the DNC\u2019s Washington offices. Biden has stepped up his push in recent weeks to highlight his legislative wins for voters while trying to make the case that a Republican takeover of the House and Senate would lead to setbacks for American families. Last week, he delivered a mix of policy and political speeches on gasoline prices, hisbipartisan infrastructure bill, his push for student debt forgiveness, and the impact of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s June abortion ruling and efforts by Republican state legislatures to restrict abortion access. But his legislative wins come as stubborn inflation \u2014 consumer prices are up 8.2% from a year ago \u2014 continue to weigh heavily on Americans. A federal appeals court on Friday alsoissued an administrative stay temporarily blocking Biden\u2019s plan to cancel billions of dollars in federal student loans, throwing the program into limbo. Republicans looking to wrest Democrats control of the House and Senate have sought to make the the election a referendum on Biden. As a result, Biden has spent more time at fundraisers and touting his administration\u2019s policy wins this election cycle as his approval ratings remain underwater, and many Democrats aren\u2019t eager to stand by him on the campaign trail. ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the elections at: https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections Check out https://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-elections to learn more about the issues and factors at play in the 2022 midterm elections.",

    "Biden: \u2018Legitimate\u2019 for voters to weigh age as he nears 80": [
        "By AAMER MADHANIOctober 23, 2022 GMT",
        " REHOBOTH BEACH, Del. (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden joked that it\u2019s difficult acknowledging he\u2019s about to turn 80, but said he\u2019s physically and mentally capable of serving a potential second term in the White House. Biden, who turns 80 on Nov. 20, said it\u2019s \u201ctotally legitimate\u201d for voters to question whether someone his age can manage the demanding stresses of the American presidency. Biden made the comment in response to a question about his age during an MSNBC interview that aired Sunday. He said people should judge for themselves whether he is up to the task as polls show that voters would rather not see a rematch with Donald Trump, the Republican ousted by Biden in 2020. Biden would be 82 on Inauguration Day in January 2025; Trump would be 78,. A recent Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Researchpoll shows only about 3 in 10 people questioned want either Biden or Trump to run for president in two years. Just 5 in 10 Democrats want Biden to seek a second term, while 6 out of 10 Republicans hope to see Trump seek the presidency again. \u201cI think the best way to make the judgement is to watch me. Am I slowing up? Am I going at the same pace?\u201d Biden said in the interview that was taped Friday during a visit to the Delaware State University campus to promote his student loan debt forgiveness executive order. Biden has yet to officially announce whether he will run for a second term, but has repeatedly said it is his intention to seek reelection. During his 2020 campaign, Biden often presented himself as a \u201ctransition candidate\u201d who would build a bridge to new Democratic talent. The age and health of both Biden and Trump loomed throughout a race that was decided by a younger and more diverse electorate and at a moment when the nation is facing no shortage of issues of consequence. In the MSNBC interview, Biden said voters should look at his \u201cpassion\u201d for the work as they consider his age in factoring whether they should vote for him. Biden joked that he\u2019s still coming to terms with becoming an octogenarian. \u201cI can\u2019t even say the age I am going to be. I can\u2019t even get it out of my mouth,\u201d Biden said. Biden went through a battery of blood, physical, gastrointestinal, dental, vision and neurological examinations shortly before his birthday last year. Dr. Kevin O\u2019Connor, Biden\u2019s primary care physician, wrote in a six-page memo released by the White House after that exam that Biden was \u201chealthy, vigorous\u201d and \u201cfit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency.\u201d O\u2019Connor said he investigated Biden for increased instances of \u201cthroat clearing\u201d during public remarks and a stiffening of his gait. O\u2019Connor reported that Biden\u2019s coughing was the result of gastrointestinal reflux and that the stiffened gait was the result of a new diagnosis of \u201cmild peripheral neuropathy,\u201d spinal arthritis and compensation for a broken foot sustained shortly before he took office.",

    "Jan. 6 trial highlights missed warnings before Capitol siege": [
        "By ALANNA DURKIN RICHER and LINDSAY WHITEHURSTOctober 23, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 In a telephone call days after the 2020 election,Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodesurged followers to go to Washington and fight to keep President Donald Trump in office. A concerned member of theextremist groupbegan recording because, as he would later tell jurors in thecurrent seditious conspiracy trialofRhodes and four associates, it sounded as if they were \u201cgoing to war against the United States government.\u201d That Oath Keeper contacted the FBI, but his tip was filed away. He was only interviewed after Rhodes\u2019 followersstormed the Capitolon Jan. 6, 2021. The defendants are charged with plotting to stop the transfer of presidential power, and their trial is raising more questions about intelligence failures in the days before the riot that appear to have allowed Rhodes\u2019 anti-government group and other extremists to mobilize in plain sight. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to have been invited to a secret meeting of the Oath Keepers ... to know that the Oath Keepers presented a threat,\u201d said Mike German, a former FBI agent and fellow with the Brennan Center for Justice\u2019s Liberty & National Security Program. It\u2019s unclear to what extent authorities were tracking Rhodes and his militia group before Jan. 6. But it has since become apparent that authoritieshad plenty of intelligence warning that some Trump supporters were planning an assaultto stop the certification of Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s victory. Despite that, policeleft unprepared on the front lineswere quickly overwhelmed by the mob that engaged in hand-to-hand combat with officers, smashed windows and poured into the Capitol. Additional details emerged this month when the House committee investigating the attackdisclosed messagesshowing that theSecret Service was aware of plans for Jan. 6 violence. Jurors in the Washington trial, which is expected to last several more weeks, have received a trove of evidence from prosecutors. That includes Rhodes\u2019 secretly recorded call on Nov. 9, 2020, encrypted messages and surveillance footage from the Virginia hotel where the Oath Keepers stashed weapons for a \u201cquick reaction force\u201d that could quickly run guns into the capital if they were needed. Much of the evidence, however, has come in the form of statements and writings that Rhodes made publicly in the weeks before Jan. 6. They show how the former U.S. Army paratrooper and Yale Law School graduate was openly broadcasting his desire to overturn the election and threatening possible violence to attain that goal. Days after the election on Nov. 3, 2020, Rhodes announced on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones\u2019 \u201cInfowars\u201d show that his group was already mobilizing to stop the transfer of power. \u201cWe have men already stationed outside of D.C. as a nuclear option in case they attempt to remove the president illegally, we will step in and stop it,\u201d Rhodes said. Jurors also watched video of a speech Rhodes gave in December 2020 in Washington, where thousands of Trump supporters came to rally behind the then-president\u2019s election lies. Rhodes urged Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act, which gives presidents wide discretion to decide when military force is necessary, to call up a militia and \u201cdrop the hammer\u201d on the \u201ctraitors.\u201d \u201cHe needs to know from you that you are with him, that if he does not do it now while he is commander in chief, we\u2019re going to have to it ourselves later, in a much more desperate, much more bloody war. Let\u2019s get it on now while he is still commander in chief,\u201d Rhodes told the crowd. That day, Rhodes attracted the attention of a U.S. Capitol Police special agent who was doing counter-surveillance monitoring and had recently read a news article about the group. Rhodes was wearing a black cowboy hat, an eyepatch and an expired congressional badge from when he was a staffer for then-U.S. Rep. Ron Paul in the late 1990s. The agent took a photo and sent it to colleagues. Rhodes was also wearing a black cowboy as he roamed the exterior of the Capitol building as Oath Keepers entered on Jan. 6. Two weeks before the Capitol riot, Rhodes published an open letter to Trump on the Oath Keepers\u2019 website, suggesting that his followers may need to \u201ctake to arms\u201d if Trump doesn\u2019t act over what he viewed as a stolen election. Rhodes and his associates are the first Jan. 6 defendants to stand trial on seditious conspiracy charges. On trial with Rhodes are Thomas Caldwell of Berryville, Virginia; Kenneth Harrelson of Titusville, Florida; Jessica Watkins of Woodstock, Ohio; and Kelly Meggs of Dunnellon, Florida. Abdullah Rasheed, the Oath Keeper member who recorded Rhodes\u2019 call on Nov. 9, 2020, told jurors that that he tried to reach out to the FBI and others to share his concerns about Rhodes\u2019 rhetoric. When asked whether anyone called him back, Rasheed responded: \u201cYeah, after it all happened.\u201d An FBI agent acknowledged on the stand that the bureau first received a tip about the call in November 2020. Pressed by a defense lawyer about why the FBI didn\u2019t investigate at the time, another agent said the FBI receives thousands of tips a day. The tip wasn\u2019t ignored, but was \u201cfiled away for possible future reference,\u201d the agent said. The Nov. 9 call appears to have been to discuss plans for a \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally in Washington that would happen days later, not the Jan. 6 insurrection. But Rhodes throughout the meeting repeatedly tells his followers to prepare for violence, instructing them at one point to make sure Trump knows they are \u201cwilling to die for this country.\u201d Defense lawyers are not challenging many of the facts in the case, but say prosecutors have twisted the defendants\u2019 intent. The lawyers have acknowledged the group had a \u201cquick reaction force\u201d stationed outside of Washington, but say it was a defensive force to be used only in the event of attacks from left-wing antifa activists or if Trump invoked the Insurrection Act. The defense team has hammered on prosecutors\u2019 lack of evidence of any specific plan to attack the Capitol before Jan. 6. Rhodes\u2019 lawyers say their client will testify that all his actions were in anticipation of Trump calling up a militia under the Insurrection Act. Trump never did that, but Rhodes\u2019lawyers say what prosecutors have alleged is seditious conspiracy was merely lobbying a president to use a U.S. law. Prosecutors recently showed jurors jurors a map pointing to where Rhodes made several stops to purchase guns and other gear on his trip from Texas to Washington before the riot. He spent thousands of dollars on weapons, including a AR-rifle, ammunition, sights, mounts and other items, according to records shown to jurors. Rhodes and the others are not charged with violating gun laws. Authorities have acknowledged there is no evidence that any of the weapons stashed at the Virginia hotel that housed the \u201cquick reaction force\u201d were brought into the District of Columbia. \u201cSo the armed rebellion was unarmed?\u201d defense lawyer James Bright asked an agent. \u201cThe armed rebellion was not over,\u201d the agent responded. _____ Richer reported from Boston.

        "By ELLIOT SPAGATOctober 23, 2022 GMT",
        " SAN DIEGO (AP) \u2014 A surge in migration from Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua in September brought the number of illegal crossings to the highest level ever recorded in a fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The year-end numbers reflect deteriorating economic and political conditions in some countries, the relative strength of the U.S. economy and uneven enforcement of Trump-era asylum restrictions. Migrants were stopped 227,547 times in September at the U.S. border with Mexico, the third-highest month of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency. It was up 11.5% from 204,087 times in August and 18.5% from 192,001 times in September 2021. In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, migrants were stopped 2.38 million times, up 37% from 1.73 million times the year before,according to figuresreleased late Friday night. The annual total surpassed 2 million for the first time in August and is more than twice the highest level during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency in 2019. Nearly 78,000 migrants from Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua were stopped in September, compared to about 58,000 from Mexico and three countries of northern Central America that have historically accounted for most of the flow. Theremarkable geographic shiftis at least partly a result of Title 42, a public health rule that suspends rights to see asylum under U.S. and international law on grounds of preventing the spread of COVID-19. Due to strained diplomatic relations, the U.S. cannot expel migrants to Venezuela, Cuba or Nicaragua. As a result, they are largely released in the United States to pursue their immigration cases. Title 42 authority has been applied 2.4 million times since it began in March 2020 but has fallen disproportionately on migrants from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. U.S. officials say Venezuelan migration to the United States has plunged more than 85% since Oct. 12, when the U.S. began expelling Venezuelans to Mexico under Title 42. At the same time, the Biden administration pledged to admit up to 24,000 Venezuelans to the United States on humanitarian parole if they apply online with a financial sponsor and enter through an airport, similar to how tens of thousands of Ukrainians have come since Russia invaded their country. The first four Venezuelans paroled into the United States arrived Saturday \u2014 two from Mexico, one from Guatemala, one from Peru \u2014 and hundreds more have been approved to fly, the Homeland Security Department said. \u201cWhile this early data is not reflected in the (September) report, it confirms what we\u2019ve said all along: When there is a lawful and orderly way to enter the country, individuals will be less likely to put their lives in the hands of smugglers and try to cross the border unlawfully,\u201d said CBP Commissioner Chris Magnus. The expansion of Title 42 for Venezuelans to be expelled to Mexico came despite the administration\u2019s attempt to end the public health authority in May, which was blocked by a federal judge. Venezuelans represented thesecond-largest nationalityat the border after Mexicans for the second straight month, being stopped 33,804 times in September, up 33% from 25,361 times in August. Cubans, who are participating in thelargest exodusfrom the Caribbean island to the United States since 1980, were stopped 26,178 times at the border in September, up 37% from 19,060 in August. Nicaraguans were stopped 18,199 times in September, up 55% from 7,298 times in August. The report is the last monthly reading of migration flows before U.S. midterm elections, an issue that many Republicans have emphasized in campaigns to capture control of the House and Senate. Republicans on the House Homeland Security Committee released a one-sentence statement Saturday in response to the numbers: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding.\u201d",

    "Iran protests trigger solidarity rallies in US, Europe": [
        "By FARNOUSH AMIRI and MICHAEL BLOODOctober 22, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Chanting crowds marched in the streets of Berlin, Washington DC and Los Angeles on Saturday in a show of international support for demonstrators facing aviolent government crackdown in Iran, sparked by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in the custody of that country\u2019s morality police. On the U.S. National Mall, thousands of women and men of all ages \u2014 wearing green, white and red, the colors of the Iran flag \u2014 shouted in rhythm. \u201cBe scared. Be scared. We are one in this,\u201d demonstrators yelled, before marching to the White House. \u201cSay her name! Mahsa!\u201d The demonstrations, put together by grassroots organizers from around the United States, drew Iranians from across the Washington D.C. area, with some travelling down from Toronto to join the crowd. In Los Angeles, home to the biggest population of Iranians outside of Iran, a throng of protesters formed a slow-moving procession along blocks of a closed downtown street. They chanted for the fall of Iran\u2019s government and waved hundreds of Iranian flags that turned the horizon into a undulating wave of red, white and green. \u201cWe want freedom,\u201d they thundered. Shooka Scharm, an attorney who was born in the U.S. after her parents fled the Iranian revolution, was wearing a T-shirt with the slogan \u201cWomen, Life, Freedom\u201d in English and Farsi. In Iran \u201cwomen are like a second-class citizen and they are sick of it,\u201d Scharm said. Iran\u2019s nationwide antigovernment protest movement first focused on the country\u2019s mandatory hijab covering for women following Amiri\u2019s death on Sept. 16. The demonstrations there have since transformed into the greatest challenge to the Islamic Republic since the 2009 Green Movement over disputed elections. In Tehran on Saturday, more antigovernment protests took place at several universities. Iran\u2019s security forces have dispersed gatherings in that country with live ammunition and tear gas, killing over 200 people, including teenage girls, according to rights groups. The Biden administration has said it condemns the brutality and repression against the citizens of Iran and that it will look for ways to impose more sanctions against the Iranian government if the violence continues. Between chants, protesters in D.C. broke into song, singing traditional Persian music about life and freedom \u2014 all written after the revolution in 1979 brought religious fundamentalists to power in Iran. They sang one in particular in unison \u2014 \u201cBaraye,\u201d meaning because of, which has become the unofficial anthem of the Iran protests. The artist of that song, Shervin Hajipour,was arrested shortly after posting the songto his Instagram in late September. It accrued more than 40 million views. \u201cBecause of women, life, freedom,\u201d protesters sang, echoing a popular protest chant: \u201cAzadi\u201d \u2014 Freedom. The movement in Iran is rooted in the same issues as in the U.S. and around the globe, said protester Samin Aayanifard, 28, who left Iran three years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s forced hijab in Iran and here in America, after 50 years, women\u2019s bodies are under control,\u201d said Aayanifard, who drove from East Lansing, Michigan to join the D.C. march. She referred to rollbacks of abortion laws in the United States. \u201cIt\u2019s about control over women\u2019s bodies.\u201d Several weeks of Saturday solidarity rallies in the U.S. capital have drawn growing crowds. In Berlin, acrowd estimated by German police at several tens of thousandsturned out to show solidarity for the women and activists leading the movement for the past few weeks in Iran. The protests in Germany\u2019s capital, organized by the Woman(asterisk) Life Freedom Collective, began at the Victory Column in Berlin\u2019s Tiergarten park and continued as a march through central Berlin. Some demonstrators there said they had come from elsewhere in Germany and other European countries to show their support. \u201cIt is so important for us to be here, to be the voice of the people of Iran, who are killed on the streets,\u201d said Shakib Lolo, who is from Iran but lives in the Netherlands. \u201cAnd this is not a protest anymore, this is a revolution, in Iran.

    "Biden juggling long list of issues to please Dem coalition": [
        "By JOSH BOAKOctober 22, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden wants totame inflation. He wants Congress to protect access toabortions. He wants to tacklevoting rights. And he\u2019s taking on China, promoting construction ofnew factories, addressingclimate change, forgivingstudent debt, pardoning federalmarijuana convictions, cutting thedeficit, working to lowerprescription drug pricesandfunneling aid to Ukraine. Biden is trying to be everything to everyone. But that\u2019s making it hard for him to say he\u2019s focused on any single issue above all others as he tries to counter Republican momentum going into theNov. 8 elections. \u201cThere\u2019s no one thing,\u201d Biden said Wednesday when questioned about his top priority. \u201cThere\u2019s multiple, multiple, multiple issues, and they\u2019re all important. ... We ought to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. You know, that old expression.\u201d Biden\u2019s exhaustive to-do list is a recognition that the coalition of Democratic voters he needs to turn out Election Day is diverse in terms of race, age, education and geography. This pool of voters has an expansive list of overlapping and competing interests on crime, civil rights, climate change, the federal budget and other issues. The Republican candidates trying to end Democratic control of Congress have a far more uniform base of voters, allowing them to more narrowly direct messaging on the economy, crime and immigration toward white voters, older voters, those without a college degree and those who identify as Christian. In the 2020 election,AP VoteCastsuggests, Biden drew disproportionate support from women, Black voters, voters younger than 45, college graduates and city dwellers and suburbanites. That gave Biden a broader base of support than Republican Donald Trump and it also is a potential long-term advantage for Democrats as the country is getting more diverse and better educated. But in midterm elections that normally favor the party not holding the White House, it requires Biden to appeal to all those constituencies. \u201cCoherence and cohesion have always been a challenge for the modern Democratic Party that relies on a coalition that crosses racial, ethnic, religious and class lines,\u201d said Daniel Cox, a senior fellow in polling and public opinion at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \u201cIt takes considerable political talent to maintain a coalition with diverse interests and backgrounds. Barack Obama managed to do it, but subsequent Democrats have struggled.\u201d Biden devoted his public remarks this past Tuesday to abortion, Wednesday togasoline prices, Thursday to infrastructure and Friday todeficit reduction, student debt forgiveness and historically Black colleges and universities. In most of his public speeches, Biden says he understands the pain caused by consumer prices rising 8.2% from a year ago and that he\u2019s working to lower costs. Cox said there are signs that Biden\u2019s 2020 coalition is fracturing, with younger liberal voters not that enamored with him, and he does not appear to have done much to shore up Hispanic support. But compared with 2016, when Trump won the presidency, Biden made relative progress with one prominent bloc that generally favors Republicans: white voters without a college degree, as he won 33% of their votes compared with 28% who supported Hillary Clinton in 2016, according to a2021 analysisby the Pew Research Center. Keeping those voters in the Democratic coalition could be essential for maintaining control of the Senate. Biden hastraveled repeatedly to Pennsylvania, campaigning on Thursday forSenate nominee John Fettermanwith the goal of picking up a seat in the state. Fetterman, with his sweatshirts and shorts, exudes a blue-collar image, a contrast with the Republican nominee,Dr. Mehmet Oz, who rose to fame as a TV show host. \u201cDemocrats need to hold on to as much of that bloc as possible, especially in key whiter states like Pennsylvania, Ohio and Wisconsin,\u201d said William Frey, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. The test for Democrats is how to address broader concerns about the economy and inflation that affect everyone, while also highlighting the specific issues that could energize various segments of their base. That can involve trade-offs. As Republicans have made crime a national issue, Biden\u2019s message that he backs the police could help with those white voters. But it could also turn off younger voters in Senate races in Georgia and Florida who believe the police are part of the problem on civil rights, said Alvin Tillery Jr., a professor at Northwestern University and director of its Center for the Study of Diversity and Democracy. Tillery said he doesn\u2019t know how the president can bridge those differences, though Biden could be in a better position to focus on the policing overhaul that Democrats tried to negotiate with Republicans \u2014 only to be unable to reach a consensus that would be able to clear a GOP filibuster. \u201cMaybe they\u2019ve blunted some Republican attacks, but they\u2019ve also softened support for people who turned out for them in the 2020 election,\u201d Tillery said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how they solve for that, except to say they need to be more vigorous in saying the things they wanted to achieve were blocked in the Senate.\u201d Tillery added the overarching challenge might be that people view inflation as a domestic phenomenon, rather than a global one. Republicans are blaming high prices on Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief from 2021, whereas recent months have also shown that inflation is a worldwide trend driven in part by the aftermath of the pandemic and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, causing prices for energy and food to rise. \u201cThe reality is -- like all presidents -- he is a victim of things beyond his control,\u201d Tillery said. \u201cInflation is a problem globally. It\u2019s much worse in other parts of the world, but he can\u2019t message that way.\u201d ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the elections at: https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections Check out https://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-elections to learn more about the issues and factors at play in the 2022 midterm elections.",

    "Utah Senate race: Referendum on direction Trump has led GOP": [
        "By SAM METZOctober 22, 2022 GMT",
        " SALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 Just weeks before theNov. 8 vote, Utah\u2019s senior senator,Republican Mike Lee,is now acknowledging a real reelection threat fromEvan McMullin, an anti-Donald Trump independent and former Republican challenging him in the state\u2019s most competitive Senate race in decades. Lee\u2019s campaign insists it is confident heading into Election Day, but there are unmistakable signs of anxiety in a race shaping up as a referendum on the direction that Trump has taken the Republican Party. Lee recently sent out fundraising emails with the subject line: \u201cI\u2019m losing.\u201dIn an appearance on Tucker Carlson\u2019s Fox News program, Lee begged the state\u2019s other Republican senator, Mitt Romney, to \u201cget on board\u201d and endorse him. And speaking to reporters after a debate, the two-term senator said what his campaign had previously avoided saying: \u201cIt\u2019s close.\u201d In reliably Republican Utah,the attack on the U.S. Capitolon Jan. 6, 2021, has emerged as a potent issue after the House committee investigating the riot published Lee\u2019stext messageswith then-President Trump\u2019s chief of staff, Mark Meadows. In the exchange, Lee discussed ways to challenge the 2020 results in the days and weeks after the election. Lee has claimed he was merely doing due diligence and he notes that he did not join congressional Republicans who objected to the results when they were certified on Jan. 6, the day of the insurrection. Lee has not leaned into claims of widespread election fraud and manipulation of voting machines in the 2020 election that have been debunked by repeated audits, court cases and Trump\u2019s own Department of Justice. Shortly after the text messages were released, Utah Democrats aiming not to split the anti-Lee votedecided to back McMullinrather than nominate a Democrat. While Lee has tried to categorize McMullin as a Democrat, McMullin,who ran for president in 2016 as an independentandwon Lee\u2019s voteas a protest of Donald Trump, has said he would not join either party\u2019s caucus if elected to the Senate. \u201cI\u2019m not going to Washington to play the party power game,\u201d he said. Laura Knowlton, a Republican from right-leaning Davis County, cites the text messages as one of her reasons for voting for McMullin. She is certain they indicate further involvement from Lee in efforts to overturn the election. Knowlton doesn\u2019t understand how voters could ignore that. Yetin an election yearwhere many Republicans remain captivated by Trump and the voting fraud claims at the basis of his pursuit to overturn the 2020 outcome, she predicts some \u2014 including in her family \u2014 will vote for Lee out of party allegiance. \u201cThis will be a test,\u201d she said. \u201cCan you just excuse the things we know about Lee and blindly vote for him because he has an \u2018R\u2019 next to his name?\u201d McMullin has tried to use the texts to puncture the reputation Lee has worked to cultivate as a principled conservative deeply committed to the Constitution. McMullin has framed them as proof of how Lee\u2019s transformation from onetime Trump critic to loyal supporter puts him at odds with Utah voters yearning for an alternative to the direction that Trump has taken the Republican Party. McMullin argues the country\u2019s long-running partisan gridlock and the more recent threats to democracy are intertwined symptoms of a political culture that has veered toward extremes. He and campaign allies such as Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., haveurgedvoters to put aside their views on abortion, government spending and other issues so they can band together against what is portrayed as the existential threats to democracy posed by Trump and loyalists such as Lee. \u201cI would love to have the luxury to disagree on issues again. We\u2019re gonna argue taxes forever. But right now, we\u2019re fighting for the survival of this country,\u201d Kinzinger, one of two Republicans on the House\u2019s Jan. 6 committee, told an applauding audience at a campaign event for McMullin on Thursday in downtown Salt Lake City, one of Utah\u2019s most liberal-leaning areas. Lee has tried to focus the race on pocketbook issues such as the cost of living. He is aiming to appeal to Utah\u2019s Republican majority, making a case about how important he thinks it is for the party to retake the Senate In a debate this past week, he cited what he said was his his libertarian voting record and willingness to break from Trump. The senator said that \u201cseriously entertaining the idea of supporting an opportunistic gadfly supported by the Democratic Party might make for an interesting dinner table conversation. But this is not an ordinary year.\u201d Republican voter Bill Lee, a longtime Lee supporter who is not related to him, said McMullin has been forced to obscure his real positions on some issues in order to keep together the disparate coalition of Republicans, Democrats and independents that he needs. \u201cHe\u2019s playing a fine-line game, where he\u2019s trying to garner enough votes from three different groups to coalesce around some sort of margin of victory,\u201d Bill Lee said. \u201cBut if he talks too much on where he actually stands, he\u2019ll probably alienate one of those groups, so his game plan has been to stay as quiet as possible.\u201d Utah is a deeply conservative state, where the political culture borrows heavily from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. A majority of the population \u2014 including Lee and McMullin \u2014 are members. The faith\u2019s support for refugees and culture that teaches self-restraint often clashes with the direction that Trump has taken the GOP. Members of the faith lean Republican, yetpollinghas shown Trump commands less robust support among them than other prominent GOP politicians. Trump failed to win support from a majority of Utah votersin 2016and Joe Biden lost but performed better with Utah votersin 2020than any Democrat since 1964. Lee\u2019s 2020 remarks comparing Trump to Captain Moroni, a scriptural hero in the Book of Mormon, alienated some members of the faith and is the subject of a recent McMullin attack ad. Unlike other competitive Senate races where Republicans have tried toplay downand rebuff Democrats\u2019 efforts to make abortion a central issue, both candidates in Utah identify as anti-abortion. McMullin says he is \u201cpro-life\u201d but opposes extreme policies that criminalize women. Lee said at the debate he was \u201cdeeply thrilled\u201d with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in June to overturn Roe v. Wade. Though abortion is a key issue for her this election, Jenny Bech, one of the many Democrats who came to see McMullin and Kinzinger in Salt Lake City, said she plans to vote for McMullin. \u201cI think there\u2019s a sense of desperation from the voters,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a therapist and I can tell you people are very anxious.\u201d ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the elections at:https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections Check outhttps://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-electionsto learn more about the issues and factors at play in the 2022 midterm elections.",

    "EXPLAINER: Which states have abortion on the ballot?": [
        "By MIKE CATALINIOctober 22, 2022 GMT",
        " TheSupreme Court\u2019s June rulingthat overturned Roe v. Wade and left the question ofabortion rights up to the stateshas produced ballot questions in a handful of states this fall. Three states are asking voters some variation of whether they want to establish a right to abortion, while a single state is asking if its constitution should be changed to say there is no such right to abortion or for government funding. Kansas voters resoundingly rejecteda ballot measure that would have permitted lawmakers to tighten abortion laws or outlaw the procedure outright in August \u2014 the first such test since the high court\u2019s ruling. Let\u2019s take a closer look at what voters will be deciding when voting concludes Nov. 8: WHAT QUESTIONS ARE ON THE BALLOT AND WHERE? California,MichiganandVermontare all considering questions that would amend their state constitutions to establish some form of a right to abortion. Kentuckyis asking voters whether to amend the state constitution to say it doesn\u2019t protect the right to an abortion. Montanais asking voters whether to require medical care and treatment for infants born alive after an attempted abortion. WHY THESE QUESTIONS AND WHY NOW? The ballot measures come in the aftermath of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in June that the U.S. Constitution doesn\u2019t confer a right to abortion and \u201cthe authority to regulate abortion must be returned to the people and their elected representatives.\u201d Vermont Gov. Phil, Scott suggestedin a statement this summerthat the question had taken on new urgency since the court\u2019s ruling. \u201cIt is more important than ever to make sure the women in our state have the right to make their own decisions about their health, bodies, and their futures,\u201d he said. Kentucky has moved to tighten restrictions to abortion since the GOP took control of the Legislature in 2016, and Montana\u2019s Republican-controlled Legislature passed the legislation referring the question to voters before the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling this summer overturning Roe vs. Wade. Kentucky\u2019s Supreme Court is hearing arguments in a case over the state\u2019s near total abortion ban after the November election, but has kept thatprohibition in effectwhile the case is pending. Abortion is currently legal in Vermont, with no limit on when during a pregnancy it can be carried out. California and Michigan permit abortions before viability, usually defined as around 24 weeks. Montana restricts abortions after viability as well, but a court has put a hold on a measure that would bar the procedure after 20 weeks pending litigation. WHAT IS THE STATUS OF ABORTION IN THE STATES CURRENTLY? State legislatures and courts haveshifted the statusof abortion laws across the United States. Bans are in place at all states of pregnancy in a dozen states. In Wisconsin, clinics have stopped providing abortions though there\u2019s dispute over whether a ban is in effect. In Georgia, abortion is banned at the detection of cardiac activity \u2014 generally around six weeks and before women often know they\u2019re pregnant. Seven states, including the District of Columbia, don\u2019t restrict abortion by gestational range at all. ___ Mike Catalini can be reached at https://twitter.com/mikecatalini. ___ Check out https://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-elections to learn more about the issues and factors at play in the 2022 midterm elections.

    "Dems push Medicaid expansion for left-behind rural Georgia": [
        "By JEFF AMYOctober 22, 2022 GMT",
        " ARLINGTON, Ga. (AP) \u2014 Nine years after the hospital closed in the southwest Georgia town of Arlington, the worry about health care lurks. Health insurance premiums are high, many residents report poor health and there\u2019s no guarantee Calhoun County\u2019s sole ambulance will arrive promptly if it\u2019s taking a patient to a distant hospital. \u201cIf it\u2019s out on a call, you might as well throw them in the truck then and try to get somewhere,\u201d said resident Sam Robinson. Arlington, population 1,209, reflects the health care struggles of rural Georgia. Democrats, including their nominee for governor, Stacey Abrams, are showcasing those problems as they run for office this year, pushing for Georgia to join 38 other states in expanding the Medicaid health insurance program to cover all able-bodied adults. Abrams opened her campaign to unseat Republican Brian Kempat a hospital that closed in nearby Cuthbert, underlining an issue that was a centerpiece of her narrow loss to Kemp in 2018. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about someone who goes in for a checkup and is told that they have stage one pancreatic cancer,\u201d Abrams told reporters in a video news conference this month. \u201cIn Georgia, they are not entitled to a follow-up visit unless they can pay out of pocket.\u201d Experts project more than 450,000 uninsured Georgians would gain coverage if Medicaid were broadened. Many do not usually qualify for subsidies to buy individual policies, leaving them in what experts call the \u201ccoverage gap.\u201d Medicaid expansion is also an issue elsewhere this year. In South Dakota,voters will decide a referendum on expansionthat is opposed by Republican Gov. Kristi Noem. In Kansas and Wisconsin, Democratic governors are seeking reelection after failing to persuade Republican legislatures to broaden coverage. In Georgia, Kemp has refused calls for expansion, instead proposing coverage for a smaller group of people who meet work, education or volunteering requirements.In an Oct. 11 letter to Georgia\u2019s Democratic members of Congress, Kemp called full Medicaid expansion as \u201cfailed one-size-fit-none\u201d policy. But that refusal stings in Arlington, once home to the 25-bed Calhoun Memorial Hospital. It had been decades since babies were delivered at Calhoun Memorial and the facility struggled to afford the newest technologies. Although services were limited, local residents relied on it for emergencies. \u201cI used the emergency room with my son,\u201d said Pam Conner. \u201cHe was like 4 years old when he got his first very first wasp sting. It put him into anaphylaxis. I don\u2019t know what we would have done without a hospital.\u201d Conner chairs the county hospital board, nine years after the facility closed and laid off 99 employees. With many uninsured patients, Conner said the hospital was providing more than $2 million yearly in uncompensated care when it shut down. The county government borrowed for a new roof in 2008, and it\u2019s a sore point locally that taxpayers still owe nearly $500,000 on the building, now leased to a drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility. Local officials declined to raise property taxes to cover hospital deficits, unlike some Georgia counties. The hospital sold its nursing home, raising money but darkening long-term financial prospects. Finally, officials decided to close, joining eight other rural hospitals in Georgia since 2008. Now, Arlington residents rely on the county\u2019s one ambulance, based 12 miles away in Morgan. Calhoun County projects it will spend $537,000 to provide emergency medical services this year, more than one-eighth of its $4.2 million budget. Health care problems run deeper in southwest Georgia, though. Private health insurance is so expensive that Conner, whose family owns an insurance agency, instead buys coverage through the federal health insurance marketplace. Robinson said he and his wife once paid a combined $1,000 a month for insurance. Kemp has succeeded in reducing insurance rates and encouraging more insurers to offer coverage outside metro Atlanta with subsidies. But premiums remain high in southwest Georgia, with one large hospital in Albany dominating the market and residents often in poor health. Calhoun County has high rates of diabetes, obesity and births by teenagers,according to data from County Health Rankings. Black residents are much more likely to have preventable hospitals stays. Sherrell Byrd of SOWEGA Rising, which tries to improve well-being in southwest Georgia, said COVID-19 highlighted the region\u2019s poor health and rickety health care system. In early 2020, southwest Georgiadrew national attention with one of the highest death rates from the respiratory virus. \u201cIt really exposed how bad our health is,\u201d Byrd said. \u201cWe had so many comorbidities here.\u201d Medicaid has also flared as an issue in Atlanta, where the WellStar system closed a hospital in suburban East Point andwill by Nov. 1 close the 532-bed Atlanta Medical Center. That\u2019s one of only five top-level trauma centers in Georgia. WellStar says Atlanta Medical Center was losing so much money that Medicaid expansion wouldn\u2019t have helped, but Democrats persist in saying it could have made a difference over the long term. Having states provide Medicaid coverage to residents with incomes of up to 138% of the federal poverty line was envisioned in President Barack Obama\u2019s 2010 health care overhaul. But the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that the federal government could not force states to act, and many Republican-led states balked. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration has been trying to block Kemp\u2019s plan for a partial Medicaid expansion, but ajudge in August ruled Georgia could proceed with the work requirement. Kemp calls his approach a \u201cfar better approach to increasing health care coverage than \u2018full\u2019 Medicaid expansion.\u201d Kemp notes Medicaid expansion would force some people now eligible for private health insurance subsidies onto Medicaid. Because Georgia has set low Medicaid payments and some doctors don\u2019t take Medicaid, Kemp argues that would leave those people worse off while increasing competition for current Medicaid patients to find a doctor. The governor also notes 600,000 more Georgians are on Medicaid now than when he took office, basically arguing Medicaid expansion has already happened. Many people, however, are covered because the federal government has blocked states from dropping people from Medicaid during the COVID-19 pandemic. They could be removed once the federal public health emergency ends. Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock has tried to sweeten the deal, enticing lawmakers last year toboost the federal share of funding from 90% to 95%for the first two years of any new state Medicaid expansion. Warnock, seeking reelection on Nov. 8, has long called for broader coverage. He was arrested during protests over the issue at the Georgia Capitol in 2014 and the U.S. Capitol in 2017 before becoming a senator. \u201cUnfortunately, the state left that money on the table and left hundreds of thousands of working Georgians in the coverage gap,\u201d Warnock said Oct. 12 in Atlanta. \u201cAnd I intend to keep fighting for them.\u201d Warnock\u2019s opponent, Republican Herschel Walker, said last month that he opposes expansion. \u201cRight now, Medicaid has not been good,\u201dhe told reporters. \u201cRight now, the expansion is going to continue to bankrupt us. Everyone knows that.\u201d A key question underlying the debate is to what degree the government is obligated to provide health care and seek improved health outcomes. Democrats now largely believe health care is a human right and collective responsibility. Many Republicans still believe it\u2019s an individual responsibility. In Arlington, Conner says what actually existed was a mismatch \u2014 with hospitals legally required to provide emergency care, but not guaranteed payment. \u201cIt makes me say that universal health care might actually be a right of our citizens,\u201d Conner. \u201cIt\u2019s a right for them to go to the emergency room whether they can pay for it or not. But it\u2019s not a right for the hospital to get the money to pay for it.\u201d ___ Follow Jeff Amy at http://twitter.com/jeffamy ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage of Medicaid at: https://apnews.com/hub/medicaid Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the elections at: https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections Check out https://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-elections to learn more about the issues and factors at play in the 2022 midterm elections.",

    "Weapons shortages could mean hard calls for Ukraine\u2019s allies": [
        "By TARA COPPOctober 22, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Weapons shortages across Europe could force hard choices for Ukraine\u2019s allies as they balance their support forUkraineagainst the risk thatRussiacould target them next. For months, the United States and other NATO members have sent billions of dollarsworth of weaponsand equipment into Ukraine to help it fight back against Russia. But for many of the smaller NATO countries, and even some of the larger ones, the war has strained already-depleted weapons stockpiles. Some allies sent all their reserve Soviet-era weaponry and are now waiting for U.S. replacements. It can be difficult for some European countries to rapidly resupply because they no longer have a strong defense sector to quickly build replacements, with many relying on a dominant American defense industry that has elbowed out some foreign competitors. Now they face a dilemma: Do they keep sending their stocks of weapons to Ukraine and potentially increase their own vulnerability to Russian attack or do they hold back what\u2019s left to protect their homeland, risking the possibility that makes a Russian victory in Ukraine more likely? It\u2019s a tough calculation. After eight months of intense fighting, the allies expect the war will continue for months, maybe years, with both sides rapidly using up weapons supplies. Victory may come down to who can last longer. Thestockpile straincomes up \u201call the time,\u201d especially among smaller NATO countries, said Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur of Estonia, a Baltic nation that shares a 183-mile (295-kilometer) border with Russia. It weighs on them even as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has urged members of the Western alliance, at a recent NATO gathering in Brussels, \u201cto dig deep and provide additional capability\u201d to Ukraine. European officials, in public comments and interviews with The Associated Press, said Russia must not be allowed to win in Ukraine and that their support will continue. But they stressed that domestic defense is weighing on them all. \u201cOur estimation is that Russia will restore their capabilities sooner rather than later\u201d because Russian President Vladimir Putin can order weapons makers to go into 24-hour a day production, Pevkur said. Russia has directed some troops to factories instead of the front line, he said. The minister said Russia has a track record of reconstituting its military so it can launch invasions against European neighbors every few years, citingmoves against Georgiain 2008,Ukraine\u2019s Black Sea peninsula of Crimea in 2014and now all of Ukraine this year. \u201cSo the question is, \u2018How much risk are you ready to take?\u2019\u201d Pevkur said at a German Marshall Fund event this past week. Other smaller nations, such as fellow Baltic state Lithuania, face the same challenges. But so do some larger NATO members, including Germany. \u201cUkraine has led to a general shortage of supply because so many states have forgotten that conventional war is burning through your ammunition reserve. Just burning through it,\u201d Dovil\u0117 \u0160akalien\u0117, a member of Lithuania\u2019s Parliament, said in a phone interview. \u201cIn certain situations, even the word \u2018excess\u2019 is not applicable. In certain situations, we left ourselves with a bare minimum.\u201d Germany faces a similar situation, the ministry of defense said in an email to the AP. \u201cYes, the Bundeswehr\u2019s stocks are limited. Just as it is the case in other European countries,\u201d the ministry said. \u201cI cannot tell you what the exact stockpiles are because of security aspects. However, we are working to close the current gaps.\u201d For some NATO countries, it may not be possible to \u201cdig deep,\u201d said Max Bergmann, the European director for the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThey\u2019ve cut the fat essentially,\u201d Bergmann said. \u201cNow they are cutting into the bone.\u201d The stockpiles are low because for many European nations, military spending became a lower priority after the end of the Cold War, which weakened their defense industrial bases. U.S. defense companies also had a role as they moved in to compete for European contracts. \u201cWe wanted them to buy American,\u201d Bergmann said. \u201cWhen the Norwegians are operating F-16s and F-35s instead of the Swedish Saab Gripen\u201d fighter jets, it has an impact on Europe\u2019s defense market strength, he said. The U.S. has long urged other NATO member countries to increase defense spending to 2% of their GDP \u2014 a target most hadn\u2019t met. Since the Russian invasion, multiple European countries have pledged significant increases in defense spending to quickly reconstitute their militaries while they send Ukraine much of what they have on hand. Estonia has provided the equivalent of one-third of its defense budget to Ukraine, Pevkur said. Norway has provided more than 45% of its stock of howitzers, Slovenia has committed nearly 40% of its tanks and the Czech Republic had sent about 33% of its multiple launch rocket systems, according to the Germany-basedKiel Institute.The team based its analysis on an annual report on the known weapons and troop sizes of militaries worldwide published by the International Institute for Strategic Studies. The U.S. has committed more than$17.5 billion in weaponsand equipment to Ukraine since February, raising questions among some members of Congress as to whether it too is assuming too much risk. The Pentagon will not provide data on its own stockpiles. The Washington-based Stimson Center research group estimates the Ukraine war has reduced the U.S. stockpiles of Javelin anti-tank weapons by as much as one-third and Stinger missile inventories by 25%. It\u2019s also put pressure on artillery supplies because the U.S.-manufactured M777 Howitzer is no longer in production. Pentagon spokesman Air Force Gen. Pat Ryder said that when Austin recently met with the top government weapons buyers of scores of countries, he discussed the need to \u201cnot only replenish our own stocks as an international community, but also ensure that we can continue to support Ukraine going forward.\u201d Estonia passed a 42.5% defense budget increase this year to replenish its stocks. Germany is working on long-term contracts for high-grade munitions such as Stinger missiles and in September signed a 560 million euro ($548 million) contract for 600 new Navy guided missiles, with delivery planned through 2029. Restoring stockpiles and rebuilding weapons manufacturing capability will be a long process, said Tom Waldwyn a defense procurement researcher for the IISS. For some countries, \u201cit may require more significant investment in infrastructure. This will not be cheap as inflation and supply chain instability have pushed up costs,\u201d Waldwyn said. \u0160akalien\u0117 has been pressing other members of Lithuania\u2019s Parliament to start awarding long-term defense contracts now to rebuild the country\u2019s ability to defend itself. \u201cWithout making long-term sustainable decisions in expansion of military industry, we are not safe,\u201d \u0160akalien\u0117 said. \u201cThis decade is not going to be peaceful. This decade is going to be tough.\u201d ___ Associated Press writers Lorne Cook in Brussels and Lolita C.

    "GOP campaigns against the IRS, vowing to slash its funding": [
        "By KEVIN FREKING and FATIMA HUSSEINOctober 22, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 IRS pleas for more funding from Congress \u2014 made over the years by one leader after another \u2014 finally paid off this summer when Democrats tucked an$80 billion boostfor the agency into their flagship climate and health care law. Fortified with a new funding stream, the IRS is making plans to clear a massive backlog of unprocessed tax returns, upgrade technology that is decades out of date and, yes, hire more auditors. But, as GOP candidates across the country are making clear, the battle over IRS funding has only just begun. They are making attacks on a larger IRS a central part of their midterm election pitch to voters, warning that the Democratic legislation will bankroll an army of auditors that will harass middle-class taxpayers rather than help them. \u201cIf you pass it, they will come \u2014 after you,\u201d says an ad running in an Iowa House race that spoofs a scene in the \u201cField of Dreams\u201d movie. Instead of baseball players emerging from a field of corn, it\u2019s black-suited IRS agents. The GOP\u2019s warnings are generallyalarmist and misleading. The agency is not hiring an army of 87,000 \u201cnew agents\u201d to target low- and middle-class Americans. Many hires will be used to replace some 50,000 IRS employee retirements in coming years. Others will become customer service representatives answering taxpayer phone calls. Some of the IRS hires will be added to the ranks of sophisticated auditing teams that spend thousands of hours poring over complicated returns, but the Biden administration has also made clear that small business or households earning $400,000 per year or less will not see an increase in their chances of being audited. \u201cThe purpose of the funding is to modernize a severely underfunded agency to provide the American people with the customer service they deserve,\u201d said Natasha Sarin, Treasury\u2019s Counselor for Tax Policy and Implementation. But campaign politics has a way of becoming policy. With GOP ads against the IRS blanketing campaign airwaves, funding for the agency appears far from safe and could come under threat as soon as the next Congress is sworn in. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the speaker-in-waiting, has promised that if Republicans take the majority, passage of a billto repeal thenew IRS funding will be their first legislative act. While such a bill stands little chance of becoming law \u2014 President Joe Biden will retain veto power even if the GOP wins control of Congress \u2014 Republicans are unlikely to abandon the issue. Their greatest leverage over IRS funding will come when Congress takes up must-pass spending bills to finance government agencies or to avoid a government default on its debt. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economist and president of the American Action Forum, a center-right think tank, doubts that lawmakers will go so far as to force a government shutdown in a demand for less IRS funding. \u201cIf it was important enough to shut the government over it, the government would be shut,\u201d Holtz-Eakin said. He noted that lawmakers passed a short-term measure last month to finance the government into December and largely skipped the IRS fight. Still, some proponents of the additional IRS funding are concerned by the Democratic response to the GOP ads, or to be more precise, the lack thereof. Instead, Democratic groups and candidates are largely focusing their campaign ads on non-economic issues such as abortion rights. \u201cThere\u2019s crickets, is exactly the word, a crickets response from Democrats on this issue,\u201d said Frank Clemente, executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, a liberal-leaning advocacy group. \u201cThis is a story about messaging,\u201d Clemente said. \u201c... Candidates need to be talking about it. They need to be running ads on it. They need to be telling people how they\u2019re going to benefit, not just personally benefit by an improved IRS, but how rich and corporate tax cheats are going to have to pay the taxes that they owe.\u201d The IRS is still working on the details about how it would spend the extra $80 billion, but it has emphasized that resources would be directed at improving customer service and scrutiny at the high end of the income scale. Among other things, the IRS says its new funding will be devoted to remedying longstanding customer service issues \u2014 like answering the phone. The problem is so pervasive that a bipartisan group of lawmakers wrote to the IRS last November to complain about phone calls being answered only 9% of the time during the 2021 filing season. The IRS will also be tasked with coming up with how to move forward with an expanded free-file system for taxpayers. Nina Olson, a former head of the Office of the Taxpayer Advocate, said if funds are cut, taxpayers who have been hoping for better customer service will be most negatively impacted. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want the IRS to handle 85% of incoming calls, then cut the funding \u2014 if you want the IRS to continue to have technology that comes from the 1960s, by all means, cut its funding,\u201d Olson said. Democrats provided the funding boost to the IRS to help pay for other health and climate priorities, such as helping millions pay their health insurance premiums over the next three years and capping insulin costs at no more than $35 a month for Medicare beneficiaries. Of the additional $80 billion in IRS funding, the legislation allocated $46 billion for enforcing tax laws. The remainder goes to other activities such as services for taxpayers, operations support and updating business systems. Additional funding for the agency has been politically controversial since 2013, when the IRS under the Obama administration was found to have used inappropriate criteria to review tea party groups and other organizations applying for tax-exempt status. In the ensuing years, the IRS was mostly on the losing end of congressional funding fights, even as a subsequent 2017 report found that both conservative and liberal groups were chosen for scrutiny. In April, IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig told members of the Senate Finance Committee the agency\u2019s budget has decreased by more than 15% over the past decade when accounting for inflation and that the number of full-time employees at 79,000 in the last fiscal year was close to 1974 levels. Vanessa Williamson, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said if Republicans are successful in cutting funding for the IRS, \u201cit will seriously damage a fundamental function of the government,\u201d she said \u201cwhich is really troubling.\u201d \u201cThe reality is that government, through the IRS, plays a critically important role in the lives of Americans every day,\u201d she said. \u201cPretending that role doesn\u2019t exist to score political points is destructive.\u201d ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the elections at: https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections Check out https://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-elections to learn more about the issues and factors at play in the 2022 midterm elections.",

    "Republican committee sues Google over email spam filters": [
        "By JILL COLVIN and MICHAEL LIEDTKEOctober 22, 2022 GMT",
        " SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 The Republican National Committee hasfiled a lawsuitagainst tech giant Google, alleging the company has been suppressing its email solicitations ahead of November\u2019s midterm elections \u2014 an allegation Google denies. The lawsuit, filed in the District Court for the Eastern District of California Friday evening, accuses Gmail of \u201cdiscriminating\u201d against the RNC by unfairly sending the group\u2019s emails to users\u2019 spam folders, impacting both fundraising and get-out-the-vote efforts in pivotal swing states. \u201cEnough is enough \u2014 we are suing Google for their blatant bias against Republicans,\u201d said RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel in a statement to The Associated Press. \u201cFor ten months in a row, Google has sent crucial end-of-month Republican GOTV and fundraising emails to spam with zero explanation. We are committed to putting an end to this clear pattern of bias.\u201d Google, in a statement, denied the charges. \u201cAs we have repeatedly said, we simply don\u2019t filter emails based on political affiliation. Gmail\u2019s spam filters reflect users\u2019 actions,\u201d said spokesperson Jos\u00e9 Casta\u00f1eda, adding that the company provides training and guidelines to campaigns and works to \u201cmaximize email deliverability while minimizing unwanted spam.\u201d The lawsuit focuses on how Google\u2019s Gmail, the world\u2019s largest email service with about 1.5 billion users, screens solicitations and other material to help prevent users from being inundated by junk mail. To try to filter material that account holders may not want in their inboxes, Google and other major email providers create programs that flag communications likely to be perceived as unwelcome and move them to spam folders that typically are rarely, if ever, perused by recipients. The suit says Google has \u201crelegated millions of RNC emails en masse to potential donors\u2019 and supporters\u2019 spam folders during pivotal points in election fundraising and community building\u201d \u2014 particularly at the end of each month, when political groups tend to send more messages. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether the email is about donating, voting, or community outreach. And it doesn\u2019t matter whether the emails are sent to people who requested them,\u201d it reads. Google contends its algorithms are designated to be neutral, buta study released in Marchby North Carolina State University found that Gmail was far more likely to block messages from conservative causes. The study, based on emails sent during the U.S. presidential campaign in 2020, estimated Gmail placed roughly 10% of email from \u201cleft-wing\u201d candidates into spam folders, while marking 77% from \u201cright-wing\u201d candidates as spam. Gmail rivals Yahoo and Microsoft\u2019s Outlook were more likely to favor pitches from conservative causes than Gmail, the study found. The RNC seized upon that study in April tocall upon the Federal Election Commissionto investigate Google\u2019s \u201ccensorship\u201d of its fundraising efforts, which it alleged amounted to an in-kind contribution to Democratic candidates and served as \u201ca financially devastating example of Silicon Valley tech companies unfairly shaping the political playing field to benefit their preferred far-left candidates.\u201d Since then, the commission has approved a pilot program that creates a way for political committees to get around spam filters so their fundraising emails find their way into recipients\u2019 primary inboxes. Gmail is participating in the \u201cVerified Sender Program,\u201d which allows senders to bypasses traditional spam filters, but also gives users the option of unsubscribing from a sender. If the unsubscribe button is hit, a sender is supposed to remove that Gmail address from their distribution lists. As of Friday evening, the RNC had not signed up to participate in the pilot program. Republicans who have tried to cast doubt on the outcome of the 2020 election without parroting the most extreme and baseless claims about corrupted voting machines and stolen votes have often tried to blame big technology companies like Twitter and Facebook that they allege were biased against former President Donald Trump. A long list of state and local election officials, courts and members of Trump\u2019s own administration have said there is no evidence of the mass fraud Trump alleges. ___ Colvin reported from Akron, Ohio.",

    "Nevada court ruling modifies county plan for vote hand-count": [
        "By GABE STERNOctober 22, 2022 GMT",
        " RENO, Nev. (AP) \u2014 A rural Nevada county can start hand-counting mail-in ballots two weeks before Election Day, the state Supreme Court ruled Friday, but it won\u2019t be allowed to livestream the tallying and must make other changes to its plans. The ruling came in response to an emergency petition filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada, which challenged several aspects of Nye County\u2019s plan to start hand-counting votes next week. The ACLU saidin its lawsuitthat the plan risked leaking early voting results. It also said rules on touch screens to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act were too vague and restrictive, and that the county violated state law with its \u201cstringent signature verification\u201d for voter ID. Located between Las Vegas and Reno, rural Nye County was one of the first jurisdictions nationwide to act onelection conspiraciesrelated to mistrust in voting machines. Alongside the primary machine tabulation process, Interim County Clerk Mark Kampf\u2019s plans to publicly hand-count all paper ballots. The hand-count was first proposed to county commissioners by Republican secretary of state candidate Jim Marchant in response tofalse claimsabout Dominion voting machines. Sadmira Ramic, the ACLU of Nevada\u2019s voting rights attorney, praised the ruling. \u201cIt solidified our fight for access to the polls for Nye County voters, and democracy in general,\u201d she said by phone. Kampf did not immediately respond to an email request for comment. Friday\u2019s ruling \u2014 which was largely but not completely in favor of the ACLU \u2014 said that observers of the public hand-count must sign a form promising not to disclose information about the early voting results before the official results are released. Observers \u201care likely to learn election result information before the release of such information is statutorily authorized,\u201d the justices wrote. The justices also modified Nye County\u2019s signature verification process to allow voters more options to verify who they are if their signature doesn\u2019t match what\u2019s on their voter forms. Kampf previously said the county has the right to ask for a voter\u2019s ID if their signature fails. The court ruled that voters should be made aware of all three methods of proving their identity: showing ID, answering questions about their personal data on the voter registration application, or providing other personal data. The ACLU also argued that the county\u2019s method of using a touch-screen tabulator for people with disabilities would illegally allow election workers to ask about a voter\u2019s disability or turn away otherwise eligible voters based on \u201carbitrary decision making.\u201d The ACLU also said Nye County\u2019s wording of \u201cspecial needs\u201d to describe who accesses the tabulator is ambiguous. Kampf had said at a county commission meeting that anybody who says they need to use the touch screen tabulator would be permitted to do so. The justices ruled Kampf would have to stick to his word: the tabulator would be open to \u201call voters who seek it,\u201d the judge ruled. Nevada\u2019s least populous county, Esmeralda, used hand-counting to certify June\u2019s primary results, when officials spent more than seven hours counting 317 ballots cast. On Wednesday, Elko County\u2019s board of commissioners discussed their support for hand-counting and paper ballots, although they will likely have no hand-count this cycle as it\u2019s too close to when polls open. ___ Stern is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

    "Biden: Nearly 22M have already requested student loan relief": [
        "By DARLENE SUPERVILLEOctober 22, 2022 GMT",
        " DOVER, Delaware (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden said Friday that nearly 22 million people have applied for federal student loan relief in the week since his administration made itsonline applicationavailable \u2014 more than half of the number the White House believes are eligible for the program. Later Friday, though, a federal appeals court issued an administrative stay temporarily blocking Biden\u2019s loan cancellation plan. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals issued the stay while it considers a motion from six Republican-led states to stop the program. Speaking at Delaware State University, a historically Black university where the majority of students receive federal Pell Grants, Biden touted the first-week statistics since theapplicationwas beta-launched last Friday. He officially unveiled it at the White House on Monday. Biden\u2019s plan calls for $10,000 in federal student debt cancellation for those with incomes below $125,000 a year, or households that make less than $250,000 a year. Those who received federal Pell Grants to attend college are eligible for an additional $10,000. The plan makes 20 million eligible to get their federal student debt erased entirely. Biden highlighted theease of the application,which doesn\u2019t require users to upload any forms or to create an account. \u201cFolks, it takes less than 5 minutes,\u201d Biden said. He said the \u201cvast majority\u201d of applicants are able to submit for relief from their phones. It\u2019s unclear what the appeals court decision means for the 22 million borrowers who already applied for the relief. The Biden administration had promised not to clear any debt before Oct. 23 as it battled the legal challenges, but the soonest it was expected to begin erasing debt was mid-November. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre pointed out in a statement Friday night that the stay does not prevent borrowers from applying for relief, and it \u201cdoes not prevent us from reviewing these applications and preparing them for transmission to loan servicers.\u201d \u201cIt is also important to note that the order does not reverse the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the case, or suggest that the case has merit,\u201d Jean-Pierre added. Biden blasted Republicans who have criticized his relief program, saying \u201ctheir outrage is wrong and it\u2019s hypocritical.\u201d He added, \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it from MAGA Republican officials\u201d who had millions of debt and pandemic relief loans forgiven, naming GOP lawmakers like Reps. Vern Buchanan and Marjorie Taylor Greene, who received loan forgiveness, and Sen. Ted Cruz, who called some beneficiaries of student loans \u201dslackers.\u201d Asked Biden, \u201cWho the hell do they think they are?\u201d After the appeals court stay, NAACP President Derrick Johnson also called critics \u201chypocritical.\u201d \u201cWhen we bail out billion-dollar corporations, it\u2019s never an issue,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBut when it comes to lifting people who need the help most, including Pell Grant recipients \u2014 51% of which go to students whose families earn less than $20,000 a year \u2014 somehow it becomes an issue.\u201d",

        "By AAMER MADHANI and ZEKE MILLEROctober 22, 2022 GMT",
        " REHOBOTH BEACH, Delaware (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden on Friday suggested that more moderate Republicans aren\u2019t running for office in part because of their concern about their physical well-being. Biden made the comment in an MSNBC interview in which he repeated his concerns about \u201cmega MAGA\u201d Republicans \u2014 what he describes as a minority of the party that has come under the sway of former President Donald Trump and are pushing disproven claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election and other extreme views. \u201cI think one of the reasons there\u2019s not more mainstream conservative Republicans running out there is because they\u2019re so concerned about not only their physical well-being but also the notion that how can they win when a minority of Republicans are showing up to vote and they\u2019re really hardedge,\u201d Biden said in the interview. Biden made the comments not long after telling reporters earlier Friday that he believed the momentum will shift back to Democrats in the final days of the midterm elections and the party would do \u201cjust fine,\u201d as GOP candidates have tightened or pulled ahead in key races that will determine control of Congress with less than three weeks until polls close on Nov. 8. Offering an assessment of the political environment as millions of Americans have already cast ballots, Biden acknowledged that \u201cpolls have been all over the place\u201d ... \u201cwith them ahead, us ahead, them ahead, back and forth.\u201d But, he added, \u201cI think that we\u2019re going to see one more shift back to our side in the closing days.\u201d Biden said he was optimistic because \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see some of the good news on the economy.\u201d He noted gas prices have fallen in recent weeks and new federal data showed state unemployment was at an all-time low in 11 states and that 17 states had jobless rates below 3%. He was speaking at the White House abouta new report showing the deficit has shrunk in half from last year\u2014 a record reduction \u2014 even when including red ink from his plans to forgive student debt. \u201cRepublicans criticized my economic record, but look at what I\u2019ve inherited, and what I\u2019ve done and look at what they\u2019re offering,\u201d Biden said. Biden sharply criticized Republican plans to maintain tax cuts on the nation\u2019s wealthiest and undo his efforts to bring down prescription drug costs for seniors on Medicare. He claimed the GOP\u2019s proposals would raise the deficit by $3 trillion, and labeled their policies \u201cmega-MAGA trickle-down.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of policies that have failed the country before and will fail it again and will mean more wealth to the very wealthy, higher inflation for the middle class,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThat\u2019s the choice we\u2019re facing. That\u2019s why I think that we\u2019re going to do just fine.\u201d In the MSNBC interview, Biden also said his wife, Jill Biden, has encouraged him to run for reelection. He said, \u201cmy wife thinks that I -- that we\u2019re -- that we\u2019re doing something very important, and I shouldn\u2019t walk away from it,\u201d Biden said. He added that while he intends to run for a second term he is not ready to officially announce his reelection campaign. ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the elections at: https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections Check out https://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-elections to learn more about the issues and factors at play in the 2022 midterm elections.",

    "Ethiopians get temporary status in the US amid war at home": [
        "October 21, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Biden administration on Friday said Ethiopians already in the United States could remain for at least 18 months amid a war in Ethiopia\u2019s north that pits federal troops and their allies against Tigray\u2019s rebellious leaders. The Homeland Security Department estimates that 26,700 Ethiopians who were in the United States on Thursday will be eligible for Temporary Protected Status. \u201cEthiopian nationalscurrently residing in the U.S. who cannot safely return due to conflict-related violence and a humanitarian crisis involving severe food shortages, flooding, drought, and displacement, will be able to remain and work in the United States until conditions in their home country improve,\u201d said Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Fighting resumedbetween Tigray forces and federal troops in August, bringing an end to a cease-fire since March that had allowed much-needed aid to enter the region. Eritrean troops are fighting on the side of Ethiopia\u2019s federal military. About 250,000 Ethiopians live in the United States, with the largest concentration by far in the Washington, D.C., area. Congress created theTemporary Protected Statusprogram in 1990 to provide a safe haven for people unable to return to their countries due to natural disasters or civil strife. About 350,000 people from more than a dozen countries benefit from the status, which can be extended in increments of up to 18 months. People of El Salvador are the largest beneficiaries. Last week, the Biden administration expanded and extended temporary status for several thousand peoplefrom Myanmarafter a military coup last year in the Asian country. The Trump administration attempted to end temporary status for many countries but faced legal challenges.",

    "Graham asks Supreme Court to intervene after election ruling": [
        "By MEG KINNARDOctober 21, 2022 GMT",
        " COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) \u2014 U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham on Fridayasked the U.S. Supreme Courtto intervene after alower court ordered him to testifybefore a special grand jury in Georgia investigating whether then-President Donald Trump and others illegally tried to influence the 2020 election in the state. In a filing with the court, attorneys for Graham, a top ally of Trump\u2019s, sought to halt his possible testimony while he continues to appeal the order to appear before the Fulton County special grand jury. Graham\u2019s office described the South Carolina Republican\u2019s filing as an attempt \u201cto defend the Constitution and the institutional interest of the Senate.\u201d The lower court\u2019s ruling, Graham\u2019s office said, \u201cwould significantly impact the ability of senators to gather information in connection with doing their job.\u201d The legal move is the latest inGraham\u2019s ongoing fightto prevent his testimony in a case that has ensnared allies and associates of the former president. Some have already made their appearances before the special grand jury, including former New York mayor and Trump attorneyRudy Giuliani\u2014 who\u2019s been told he could face criminal charges in the probe \u2014 attorneysJohn Eastmanand Kenneth Chesebro, and former White House counsel Pat Cipollone. Paperwork has been filed seeking testimony from others, including former White House chief of staffMark Meadows, former national security adviserMichael Flynnand former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Graham, a four-term senator who last won reelection in 2020, wasfirst subpoenaed in Julyby Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who opened her investigation shortly after a recording of a January 2021 phone call between Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger was made public. In that call, Trump suggested Raffensperger could \u201cfind\u201d the votes needed to overturn his narrow loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Willis wants to question Graham about two phone calls he made to Raffensperger and his staff in the weeks after the election. During those calls, Graham asked about \u201creexamining certain absentee ballots cast in Georgia in order to explore the possibility of a more favorable outcome for former President Donald Trump,\u201d Willis wrote in a petition seeking to compel his testimony. Graham also \u201cmade reference to allegations of widespread voter fraud in the November 2020 election in Georgia, consistent with public statements made by known affiliates of the Trump Campaign,\u201d she wrote. She said in a hearing last month that Graham may be able to provide insight into the extent of any coordinated efforts to influence the results. Raffensperger said he took Graham\u2019s question about absentee ballots as a suggestion to toss out legally cast votes. Graham has dismissed that interpretation as \u201cridiculous.\u201d Graham has also argued that the call was protected because he was asking questions to inform his decisions on voting to certify the 2020 election and future legislation. Graham challenged his subpoena in federal court, but a judge refused to toss it out. Graham then appealed to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and a three-judge panel ruled Thursday in favor of Willis. Graham can appeal to the full court. Graham\u2019s lawyers argued that the Constitution\u2019sspeech or debate clause, which protects members of Congress from having to answer questions about legislative activity, shields him from having to testify. Graham is represented by former White House counsel Don McGahn, who was involved in a lengthy court fight over a congressional subpoena for his own testimony related to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. After years of back-and-forth, the two sides reached an agreement and McGahn answered investigators\u2019 questions in a private session. Graham\u2019s filing Friday was directed to Justice Clarence Thomas, who handles emergency appeals from Georgia and several other Southern states. Thomas can act on his own or refer the matter to the full court. Trump\u2019s lawyers recently submitted a Supreme Court application to Thomas asking the Supreme Court to step into a legal fight over the classified documents seized during anFBI search of Trump\u2019s Florida estate. Thomas has previously come under scrutiny for his vote in a different Trump documents case, in which he was the only member of the court to vote against allowing the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot to obtain Trump records held by the National Archives and Records Administration. Thomas\u2019 wife,Virginia \u201cGinni\u201d Thomas, is a conservative activist and staunch Trump supporter who attended the Jan. 6 \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally on the Ellipse and wrote to Meadows in the weeks following the election encouraging him to work to overturn Biden\u2019s victory and keep Trump in office. She also contacted lawmakers inArizonaandWisconsinin the weeks after the election, though no evidence has emerged that she contacted Georgia officials. Thomas was recently interviewed by the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection, and shestood by the false claimthat the 2020 election was fraudulent, despite the fact that numerous federal and local officials, a long list of courts, top former campaign staffers and even Trump\u2019s own attorney general have all said there is no evidence of mass fraud. ___ Meg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP ___ Mark Sherman in Washington contributed to this report.",

    "Justice Kagan: \u2018Time will tell\u2019 if court finds common ground": [
        "By JESSICA GRESKOOctober 21, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Justice Elena Kagan on Friday waded into the issue of divisiveness on the Supreme Court, saying that \u201ctime will tell\u201d whether the court can get back to \u201cfinding common ground\u201d after a term in which its six conservatives and three liberals split over contentious issues like abortion and gun rights. The liberal Kagan hasrepeatedly warnedover the last month that courts risk legitimacy and look political when justices needlessly overturn precedent and decide more than a case requires. Kagan said Friday it remains an open question whether the Supreme Court can begin \u201cratcheting down the level of decision making so that we can reach compromises.\u201d Kagan spoke Friday at the University of Pennsylvania, where she was interviewed by the school\u2019s president Liz Magill. The event was also livestreamed. The court,which opened its new term earlier this month, has given no signs it intends to shy away from major issues. On its agenda are cases that involve issues of race, voting and the environment. But Kagan said she believes it\u2019s better if the law moves \u201cin small steps rather than in big steps.\u201d If the court can\u2019t do that, she said, she \u201cwill spend a lot of my time dissenting.\u201d Still, Kagan said she likes to think of herself as a \u201cclear-eyed optimist.\u201d \u201cYou know that I\u2019m clear-eyed about the challenges and the difficulties but still remain hopeful,\u201d she said. Kagan spoke only obliquely about the decision of five of her conservative colleagues in June tooverturn the nearly 50-year-old Roe v. Wade decisionguaranteeing the right of abortion access. \u201cYou give people a right and then you take the right away, well in the meantime they\u2019ve understood their lives in a different kind of way,\u201d Kagan said, adding that \u201claw should be stable.\u201d Kagan was asked about a range of topics, including being the first woman to hold a number of jobs. Kagan, the fourth woman to join the Supreme Court, said in general she doesn\u2019t believe women think differently about the law than men do. She pointed toJustice Amy Coney Barrett, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, who joined the court in 2020. \u201cJustice Barrett and I, we agree about some things and we disagree about some things and being a woman just doesn\u2019t have all that much to do with it,\u201d she said. Kagan also talked about her interview for her current job with former President Barack Obama. Kagan was Solicitor General under Obama, his top Supreme Court lawyer, a position she called \u201cthe best job in America.\u201d She was initially considered for an opening on the Supreme Court that went toJustice Sonia Sotomayor. When another seat opened with the retirement ofJustice John Paul Stevens, Kagan was asked to interview with the president again. Things didn\u2019t quite go as planned, however, because theBP oil spillhad just happened. Said Kagan of the president: \u201cHe literally walked in and he said to me, \u2018I know you. We don\u2019t have to talk, right?\u2019\u201d Kagan acknowledged the president had a lot of other things to do. When she did get the job, she said, her first call was to now Attorney General Merrick Garland, then a federal appeals court judge, who was also under consideration for the slot. The two had known each other since Kagan was a Harvard law student. \u201cI was quite sure that if Merrick had gotten the job, I would have been the first person,\u201d he called, \u201cjust because that\u2019s the kind of person he is so I thought, I should try to be that kind of person,\u201d she said, calling him \u201cextraordinarily gracious.\u201d Kagan also answered a round of rapid-fire questions including her favorite binge-worthy television \u2014 \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d until last season and \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d \u2014 and what she likes to do if she gets a day off: golf.",

    "Politicians seek to leverage celebrities to reach voters": [
        "By JEFF AMYOctober 21, 2022 GMT",
        " ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 A beer garden near downtown Atlanta filled for a recent event hosted by Democratic U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock aimed at Latino voters. Some said they came to seek Warnock, who is seeking reelection inthe midterm electionson Nov. 8 against Republican challenger Herschel Walker. But others came to see a particularly high-profile Latino who would be speaking on Warnock\u2019s behalf \u2014 composer, actor and filmmaker Lin-Manuel Miranda. \u201cWho I\u2019m really here to see is Lin-Manuel Miranda, because I\u2019m a really big fan of his,\u201d said Camilla Estrada, of Atlanta, who described herself as liberal and said she plans to vote for Warnock. Celebrity endorsements in politics are nothing new, and it\u2019s unclear how much influence they have, said Mark Harvey, a management professor at the University of St. Mary in Leavenworth, Kansas. And some of the biggest fans at Miranda\u2019s appearance Wednesday night, like 7-year-old Sophie Hinsbi, clutching a book from the animated Disney musical \u201cEncanto,\u201d were too young to vote. But that hasn\u2019t stopped politicians from showcasing celebrities, hoping to reach voters who may be on the fence. Georgia Democrats spent the first week of the state\u2019s 19-day early voting period in frantic activity, as they implore supporters to vote in advance. Warnock and gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams each held multiple events a day. Miranda also appeared with Abrams at a restaurant in suburban Lawrenceville on Wednesday, while the Abrams campaign later rolled out a recorded chatwith Oprah Winfrey on Thursday night. Almost 575,000 people had voted in Georgia by the end of Thursday, roughly on pace with the 2020 presidential election when 5 million votes were cast in the state, buoying Democratic hopes that a big turnout might help them. Celebrities have also gone directly into politics in 2022, including Walker, a University of Georgia football star. When Walker interacts with voters, fans line up to implore him to sign jerseys and even commemorative soda bottles from the Bulldogs\u2019 1980 national championship. There\u2019s also Pennsylvania Republican Senate candidate Mehmet Oz,a doctor who made a fortune as a TV show host. They\u2019re following the footsteps of others, including former President Donald Trump. Harvey said his research showed Trump was particularly effective at dominating news coverage in 2016, and noted that he had heard a lot about Walker despite living far from Georgia. \u201cWhen you get a celebrity in there, you\u2019re probably going to get a whole lot more free coverage,\u201d Harvey said. In Atlanta, Miranda noted that he had a history of supporting Warnock, mentioning an online fundraiser that the original cast of \u201cHamilton\u201d held for Warnock and fellow Democrat Jon Ossoff in 2020, as the two were pushing toward January 2021 runoff victories that gave Democrats control of the Senate. Both he and Warnock argued that the stakes are just as high this year. \u201cYou hate to be the guy who quotes the lyrics from the band, but history has its eyes on you,\u201d Miranda told the crowd, recycling the title of one \u201cHamilton\u2019s\u201d many popular songs. Harvey, who wrote a 2017 book about celebrity influence in politics, said there\u2019s strong evidence that celebrities can draw media attention to issues. Less clear is whether a celebrity can spur a disengaged voter to cast a ballot. \u201cWhether or not it goes from somebody\u2019s brain having read it to \u2019Now I care about the race,\u201d that\u2019s something that I think is very difficult to document,\u201d Harvey said. The professor said research on celebrities who endorse and market products shows such advertising is \u201cnot nearly effective as you might think.\u201d Harvey said that it might be reasonable to assume that celebrity endorsements of candidates might be similarly hit-or-miss. Still, famous people continue to wade into politics. Democrat Cisco Aguilar, running for secretary of state in Nevada, rolled out an endorsement video from Miranda on Friday. Pennsylvania Democratic Senate candidate John Fetterman hosted a fundraiser with \u201cAnt Man\u201d star Paul Rudd this week, and musician Dave Matthews will play at a Fetterman rally in Pittsburgh next week. Mixed martial artists, including several who have publicly supported Trump are the celebrities of choice for some Republicans. In Arizona, Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake has been making appearances with former Ultimate Fighting Championship champion and Olympic wrestling gold medalist Henry Cejudo, calling them fight nights, and appearing on a stage adorned with an American flag and punching bags. \u201cThey never back down from a fight,\u201d Lake\u2019s campaign wrote in an email to supporters. \u201cJoin these two champions for a knock out night fighting for Arizona.\u201d In Nevada, Republican candidate for governor Joe Lombardo was endorsed Thursday by Dana White, the president of UFC, hailing Lombardo\u2019s law enforcement credentials. \u201cSheriff Lombardo kept law and order here in Vegas,\u201d White said in a video. \u201cHe protected our businesses and our families and kept our streets and schools safe.\u201d In Georgia,Kemp has attacked Abrams as \u201cCelebrity Stacey,\u201d saying last month that Abrams is \u201crunning her campaign to cater to liberal elites\u201d and not to Georgians, and mocking Abrams, a Star Trek fan, for her cameo appearance earlier this year as president of Earth in \u201cStar Trek: Discovery.\u201d \u201cWhile Stacey Abrams continues to solicit the help of out-of-state billionaires,\u201d Kemp spokesperson Tate Mitchell said after Thursday\u2019s Oprah Winfrey event, \u201cGov. Kemp will continue to talk to hardworking Georgians about his record of economic success and plan to build a safer, stronger Georgia.\u201d Abrams, though, told reporters after her appearance with Miranda that she\u2019s not worried about her celebrity appearances backfiring, noting Georgia\u2019s burgeoning film and television industry, which is financed by state tax credits. \u201cAm I concerned that famous people who pour $4.4 billion into our economy know where Georgia is?\u201d she said. \u201cNo I\u2019m not.\u201d ___ Follow Jeff Amy at http://twitter.com/jeffamy Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the elections at: https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections Check outhttps://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-electionsto learn more about the issues and factors at play in the 2022 midterm elections.",

    "GOP\u2019s Georgia challenge: Persuading Trump backers to vote": [
        "By LISA MASCAROOctober 21, 2022 GMT",
        " MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) \u2014 On a crisp fall morning, eager volunteers fanned out in the leafy suburban Atlanta neighborhood to knock on doors, trying to persuade reluctant and skeptical conservatives to register to vote in next month\u2019smidterm elections. It\u2019s painstaking work anywhere, but especially pivotal in battleground Georgia, as Donald Trump\u2019s lies of a rigged 2020 election have created a new constituency of election deniers -- some wary their votes won\u2019t be counted in November. Dispatching the group on the hunt for votes was an unlikely emissary \u2014former Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who initially stood by the defeated president\u2019s effort to undo Joe Biden\u2019s victory, but was now working, in blue jeans and a country plaid shirt, to bring election skeptics back to the polls. \u201cWe saw it firsthand in our election,\u201d Loeffler said about the drop-off during an interview outside the Cobb County Republican Party headquarters where the volunteers gathered on a recent Saturday. Loeffler recounted to The Associated Press how she lost her seat to Democrat Raphael Warnock in January 2021 after more than 330,000 Republicans who voted in the 2020 presidential election failed to cast ballots in the January 2021 runoff. As Warnock now faces Republican Herschel Walkerin a race that could determine the balance of power in the U.S. Senate,Loeffler is trying to prevent a repeat. \u201cThis effort is about amplifying Georgia\u2019s voices and taking our state back and saying that we will not be silenced,\u201d Loeffler said, pumping up the volunteers before sending them out. \u201cWe know that when people feel like their vote counts, they\u2019re more likely to vote.\u201d It\u2019s a singular mission with uncertain prospects in November, the first national election in the aftermath of Trump\u2019s repeated attacks on the U.S. voting system and theJan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitolby Trump supporters trying to stop the certification of Biden\u2019s election. And it comes as Republicans in Georgia and nationwide are trying to hold together a fragile coalition of voters \u2014 those who embrace Trump\u2019s claim of fraud and those who reject it. \u201cThat reflects a real tension in the Republican Party messaging,\u201d said Lee Drutman, a senior fellow at New America, a Washington-based think tank, who specializes in democracy issues. \u201cIt may be self-defeating to say the election is rigged if you have to actually get people out to vote.\u201d Voters appear eager to cast ballots this fall. Anew poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center of Public Affairs Researchfinds 71% of registered voters think the very future of the U.S. is at stake when they vote this year. Yetthe poll also founda large segment of Republicans, 58%, still believe Biden\u2019s election wasn\u2019t legitimate. Brian Robinson, a GOP strategist, said Georgians have moved on from Trump\u2019s claims, judging by the primary election victories this year for Brad Raffensperger, the embattled secretary of state Trump unsuccessfully asked to \u201cfind 11,780\u201d votes, and incumbent Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who drew Trump\u2019s ire for standing by the state\u2019s results. \u201cBy almost any measure, Georgia voters have moved past the 2020 election and at this juncture have largely rejected claims that fraud marred the election outcome,\u201d Robinson said. But Democrats say Republicans are trying to have it both ways, courting what one strategist called MAGAs and moderates, referring to Trump\u2019s Make America Great Again supporters. While Loeffler toutsGeorgia\u2019s new election lawas preventing fraud, Democrats argue the GOP-led bill was unnecessary, a reaction to Trump\u2019s lies about 2020. Loeffler is in many ways an imperfect messenger, one who initially denied the 2020 election results. She stood on stage at Trump rallies as he spread his claims of a stolen presidential election. She called on Raffensperger to resign over his handling of the vote. Loeffler promised Trump rally voters she would object to the electoral count in Congress, drawing cheers from the crowd, only to abandon the effort hours after the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol. A wealthy former businesswoman who remains close to Trump, Loeffler has invested more than $2 million in Greater Georgia and its companion Citizens for Greater Georgia get-out-the vote effort for Republicans. She is modeling her work partly after Democrat Stacey Abrams, the gubernatorial candidate, whose voting rights efforts have catapulted her into a national figure in herrematchagainst Kemp. \u201cI said from Day One when I started this effort, we cannot allow the left to have a monopoly on voter registration in our state,\u201d Loeffler said about the group she launched after her defeat. The diverse group of Greater Georgia volunteers broke into a hand-clap chant of \u201cWe will knock you!\u201d \u2014 a nod to the Queen song \u2013\u2014 at a cul-de-sac in Marietta before separating into smaller groups to canvass the well-appointed middle class homes. Trump voter Lisa Buxton said she joined Loeffler\u2019s effort because she was tired of \u201cthrowing things at my television\u201d in the year after the former president\u2019s defeat. Buxton said she was sad after Trump\u2019s loss and formed her own women\u2019s church group Christians Taking Action and Prayer around voting and election strategies. \u201cOur motto is we know what has happened. We know what\u2019s in the past. We\u2019re going forward,\u201d she said. Asked if Biden was the legitimate president, she gave a long pause. \u201cHe\u2019s sitting in the chair,\u201d she said. \u201cThe electoral college said he\u2019s there. So he\u2019s there. That\u2019s where I am. I\u2019m not going to go down that rabbit hole \u2019cause I could jump up and down and scream a whole lot.\u201d The challenge of reaching skeptical voters the final weekend before the deadline was clear. Georgia already has high voter registration, and volunteers were met that day mostly with residents not answering their door or having moved on \u2014 literally and politically. Homeowner Scott Davenport said the neighborhood used to be all Republicans, but the days are long gone when he used to stake a giant Newt Gingrich sign in his lawn supporting the former House GOP speaker. Davenport, a father of two adult daughters who works in commercial real estate, said in the Trump era he started voting for Democrats. He said the Republican Party\u2019s rhetoric around racial issues and its denial of the 2020 election results was not what he had signed up for. \u201cI didn\u2019t leave the Republican Party, the Republican Party left me,\u201d he said, raking leaves as the canvassers, who did not have him on their priority list, skipped his house. \u201cFor me, they\u2019ve just gone too far.\u201d",
