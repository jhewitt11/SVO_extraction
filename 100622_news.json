    "Graham, Cruz tell Mayorkas he's on notice for possible impeachment over border crisis": [
        " \n        By\n        Brianna Herlihy   | Fox News ",
        " EXCLUSIVE:GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, joined forces to send a message to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas that they have \"grounds for impeachment\" if he fails to act swiftly in correcting his \"gross dereliction of duty\" at the southern border. In a letter to Mayorkas on Tuesday evening exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital, the senators compiled data produced by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) that show that the crisis at the southern border has deteriorated since Mayorkas took office 19 months ago. \"This is gross dereliction of duty and, if not corrected swiftly, could provide grounds for impeachment,\" the senators wrote. \"Yourfailure to faithfully enforcethis nation\u2019s immigration laws and willful blindness to the very real humanitarian crisis at our southern border amounts to a gross dereliction of duty and a violation of your oath of office,\" the senators wrote. \"Despite the heroic efforts by the men and women of Border Patrol, who operate with very little support from Washington, D.C., you have failed to achieve any semblance of operational control of the southern border,\" they continued. According to CBP, there have been \"over 4.4 million illegal crossings, including over 3.5 million apprehensions by CBP and at least 900,000 gotaways, who evaded apprehension.\" In addition to the record-high border crossings and migrant encounters, the senators charge Mayorkas with enabling a drug production and smuggling enterprise by Mexican cartels with China-supplied drug ingredients that directly contributed to the \"fentanyl-fueled\" opioid pandemic that killed108,000 Americans last year. Fentanyl, which has become the leading cause of death of Americans ages 18 to 45, is \"streaming across our southern border,\" the senators wrote, noting that just last month2,287 pounds of fentanylwere seized by CBP agents \u2014 enough to kill more than 500 million people. \"Drug cartels produce bulk amounts of fentanyl in Mexico, using the Chinese-supplied ingredients, and smuggle the drug across the U.S.-Mexico border,\" the senators explained in their letter. \"This amounts to a multi-billion dollar business for transnational criminal organizations, who then launder the money out of the United States and back into China.\" \"This lucrative illicit enterprise continues to thrive\u2014while Americans die\u2014all because DHS has ceded control of our southern border to the cartels for political gain,\" they continued. DHS IG REPORT OUTLINES HOW BORDER PATROL FACILITIES IN DEL RIO SECTOR WERE OVERWHELMED BY MIGRANT SURGE The senators also warned that the \"chaos\" at the southern border \"presents a prime opportunity for terrorists to enter the United States undetected,\" especially following the \"disastrous withdrawal\" of U.S. troops from Afghanistan last year, noting that border patrol agents have apprehended at \"least 78 individuals on the Terrorist Screening Database\" so far in fiscal year 2022 \u2014 more than twice as many apprehended in the past five fiscal years combined. \"It is a near certainty that terrorists have already entered the United States undetected, taking advantage of the lenient border policies you have put into place,\" the senators wrote. \"It is only a matter of time until we will see an attack on American soil from such terrorists.\" ARIZONA DISTRIBUTES FENTANYL TESTING STRIPS AS DEADLY PILLS DISGUISED AS OTHER DRUGS FLOW ACROSS BORDER Both Graham and Cruz, who serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee, prior to this letter have implored Mayorkas and the White House numerous times to make changes and address the border crisis. Collectively, the Republican senators have visited the border six times in the last two years. Neither President Joe Biden nor \"border czar\" Vice President Kamala Harris have visited the border since taking office, the senators noted in their letter. \"You have stated multiple times that \"the border is secure\" even as the crisis rages on,\" the senators wrote. \"Vice President Harris apparently shares this same delusion. Perhaps if she or President Biden would visit the southern border and actually see the unending surge of illegal immigration, illicit drugs and human suffering, the White House would feel differently,\" they state. BETO O'ROURKE SAYS BIDEN ADMIN 'CERTAINLY' NEEDS 'TO DO MORE' TO FIND SOLUTIONS ON BORDER CRISIS The White House has repeatedly denied claims of a crisis at the southern border. Most recently, Harris twice declared that the U.S. southern border is \"secure\" during an interview last month, despite a record number of migrants crossing into the country. \"We fully expect that in a few months\u2019 time a Republican-led Congress will hold you to account for your willful negligence regarding the security of the southern border and the safety of the American people,\" the senators conclude. DHS did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment on the letter.",

    "Diversity, equity, inclusion dominate Biden admin's policy priorities across agencies": [
        " \n        By\n        Peter Kasperowicz   | Fox News ",
        " The Treasury Department's launch of a new advisory committee on racial equity is just one of dozens of ways in which the federal government is working to advance President Biden's sweeping diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility (DEIA) agenda. \"We know that we need to do all we can to build a fairer economy, and that\u2019s why we have put racial equity at the forefront of our agenda at Treasury and across the Biden administration,\"Treasury Secretary Janet Yellensaid Tuesday as she announced the equity committee. The Treasury committee is a natural extension of theadministration\u2019s broad effort to promote \"equity\"that started with an executive order on advancing racial equity that Biden issued on his first day in office. Yellen said the administration has pursued that goal in bills like the American Rescue Plan, which aspires to build a foundation for an \"equitable economic recovery,\" and the infrastructure bill, which she said will boost investment in communities \"that have often been ignored or overlooked.\" Treasury is one of several federal agencies taking its cue from the White House. In the run-up to the midterm elections, the White House has put up a series of posts about equity as it relates to federal grant funding, federally funded research, stopping the spread of monkeypox and access to infrastructure contracts. BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WANTS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO BE DIVERSITY, EQUITY MODEL FOR THE NATION DEIA has also attached itself to other Biden administration priorities, such as climate change. Just last week,Vice President Harris caused a stirwhen she said assistance to climate-ravaged areas of the country must be distributed with \"equity\" in mind, which many Republicans interpreted as a sign that relief for Hurricane Ian in Florida might be doled out according to race. The White House later clarified that Harris was not talking about relief specific to Hurricane Ian when she said low-income communities and communities of color are most vulnerable to climate change, and that the government needs to \"address this in a way that is about giving resources based on equity.\" VICE CHAIR OF TREASURY DEPT'S NEW RACIAL EQUITY COMMITTEE WANTS TO DEFUND THE POLICE, \u2018CENTER RACE\u2019 IN ALL POLICY Between Biden's executive order and the drumbeat of attention to diversity and equity created by the White House, other major federal departments have taken their own steps to advance DEIA: The U.S. Department of Agriculture launched an Equity Commission at the start of 2022 to advise the secretary on how programs and practices within the department \"contribute to barriers to inclusion or access, systemic discrimination, or exacerbate or perpetuate racial, economic, health and social disparities.\" USDA says the commission will confront the \"hard reality of past discrimination and its lingering harm.\" The group last met in late September, and it hopes to submit a final report on its findings next year. The Commerce Department released a 20-page \"Equity Action Plan\" in April that says officials will work to build \"innovation ecosystems in historically underserved communities,\" expand assistance to minority businesses and make DOC resources more available to underserved communities. In late September, the Pentagon announced a new defense advisory committee on diversity and inclusion, which will provide advice and recommendations on \"matters and policies relating to the improvement of racial/ethnic diversity, inclusion and equal opportunity within the department.\" A week later, DOD released a 37-page plan to promote DEIA. This week, the Department of Energy announced $116 million in grants for programs focused on \"equity and accessibility\" for students and announced it will soon appoint members to an advisory commission to promote equity and opportunity for Hispanics. Last week, it announced a plan to address \"digital equity,\" and on Sept. 1, it released a plan to advance DEIA within the department. This week, the Department of Health and Human Services announced nearly $5 million in grants to 10 organizations under a program aimed at addressing factors that contribute to \"structural racism in public health.\" The funding will help identify policies that \"may create or perpetuate health disparities and may contribute to structural racism.\" HHS also awarded $2 million in grant funding to groups focused on \"health equity.\" \u2018WOKE\u2019 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE EQUITY CHIEF WRITES ANTI-WHITE POSTS: \u2018EXHAUSED WITH THESE WHITE FOLX\u2019 In mid-September, the Department of Homeland Security awarded $20 million in funding to 43 groups through the Targeted Violence and Terrorism Protection grant program. DHS said 11 of those grants went to groups that work with underserved populations that can be targeted for attack, including two Historically Black Colleges and two groups that serve LGBTQ+ people. DHS added a new priority to the awards this year, which is to advance equity in awards and engage with underserved communities. In May, the Justice Department released a \"comprehensive environmental justice enforcement strategy\" aimed at advancing \"environmental justice in underserved communities that have been historically marginalized and overburdened, including low-income communities, communities of color, and Tribal and Indigenous communities.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP This week, the Department of Labor announced $80 million in grant funding to help fill the nation\u2019s nursing shortage in a way that advances equity and brings \"greater employment equity in underserved communities and improve health care workforce diversity.\" The Transportation Department this week marked the start of National Pedestrian Safety Month and reminded readers about the \"disparities in pedestrian safety and the importance of equity in road safety for all. Black and Native American pedestrians are disproportionately killed in the United States, as compared to white pedestrians.\"",

        " \n        By\n        Lawrence Richard   | Fox News ",
        " President Biden lashed out at a federal appeals court on Wednesday, after it ruled theDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) programwas illegally implemented by the Obama administration. In a statement, the president called the decision \"unlawful\" andurged Congressto make permanent legislative protections to help more than 600,000 immigrants currently protected by DACA. On Wednesday, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court\u2019s three-judge panel determined the Obama administration lacked the authority to institute the DACA program. However, the court stopped short of judicially dismantling it and said DACA migrants could continue to receive legal protections. \"I am disappointed in today's Fifth Circuit decision holding that DACA is unlawful. The court\u2019s stay provides a temporary reprieve for DACA recipients, but one thing remains clear: the lives of Dreamers remain in limbo,\" Biden said. FEDERAL APPEALS COURT RULES OBAMA-ERA DACA PROGRAM ILLEGAL, BUTS SAYS 600,000 ALREADY IN US CAN STAY \"Today\u2019s decision is the result of continued efforts byRepublican state officialsto strip DACA recipients of the protections and work authorization that many have now held for over a decade,\" the president added. \"And while we will use the tools we have to allow Dreamers to live and work in the only country they know as home,\" Biden continued, \"it is long past time for Congress to pass permanent protections for Dreamers, including a pathway to citizenship.\" BIDEN ADMIN MOVES TO STRENGTHEN OBAMA-ERA DACA PROGRAM AMID LEGAL CHALLENGES The circuit court also ruled the U.S. government could not process new applicants for DACA and ordered aTexas federal judgereview the program. \"A district court is in the best position to review the administrative record in the rulemaking proceeding and determine whether our holdings as to the 2012 DACA Memorandum fully resolve issues concerning the Final Rule,\" the court wrote. Biden specifically blamed \"MAGA-Republican officials\" for the court\u2019s decision as several Republican-led states sued the federal government over the DACA program. Governors allege the program negatively impacts their local economies as they have to foot the bill for DACA recipients\u2019 education and healthcare. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"My Administration is committed to defending Dreamers against attacks from Republican officials in Texas and other states,\"Biden concluded.\"This challenge to DACA is just another example of the extreme agenda being pushed by MAGA-Republican officials.\" The rule takes effect on October 31.

    "Records show one third of Fetterman's days as Lt. Gov. had empty schedule for more than 3 years: AP": [
        " \n        By\n        Ronn Blitzer   | Fox News ",
        " Democratic Pennsylvania Senate candidate John Fetterman has pointed to his work as the state's current lieutenant governor as he campaigns for a job in Washington, D.C., but an Associated Press review of his time in that position shows a noticeably light workload. The examination \u2013 which focused exclusively on the time prior to Fetterman's stroke in May 2022 \u2013 showed that for nearly one-third of his workdays, he had an empty schedule. \u00a0An AP report said that days that had activity in Fetterman's schedule showed that the lieutenant governor only had four to five hours of work in a typical day. Fetterman's campaign took issue with the AP's observation. \"This report is a misleading and inaccurate reflection of John\u2019s actual schedule that totally fails to capture the breadth of his official work and his accomplishments,\" spokesman Joe Calvello told the AP. FETTERMAN FAILED TO PRESIDE OVER PENNSYLVANIA SENATE 33% OF THE TIME, BUT ATTENDED EVERY PARDONS BOARD MEETING The AP reported that Fetterman's 2021 schedule showed 115 days with no listed events or other activities. From late June to mid-September of that year, the report said, his schedule was \"largely blank,\" showing only 11 hours of work accounted for. In 2022, prior to his stroke, Fetterman's schedule had 70 days with nothing on it. DEMOCRATS DEFEND FETTERMAN'S LACK OF PUBLIC APPEARANCES, DEBATES The main roles of the state's lieutenant governor include presiding over the state senate, chairing the Board of Pardons, and leading the governor's emergency management committee. Fox News Digital reported in September that Fetterman failed to preside over 33% of the state's Senate legislative sessions as lieutenant governor but holds a perfect attendance record with the Board of Pardons. Calvello pointed to the COVID-19 pandemic in addressing the absences to Fox News Digital. \"John takes his constitutional duty serving as president of the Pennsylvania Senate incredibly seriously,\" Calvello said. \"During the spring of 2020, beginning in March, much of the commonwealth, including John's home county of Allegheny, and Dauphin, the county where the state Capitol is located, were under restrictive red and yellow phases to stop the spread of COVID-19. After Allegheny County and Dauphin County\u00a0returned to green phase status on June 19, Fetterman returned to presiding.\" In 2019, Fetterman marked a near-perfect attendance for legislative sessions held by the Senate, presiding over 48 of the 51 sessions. However, in 2020, amid the spread of COVID-19, Fetterman only appeared for 50% of the Senate's legislative sessions, presiding over 26 of the 52 that were held. The following year, in 2021, Fetterman presided over 42 of the 59 legislative sessions held by the Senate, marking a 21% increase from the year prior. As for the Pennsylvania Board of Pardons, which is chaired by Fetterman, the lieutenant governor has had perfect attendance at the quarterly meetings even after his stroke. According to documents obtained through a public records request that were reviewed by Fox News Digital, Fetterman attended every Board of Pardons meeting from March 2019 through December 2021, and video shows him in the April and August meetings this year. Fetterman also attended the June meeting of the board, a source confirmed to Fox News Digital, though video was not available for that meeting. Fetterman is in a tight race against Republican candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz. \u00a0Oz campaign communications director Brittany Yanick responded to the AP report by claiming that Fetterman's records both as lieutenant governor and in his prior role as mayor of Braddock, Pa., were marked by poor attendance. Not showing up for work was No Show Fetterman's trademark as Lieutenant Governor AND as Mayor of Braddock. He couldn't be trusted to show up and work for the people of Braddock or the people of Pennsylvania,\" Yanick said in a statement. \"Pennsylvanians can't trust Fetterman to represent us in the U.S. Senate - his truly radical policies aside - after being absent from debates, in the media, and on the campaign trail for months. Clearly 'working' is not his thing, and he should go back to living off his parents.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The last remark is in line with recent attacks from Oz accusing Fetterman of relying on his parents' wealth. Fetterman\u2019s 2015 financial disclosure when he first ran for Senate showed that he collected just $1,800 a year as Braddock\u2019s mayor while living off $54,000 given to him by his parents. According to property records, he purchased his home in Braddock from his sister for just $1. Fetterman and Oz are set to square off in a debate on October 25, two weeks before the November 8 election. Fox News' Kyle Morris contributed to this report.",

        " \n        By\n        Houston Keene   | Fox News ",
        " FIRST ON FOX:Over 150 Republicans in the House of Representatives are calling on President Biden to reject California\u2019s newradical green car regulationsas the state looks to electrify its citizens\u2019 fleet. Rep. Bob Latta, R-Ohio., led the charge in a letter to Biden with nearly three-fourths of the entire House GOP urging the president to deny the State of California\u2019s Air Resource Board (CARB) Clean Air Act waiver request for new regulations requiring car sellers tophase out gas-powered engines. CARB\u2019s new regulations would require 35% of all car sales in the state to be electric vehicles by 2026 before completely phasing out internal combustion engines (ICEs) in new car sales by 2035. TWITTER RIPS GAVIN NEWSOM FOR POWER CONSERVATION PUSH AFTER ELECTRIC VEHICLE MANDATE: \u2018DESTROYING THE STATE\u2019 In order for the regulations to become enforceable, the Golden State needs a Clean Air Act preemption provisions waiver to give them the green light. House Republicans on the letter are calling on Biden to deny their waiver request. \"Earlier this year, America\u2019s energy regulators warned states about elevated risks to the reliability of our electric grid and the increased threat of brown and black outs,\" Latta said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"Instead of heeding those warnings, California politicians are pursuing stifling new regulations to ban gas- and diesel-powered cars by 2035,\" the congressman continued. \"This effort will extend far beyond California\u2019s borders and will make it more difficult for Americans to get to work, drop their kids off at school, and travel to visit loved ones.\" Latta said that one \"cannot forget, California recently alerted residents to substantially reduce their energy consumption, and now, they are contradicting themselves by forcing folks to become more reliant on the electric grid through the mandatory transition from traditional vehicles to electric-only vehicles.\" \"These actions are misguided and will further exacerbate the strain on our grid,\" Latta added. \"California\u2019s proposal is wrong; we must stand up now to preserve the reliability of our nation\u2019s electric grid and the rights of Americans to choose the vehicles they want to drive.\" Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Fla., one of the letter\u2019s co-leads, told Fox News Digital \"California\u2019s proposal is another example of liberal elitists being detached from the real constraints on the energy grid and the average American consumer.\" \"This summer we already saw California\u2019s energy grid struggle to meet growing energy demands, and these proposed regulations would only exacerbate that strain,\" Bilirakis said. \"With the higher-than-average cost of an EV vehicle, the average Californian might find themselves not only unable to afford a new EV vehicle, but even if they are, potentially unable to keep it reliably charged due to brown or black outs.\" GAVIN NEWSOM BLASTED FOR ASKING CALIFORNIANS TO AVOID CHARGING ELECTRIC VEHICLES DURING HEAT WAVE \"All Americans should have the freedom to choose which vehicle makes the most sense for their particular circumstances and budgets, and the EPA should not enable the Californian elite to set a precedent that could have negative impacts on all Americans,\" he added. Fellow co-lead Rep. John Joyce, R-Pa., warned \"California\u2019s discriminatory waiver request would set a costly and dangerous precedent.\" \"Americans should not be coerced into making purchases they cannot afford, and they should be free to drive the roads built with their tax dollars in the vehicles they otherwise would choose to drive,\" Joyce said. \"This heavy-handed proposal picks winners and losers, and I am proud to stand with my colleagues in urging the EPA to deny this outrageous request,\" he added. In the letter, the Republicans called on Biden to \"reject California\u2019s forthcoming request for this waiver due to widespread concerns for the negative impact it will have on the electric grid, the need for additional power generation, the overreliance on foreign adversaries for critical minerals, and the right of Americans to choose for themselves which vehicles they wish to drive.\" The lawmakers wrote it is \"disconcerting that California is attempting to ban ICE vehicles when there have already been real world examples showing California\u2019s grid will not be able to handle the increased electric load,\" pointing to the state government calling on residents tonot charge their electric vehiclesin the middle of a heat wave days after the policy announcement. \"This included a call to set thermostats higher and avoid plugging in major appliances. Under the new ban on ICE vehicles and with the goal of full electrification, California residents may face a future where they will be unable to get to work, shop for groceries at the local market, or pick up their kids from school because they will be unable to charge their vehicles when they want or need.\" \"These grid reliability concerns are so obvious that they cannot be ignored,\" Latta and the Republicans wrote, adding CARB\u2019s goal to have a fully-electric fleet on the road means \"the state would need to be able to generate enough electricity to continuously charge 30 million registered vehicles.\" \"If the state\u2019s electric grid is currently struggling to handle more demand for electricity, how will it be able to integrate the additional 2,250,000,000 kWhs it will need to charge its fleet (average 75 kWh electric vehicle battery)?\" the lawmakers asked. Outside of the physical limitations of the power grid, the lawmakers warned the new policy \"also fails to account for market realities\" and pointed to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics\u2019 numbers showing there are \"just under 276 million registered vehicles operating in the United States in 2020.\" Latta and his colleagues also wrote that, through April 2022, \"just over 2.3 million plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and battery electric vehicles (BEVs) have been sold cumulatively in the United States.\" \"If the United States did go to an all-EV fleet, as California would like, then where is the plan to convert, recycle, or dispose of the 276 million registered vehicles that are already on the road? How will California stifle the preferences of Americans that would like to purchase new ICE vehicles due to their accessibility, affordability, and reliable infrastructure? These questions need answers.\" The Republicans also raised concerns with the source of materials critical to the production of electric vehicles, such as lithium-ion batteries, of which \"China controls more than 70 percent of the world\u2019s\" production. They also wrote that \"it seems the loudest supporters of EVs are also the loudest critics of building up our nation\u2019s capacity to secure the materials right here at home.\" \"This will help shorten supply chains, which were exposed for their vulnerability during the COVID-19 pandemic, and reduce the United States\u2019 reliance on China, especially at a time when the latter is projecting military aggression in the South China Sea,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"Unless the intention is to make it more difficult for Americans to travel and commute, it would be simply impossible to phase out ICE vehicles without addressing these critical mineral concerns,\" they added. Latta and his colleagues argued their raised issues \"represent a small sample of the reasons why the EPA should reject California\u2019s request for a waiver of the CAA presumption provisions.\" \"Not only are there technical and logistical barriers, but also philosophical concerns with telling the American people what products they can and cannot buy,\" they concluded the letter. \"We urge you to consider these concerns and allow them to inform EPA\u2019s final decision on the waiver.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Joining Latta, Bilirakis and Joyce on the letter are 155 of their fellow House Republicans, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana, House GOP Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik of New York, and House Energy and Commerce ranking member Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington.

        " President Biden and Democratic lawmakers doubled down on the importance ofhostile actors boosting oil outputWednesday after a decision from a Saudi-led group to cut production. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the powerful Middle Eastern oil cartel, and its Russian counterpartannounced a massive production cutof 2 million barrels of oil per day, the largest reduction since the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020. In response, Democrats have unleashed their fury, noting the importance of oil production from the cartel comprised of dictators and hostile actors. \"The President is disappointed by the shortsighted decision by OPEC+ to cut production quotas while the global economy is dealing with the continued negative impact of Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine,\" the White House said in a statement Wednesday. \"At a time when maintaining a global supply of energy is of paramount importance, this decision will have the most negative impact on lower- and middle-income countries that are already reeling from elevated energy prices,\" the statement continued. RISING GAS PRICES FUEL SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS AS BIDEN ADMIN ASKS FOR VENEZUELA'S HELP: 'VERY FRUSTRATING' The White House also announced Biden would order the Department of Energy to unleash another 10 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The president has already drained 280 million barrels from the emergency stockpile, taking it to its lowest level since 1984. Democratic lawmakers urged Biden to turn back to Saudi Arabia and beg them again for more oil. Bidentraveled to the Middle Eastern nationin July to discuss oil production. AMERICANS SHOULD PREPARE FOR GAS PRICES TO KEEP RISING, ANALYSTS WARN \"There still is, in my view, an opportunity to persuade the Saudis that you're making a gigantic mistake here \u2014 and I hope the administration will be aggressive about it,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told Politico. \"We have an opportunity and an obligation to use the leverage available. We have agency here. And we should use it.\" \"We have to stop acting like the suckers in this relationship, and reestablish that the services we provide to these countries require them to take our legitimate interests and concerns into account,\" Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-N.J., told Politico. \"And if they're not willing to do that, then they should find another friend.\" And on Wednesday evening, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Biden administration was again looking to ease sanctions on Venezuela in exchange for more oil production. The White House reportedly engaged in oil negotiations with Venezuela in May. An agreement between the U.S. and Venezuela's government is expected by the end of October. BIDEN LOOKS EVERYWHERE TO LOWER GAS PRICES \u2014 EXCEPT BOOSTING OIL PRODUCTION \"Just in case you haven\u2019t noticed, our policy of sanctioning and isolating Maduro hasn\u2019t worked,\" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., tweeted Thursday. \"At some point when your policy isn\u2019t getting results, it\u2019s malpractice to not try something else.\" However, Republicans blasted Biden and Democrats for cozying up to dictators for energy and urged increased domestic production. \"You\u2019ve got to be kidding me. Instead of pumping out clean oil from our own states, the Biden Admin is now easing sanctions on communist Venezuela to get its dirty oil,\" Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., tweeted following the WSJ report. \"This Admin continues to place America last and embolden our adversaries.\" Earlier in the day, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., the top GOP member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, similarly slammed the Biden administration's energy policies which she said have led to increased reliance on foreign oil. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"President Biden\u2019s policies continue to drive the increases in gas prices that Americans will see after this production cut,\" she said in a statement. \"His war on American energy has allowed OPEC and Russia to regain control of the global oil market.\" \"Instead of flipping the switch for more American energy production and making us energy independent again, his administration has repeatedly chosen to beg authoritarian regimes, release strategic reserves for political expediency, and surrender our energy leadership for a rush-to-green agenda,\" she added. Meanwhile, the average price of gasoline nationwide increased to $3.87 a gallon on Thursday. Prices have been on the rise since mid-September and analysts have warned that consumers shouldn't expect relief anytime soon.",

    "Arizona Senate showdown: Democratic Sen. Kelly and GOP challenger Masters face-off in their only debate": [
        " \n        By\n        Paul Steinhauser   | Fox News ",
        " With just over a month to go untilNovember\u2019s midterm elections,Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Republican nominee Blake Masters will share the same stage Thursday evening in their only debate in a crucial battleground state race that\u2019s one of a handful which will likely determine if the GOP wins back the Senate majority. Kelly is a former astronaut who narrowly won election in 2020 to serve the final two years of the term of the late GOP Sen. John McCain, and Masters is a venture capitalist who\u2019s heavily supported byformer President Donald Trump. The two frontrunners will join Libertarian nominee Marc Victor for the debate, hosted by Arizona PBS and the Arizona Citizens Clean Elections Commission. Kelly has crushed Masters when it comes to fundraising and currently holds a 3.9 point advantage over his Republican challenger according to an average of the most recent public opinion polls compiled by Real Clear Politics. The most recent Fox News poll in the state, conducted Sept. 22-26, indicated Kelly with a six-point lead over Masters. Masters in August captured the GOP Senate nomination in a crowded and combustible primary, thanks to the support of Trump. Masters strongly backed Trump's unproven claims that his 2020 election loss to President Biden was due to massive voter fraud. Arizona was one of the key swing states where Biden narrowly edged Trump two years ago. Also boosting Masters was the more than $15 million that his former boss, tech billionaire and PayPal founder Peter Thiel, poured into a super PAC backing Masters\u2019 primary campaign. WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL IN BATTLEGROUND ARIZONA SHOWS The race in Arizonais one of the most expensive in the nation, with the campaigns, party committees, and allied outside groups dishing out over $120 million on ads so far this election cycle. Chuck Coughlin, veteran Arizona based political consultant, told Fox News that Masters clearly has the most to gain from the debate. THESE 11 SENATE RACES WILL DETERMINE WHICH PARTY CONTROLS THE MAJORITY \"It\u2019s a one-on-one opportunity with the incumbent U.S. Senator. Masters hasn\u2019t had that before and there\u2019s a need for him to put some runners on base,\" Coughlin said. \"Kelly\u2019s campaign has been disciplined. It\u2019s been running the narrative that it wants to run and I think that Masters has been responding to the narrative rather than leading his own. It will be an opportunity for Masters to potentially try and turn the tables and put Kelly on the defensive for the first time.\" Coughlin said he expects Masters to go on the offensive on border security and immigration, which he said \"are the biggest issues in Arizona,\" and inflation. \"Arizona has some of the worst inflation in the country,\" he added. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And Coughlin noted he expects Kelly to argue \"how can you believe what [Masters] says\" after the GOP nominee has softened his position on banning abortion and on his support for Trump\u2019s repeated re-litigation of the 2020 election. He also expects the senator to spotlight Masters comments criticizing America\u2019s armed forces.",

        " \n        By\n        Deirdre A. Reilly   | Fox News ",
        " Dale Klonin, a firefighter at Baltimore/Washington International Airportin Baltimore, was off duty and busy running errands last Wednesday when he stumbled upon a chance to save lives. Klonin, 46, lives in Hampstead, Maryland. As an amateur ham radio operator with an interest in \"any news or weather event,\" he was keeping an eye and ear onHurricane Ian. \"Of course, the hurricane was pretty big news,\" Klonin told Fox News Digital in a phone interview. HURRICANE IAN IN FLORIDA SPURS FRANTIC MESSAGES ABOUT MISSING LOVED ONES AND WRECKED HOMES Thinking aboutfamily memberswho live outside Sarasota, Florida, Klonin and his wife \"were pretty concerned\" about the storm, he said. Klonin has only been involved with ham radio \u2014 also called amateur radio \u2014 for about a year, he said. Ham radio is a popular hobby and service that people all over the world use \"to talk across town, around the world or even into space, all without the Internet or cell phones,\" according to The American Radio Relay League website. \"It's fun, social, educational and can be a lifeline during times of need,\" they note. Klonin was tuned into several networks, or \"nets,\" on his ham radio system that morning. \"I had the Florida Emergency and the National Hurricane Center Emergency nets monitored,\" he said. \"A net is basically a frequency,\" he said. \"A bunch of people are just listening in to see if there's anything going on, and one person acts as a controller. Every 10 minutes, someone comes on, and they're asking for emergency messages, damage reports and that kind of thing.\" HURRICANE IAN VICTIMS AND THOSE STILL IN ITS PATH RECEIVE BLESSINGS, PRAYERS AND HELP Klonin said that after monitoring the nets for most of the morning, he and his wife went to drop off her car for a tune-up at their regular shop in Hanover, Pennylvania, about 20 minutes away from his home. That afternoon, hewent to retrieve the car. As Klonin was settling the bill, he and Aly Ruiz, a service adviser, made small talk, he said. \"I said something like, \u2018How about this hurricane?\u2019\" he said. HURRICANE IAN DISASTER RELIEF: WAYS TO DONATE AS THE DEATH TOLL MOUNTS Ruiz shared with Klonin that her sister Kelsey, as well as Kelsey's boyfriend, were on Sanibel Island. \"And she said, 'I haven't heard from her in four hours,\u2019\" Klonin said. \"She showed me pictures [from their texts] \u2014 Kelsey\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s truck was completely submerged,\" said Klonin, adding that other photos revealed the floodwaters were coming up to the second floor of Kelsey\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s home. Klonin said that Ruiz told him,\"My sister is really stubborn. She wasn't taking this whole thing seriously. I'm really worried about her.\" Klonin said he answered, \"You know what? I'm an amateur radio operator. I've been listening to these networks all morning. Some of the emergency operation centers are listening. Let me try and get a message through, or at least let them know that these people might need help.\" Ruiz readily supplied all pertinent numbers for the stranded group, Klonin said, including the number for their Garmin inReach, a satellite communicator. \"I initially just thought, 'If something bad were to happen or even something good, you know, if someone picks them up, they would know that they were being looked for and get back in touch with us [through ham radio communication],\" Ruiz told Fox News Digital in a phone interview. FLORIDA WEATHER BLOGGER TALKS HURRICANE IAN AND HOW STORMS UNITE PEOPLE: \u2018NEIGHBORS HELPING NEIGHBORS\u2019 \"But it was a much bigger deal,\" she continued. \"He [Klonin] was in contact with people. I don't think I realized how much he could really help in this situation.\" Klonin, who has an inReach himself for hiking trips, said he uses his when cell phone communication may not be possible. \"Hardly anybody I know has one,\" said Klonin, marveling that the group on Sanibel Island did have one. Klonin began his 20-minute drive home \u2014 and during the ride Ruiz texted him, saying her sister had reached out via the inReach. They were \"safe, but stranded,\" explained Klonin. \"Aly texted me again saying, \u2018By the way, there's eight other people there [in their group on Sanibel] and a dog,'\" Klonin said. \"I've been a firefighter for 20 some years, and I teach emergency preparedness,\" said Klonin. \"And I said, \u2018Aly, I don't think they know how much danger there really is.\u2019\" Asking for a \"better idea of where they are,\"andknowing that the inReach could supply critical location coordinates, Klonin said he knew his job was not over. \"So, she sent me those, I get on the radio and I call out to the Florida emergency net \u2014 and that controller comes back and acknowledges me,\" he said. HURRICANE IAN SLAMS FLORIDA AS SCHOOLS ACT AS SHELTERS: \u2018READY TO ACCEPT ANYONE WITH OPEN ARMS,\u2019 TEACHER SAYS \"And I said, \u2018Hey, I have someone here in Maryland, and they are receiving messages from their loved ones on Sanibel Island \u2014 the island is destroyed, their house is battered, and it's flooding. They may need possible rescue,\u2019\" Klonin continued. The Florida emergency net took all the information, said Klonin, and they in turn \"brought up another station who took all the information, too,\u2019\" he added. He continued, \"Florida State Emergency Operation Center called back and asked for more information\" \u2014 and Klonin was soon emailing all the needed information over to them. \"Before I was even done talking on the radio, the authorities knew exactly where they were,\" he said. \"We continued offline, and I sent screenshots of all the text messages, and then Aly texted me.\" He continued, \"She said, \u2018They're OK. The authorities are texting with them.\u2019\" Klonin said people should know that ham radio operators are out there listening \u2014 and that they care. FLORIDA WIFE OF VETERAN, THEIR HOME WITHOUT POWER DUE TO HURRICANE IAN, SAYS \u2018AMERICA WILL REBUILD\u2019 \"You know, ham radio operators do so much behind the scenes, and they never get any credit,\" he said. \"How do you think the Cajun Navy gets their locations, in order to rescue people? Often, it is someone communicating on a ham radio.\" He added, \"Usually the ham radio operators after a disaster are the ones that are getting in there and, through their networks, getting all the information until the authorities can get there. They do this out of the kindness of their hearts,\" he said. Ruiz said that before she knew her sister was safe, the situation had her \"wildly upset and scared.\" She said, \"I think that Dale could feel that, with him being a paramedic and a firefighter for so long \u2014 and he just turned to action.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER She added, \"I didn't ask him to do any of that.

        " \n        By\n        Kristine Parks   | Fox News ",
        " Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., defended the progressive push to \"defund the police\" Wednesday on CNN, after hostDon Lemonquestioned if the slogan hurt Democrats. The CNN host first brought up the \"strong backlash\" to defunding the police affecting November's midterm elections before asking the congresswoman if she still stood by the controversial platform. \"As you know, there\u2019s a pretty strong backlash to things like defund the police. I know you\u2019ve been getting a lot of questions about this. For example, did defund the police \u2014 did progressives go too far in hurting Democratic chances in the far with \u2014 in the fall, with slogans like \u2018defund the police?\u2019\" he posed. But Bush disagreed that the phrase damaged Democrats politically. \"[T]here is no data that actually shows that saying 'defund the police' cost actual elections,\" she began, saying how candidates campaigned and used \"digital technology,\" was to blame for lost seats. TOP DEMOCRAT RIPPED FOR CLAIMING LEADING DEMS DON'T SUPPORT DEFUNDING POLICE When pressed, she didn't hesitate to support the movement again. \"If you could do it again, would you still double down or use that slogan, \u2018defund the police?\u2019\" Lemon asked. \"Absolutely,\" the Democrat responded. But some Democrats like Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., have pinned blame on the controversial slogan for his party losing congressional seats in the 2020 election. \"That phrase, 'defund the police,'cost [Democratic Senate candidate] Jaime Harrison tremendously,\" he told Axios, shortly after the election. \"Stop sloganeering.

        " Three House Democrats are introducing a bill to remove U.S. defense systems from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in response to the OPEC+ decision to cut oil production by 2 million barrels per day \u2013 a move that is expected to drive upgas pricesin the U.S. Reps. Tom Molinowski, D-N.J., Sean Casten, D-Ill., and Susan Wild, D-Pa., called outSaudi Arabiaand the UAE \u2013 both OPEC members \u2013 after President Biden had tried to work with them. The House members said the U.S. needs to reevaluate its relationship with both nations. \"Saudi Arabia and the UAE\u2019s drastic cut in oil production, despite President Biden\u2019s overtures to both countries in recent months, is a hostile act against the United States and a clear signal that they have chosen to side with Russia in its war against Ukraine,\" the three Democrats said in a joint statement. \"Both countries have long relied on an American military presence in the Gulf to protect their security and oil fields. We see no reason why American troops and contractors should continue to provide this service to countries that are actively working against us. If Saudi Arabia and the UAE want to help Putin, they should look to him for their defense.\" The House members went on to callOPEC\u2019s decision\"a turning point in our relationship with our Gulf partners\" and said that if the UAE and Saudi Arabia want to continue having a relationship with the U.S., they need to work with the U.S. \"in advancing what is now our most urgent national security objective: the defeat of Russia's aggression in Ukraine.\" They claimed that \"by significantly boosting global oil prices, OPEC\u2019s decision appears designed to increase Russia\u2019s oil export revenues, enabling Putin to continue his war crimes in Ukraine, and undercutting Western sanctions.\" OPEC OIL CUTS MEAN HIGHER GAS PRICES: KEVIN BOOK Their bill, the \"Strained Partnership Act,\" takes its name and virtually all of its language from a 2020 bill sponsored by Republican Sens. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., and Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska. Both bills call for the removal of \"[a]ll\u00a0United States Armed Forces and equipment, including Patriot missile batteries and the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system\" from Saudia Arabia within 90 days of the bill\u2019s enactment. The only difference between the two bills is the new one from the Democrats says the defenses should also be removed from the United Arab Emirates. OPEC CUTS ARE \u2018REALLY BAD NEWS\u2019 FOR AMERICAN CONSUMERS, SAYS API PRESIDENT The bill, like its predecessor, says that the removed missile batteries and THAAD system should be \"to the extent practicable, be relocated to another location or locations in\u00a0the Middle East, with the priority mission of protecting United States Armed Forces.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP American Petroleum Institute President Mike Sommers called the OPEC cut \"really bad news for American consumers\" in a Wednesday appearance on \"America's Newsroom.\" Sommers blamed theBiden administrationfor having the U.S. rely on foreign oil, saying it \"was a choice\" for the U.S. to be \"about a million barrels of production down from where we were in 2019.\"",

        " A federal appeals court determined that the Obama administration didn't have the authority to institute the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program but declined to dismantle it, allowing more than 600,000 immigrants to continue to enjoy its protections. The 5th U.S. Circuit ordered a review of new changes by theBiden administrationto DACA, telling aTexas federal judgeto review the program. A three judge panel from the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also ruled that while the Obama administration lacked the authority to create the immigration policy which affects over 600,000 people, it didn't dismantle the program, and people can continue benefiting from the policy. The panel ruled that the U.S. government cannot process new applicants for individuals seeking DACA benefits. BIDEN ADMIN MOVES TO STRENGTHEN OBAMA-ERA DACA PROGRAM AMID LEGAL CHALLENGES \"A district court is in the best position to review the administrative record in the rulemaking proceeding and determine whether our holdings as to the 2012 DACA Memorandum fully resolve issues concerning the Final Rule,\" the opinion states.

The rule would begin on Oct. 31. In July 2021, U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen ruled that DACA was illegal and said that it wasn't put through public notice and comment, which is a requirement by the federal Administrative Procedures Act.

    "Democratic candidate running in toss-up race called to end oil and gas 'immediately,' said 'shut it all down'": [
        " \n        By\n        Thomas Phippen   | Fox News ",
        " FIRST ON FOX:A Democratic candidate for Congress fromNew Mexicois looking to walk back recently unearthed comments he previously made indicating he supported ending oil and gas extraction \"immediately.\" Gabe Vasquez, a former city council member of Las Cruces, New Mexico, said in 2018 he agreed with environmentalists who sought to get rid of oil and gas extraction \"immediately\" in favor of renewable energy. As the Novembermidterm electionsapproach, Vasquez has recently called the oil and gas industry \"incredibly important to this district\" not just for the extraction companies themselves, but for the small businesses that support the fossil fuel industry. Vasquez, who is running against incumbent Republican Rep. Yvette Herrell in the 2nd Congressional District that covers most of the southern half of New Mexico, said on his \"Nuestra Tierra Conservation Podcast\" several years ago that he agreed with environmental groups who say, \"Shut it all down. Let's just get rid of it immediately.\" PELOSI-BACKED CANDIDATE WHO ATTACKED US AS 'AMERIKKKA' AND CALLED TO 'DECONSTRUCT' POLICE WINS DEM PRIMARY However, he also criticized some in the environmental movement who ignored local communities' reliance on oil and gas industries for their survival. \"In the very statement referenced, I make absolutely clear that my top priority is protecting the livelihoods of New Mexicans and that I will not support any transition to sustainable energy that leaves working people who rely on the oil and gas industry behind,\" Vasquez told Fox News Digital on Wednesday in a statement. \"We can continue to produce oil and gas responsibly, protect the health of our workers and our environment, and add even more jobs in the southeast by expanding our renewable energy production.\" The podcast is no longer available on iTunes, but audio of the episode shared with Fox News matches an episode archived on Backtracks.fm, a podcast analytics website. In it, Vasquez does not appear to indicate that oil and gas should continue to be produced responsibly, but he indicates thatfossil fuel extractionshould be ended in a way that supports local economies in the transition. \"A lot of folks in the environmental community will say, 'Shut it all down. Let\u2019s just get rid of it immediately, let\u2019s put in the infrastructure to get clean energy.\u2019 And I agree with that. Because, as a planet, we need to move in that direction,\" Vasquez said in one episode of the podcast that aired March 27, 2018. Vasquez went on to say that a shift away from fossil fuels would need heavy infrastructure buildup in renewable energy sources to ensure communities that rely on current extraction industries would have opportunities for employment. \"We also have to figure out a way to make sure that our people in these small towns and in these economies have an opportunity for job retraining, have an opportunity to be the ones installing those windmills or manufacturing those solar panels. And that's, I think, some of the thing that gets lost on some of the larger environmental community,\" he said. BIDEN CONTRADICTS HIS OWN TOP HURRICANE EXPERT TO PUSH CLIMATE AGENDA Later in the podcast, Vasquez agreed with his guest, New Mexico state Rep. Angelica Rubio, and otherenvironmental groups,saying, \"We do have to end it all,\" referring to fossil fuel-based energy. He also bemoaned how entrenched oil and gas production was in the state's economy. \"I think this is where I get really frustrated with our legislature and with just the state of the world in terms of our politics here in New Mexico is because oil and gas is such a big part of our way of thinking. And our way of thinking is that we\u2019ve also become very short-sighted in terms of our vision and how we think about things and moving forward in terms of economic development,\" Vasquez said. The New Mexico Oil and Gas Association says the industry supported 134,000 jobs in the state in 2021. Vasquez said in August that, if elected, he would be a voice for oil and gas workers in New Mexico, rather than support corporate extraction industries. \"My approach is that we can\u2019t line the pockets of the corporations and the CEOs at the expense of the health of the communities,\" he said, according to the Carlsbad Current-Argus. \"In Congress, I do want to hold the oil and gas companies accountable for not making some of the investments I believe they should be making in reducing methane emissions.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Herrell, Vasquez's opponent in the race, saidthe economy is not readyto give up all fossil fuels, given all the industries it supports. \"We all take for granted the fossil fuel industry, the products that come out of that space,\" Herrell said. \"Let\u2019s get our energy from where it's cleaner and better for the environment. We\u2019re not ready to go all green.\"",

        " \n        By\n        Haris Alic   | Fox News ",
        " The sudden decision to cut out more than 700,000 borrowers fromPresident Biden's $400 billion student loanhandout could make it harder for opponents of that policy to challenge it in court, and some say the change appears to have been made precisely for that reason. Soon after Biden's policy was announced, officials saidloan forgiveness would only apply to borrowerswho consolidated their debts under the Department of Education. That last-minute change\u00a0made more than 700,000 borrowers ineligible for the handout because their loans are still managed by private companies. Just before that change was announced, Nebraska and five other states filed a lawsuit arguing that their finances would be adversely hit by the handout. These states argued they had standing to sue because millions of dollars in public pension funds are invested in private companies that manage many of these student loans, and that Biden's program would hurt these companies and lead to lower returns. Legal experts told Fox News Digital that by making loans managed by these companies ineligible for forgiveness, the Biden administration may have stripped the six states of any standing in court, and likely helped the policy survive an early court challenge. WHITE HOUSE SUGGESTS BIDEN'S $500B STUDENT LOAN HANDOUT WILL BE PAID FOR WITH DEFICIT SPENDING \"By getting rid of the privately-backed loans, they probablycut off the right to suefrom certain investors, financial institutions, and state governments who could argue they would be negatively impacted by the proposal,\" said Jack Fitzhenry, a legal policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation. \"This makes it a lot harder for states and companies managing the privately-held debt to sue over lost revenue,\" said Fitzhenry. Policy experts said this is not the first time the White House has revised the parameters of the handout in response to legal attacks. One of the first legal challenges filed against the handout was from a borrower who would have to pay taxes on the handout because their state of residence considers debt cancelation as income. STATE AGS WEIGH LEGAL CHALLENGE TO BIDEN'S $500B STUDENT LOAN HANDOUT \"When that lawsuit was filed, there was no indication that borrowers could opt out on the official website set up to provide information,\" said Beth Akers, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. \"After the lawsuit, the website was updated to say you could opt out and that might be enough to nix the lawsuit.\" The White House has revised the handout proposal several times since Biden first announced in August plans to forgive up to $10,000 for borrowers making less than $125,000 annually, and up to $20,000 for people in families earning less than $250,000. The revisions have been heavily criticized by policy experts, some of whom have argued the administration seemed unprepared to roll out the program. Now some say that maybe the White House's tactics are more strategic than first appear.

        " \n        By\n        Thomas Catenacci   | Fox News ",
        " President Joe Biden used part of his remarks in Florida on Wednesday toblame Hurricane Ian, a recent Category 4 storm, on human-caused climate change despite recent pushback from experts. \"We're in a situation where the Colorado River looks more like a stream,\" Biden said during a speech in Fort Myers, Florida, on Wednesday afternoon. \"There's a lot going on, and I think the one thing this has finally ended is a discussion about whether or not there's climate change, and we should do something about it.\" Biden visited Fort Myers alongside Gov. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., and Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Rick Scott, R-Fla., to survey Hurricane Ian's damage and reaffirm the federal government's commitment to assist with the state's recovery efforts. Last week, the stormpummeled Florida's west coast, causing more than 100 deaths and over a million residents to lose power. As the storm struck Florida, though, several Democrats, left-wing commentators and media outlets claimed its existence and intensity was a result of carbon emissions and global warming. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., even appeared to suggest that voting for Democrats would help avoid future hurricanes. DEMOCRATS BLAMING CLIMATE CHANGE FOR HURRICANE IAN AT ODDS WITH SCIENCE, EXPERTS SAY However, experts, including theBiden administration's top hurricane expert, have since pushed back against such claims, saying there wasn't enough evidence to tie the storm to climate change. \"We can come back and talk about climate change at a later time. I want to focus on the here and now. We think the rapid intensification is probably almost done,\" Jamie Rhome, the acting director of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Hurricane Center, told CNN in an interview on Sept. 27. BIDEN SUGGESTS AMERICANS NOT PROUD OF US IN DIVISIVE FUNDRAISER SPEECH AS FLORIDA PUMMELED BY HURRICANE IAN AfterCNN anchor Don Lemonreiterated a question about the hurricane being linked to climate change, Rhome again pushed back. \"I don\u2019t think you can link climate change to any one event. On the whole, on the cumulative, climate change may be making storms worse,\" he continued. \"But to link it to any one event, I would caution against that.\" A recent NOAA study similarly concluded that it was \"premature to conclude with high confidence\" that human-caused increasing greenhouse gases have had any impact on hurricane activity in the Atlantic. And on Sunday, Michael Shellenberger, an energy policy expert and founder of the group Environmental Progress,tweeted a seriesof NOAA analyses showing there is no definitive long-term trend in hurricane frequency, there may be a negative trend in land-falling hurricanes since 1900, and there is no long-term trend on increasing hurricane intensity.

    "Herschel Walker hauls in $12 million the past three months in Georgia showdown with Democratic Sen. Warnock": [
        " \n        By\n        Paul Steinhauser   | Fox News ",
        " EXCLUSIVE:Republican Senate nominee Herschel Walkerbrought in $12 million during the July through September third quarter of 2022 fundraising, as he challenges Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia in a race that\u2019s among a handful across the country that will likely determine if the GOP wins back the Senate majority in November\u2019s midterm elections. While the fundraising figure, which was shared first with Fox News on Wednesday, was less than half of Warnock's haul during the same period, it's nearly double the $6.2 million Walker brought in during the April-June second quarter of fundraising. And it\u2019s the former college and professional football star\u2019s biggest quarterly figure since hedeclared his candidacy in Georgiain August of last year. Walker\u2019s campaign noted that it\u2019s the largest amount raised in the third quarter by any of the Republican challengers in this year\u2019s Senate races. And they also announced that they received contributions from \"tens of thousands of donors\" and had $7 million cash on hand as of the end of last month. \"My team and I have traveled to every corner of Georgia, and everywhere we go people have made it clear that Raphael Warnock has sided with Joe Biden and left them behind,\"\u00a0Walker emphasized in a statement.\u00a0\"The people are so fired up for a new warrior in Washington that they have literally put their money where their mouths are.\" WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL IN GEORGIA'S SENATE RACE SHOWS And Walker campaign manager Scott Paradise highlighted that \"we are raising more money than ever and have the resources needed to get our message out. Herschel Walker will win.\" But Walker\u2019s fundraising, while impressive, pales in comparison to the massive $26.3 million Warnock hauled in during the third quarter. Warnock\u2019s campaign, in reporting theirfundraising figureson Monday, said that they ended September with $13.7 million in their coffers. Warnock's cash on hand was nearly double what Walker has in his campaign coffers. HERSCHEL WALKER DENIES BOMBSHELL REPORT HE PAID FOR GIRLFRIEND'S ABORTION Warnock, the senior pastor at Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church where Martin Luther King Jr. used to preach, narrowly defeated GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler one of Georgia\u2019s twin Jan. 5, 2021, Senate runoff elections. Republicans view him as vulnerable as he seeks a full six-year term representing the battleground statein the Senate. While Warnock and allied Democratic groups outspent Walker and GOP aligned groups in the ads wars during the summer, the race remains close. An average of the latest public opinion polls in the showdown compiled by Real Clear Politics indicates the senator holding a 3.8 point advantage over the GOP challenger. And the latest Fox News poll in Georgia, conducted Sept. 22-26, indicated Warnock with a four-point edge over Walker. His campaign\u2019s release of his fundraising figures comes as Walker continues to deny a bombshell report that posted on Monday that he paid for a girlfriend\u2019s abortion 13 years ago. The Daily Beast reported that Walker in 2009 urged an unnamed former girlfriend to get an abortion after she became pregnant while they were dating, and that he reimbursed her $700 for the procedure. The report cited interviews with a woman who said she had a bank receipt showing Walker\u2019s alleged payment, and a \"get well\" card that he reportedly sent her. The report said the woman provided proof of her intimate relationship with Walker, and that they corroborated details in the woman\u2019s story with a close friend who said she took care of her in days following the alleged abortion. Fox News has not verified the reporting. ONLY ON FOX NEWS DIGITAL: WALKER HIGHLIGHTS HIS INDEPENDENCE FROM TRUMP Walker \u2014 who is a vocal opponent of abortion and supports a proposed 15-week federal ban against the procedure \u2014 in an interview Monday night on Fox News\u2019 \"Hannity,\" called the allegations \"a flat-out lie.\" And he pointed fingers at Democrats, arguing in an interview Wednesday morning on Fox News\u2019 \"Fox and Friends\" that \"it just shows how desperate they are night now. They see me as a big threat.\" Walker\u2019s campaign tells Fox News that they raised roughly half a million dollars in the 36 hours after The Daily Beast story went viral. And Republican groups quickly rallied around Walker and discounted The Daily Beast story. Walker, who won a Heisman Trophy and helped steer the\u00a0University of Georgia\u00a0to a college football national championship four decades ago, jumped into the GOP race to face off against Warnock after months of support and encouragement to run for the Senate byformer President Donald Trump,his longtime friend. Thanks to his legendary status among many in Georgia and his immense, favorable, name recognition in the Peach State, Walker instantly became the overwhelming front-runner for the GOP Senate nomination and basically ignored the field of lesser-known primary rivals, declining to take part in debates as he focused his campaign on Warnock.\u00a0Walker ended up trouncing his rivals in the May primary, but he quickly came under fire as the general election got underway. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Walker has been heavily criticized both on the campaign trail and in ads over what Democrats call his numerous \"bizarre or false statements.\" A TV ad by Warnock\u2019s campaign that launched over the summer highlighted past comments by Walker saying that he had a \"dry mist\" that would \"kill any COVID on your body.\" Walker has also taken incoming fire over numerous reports that he overinflated the success of his businesses and academic record and was forced to play defense regarding a number of personal controversies \u2014 from the allegations of past abuse and threats against his first wife, to acknowledging children he fathered out of wedlock that he had not previously publicly mentioned despite for decades criticizing absent fathers.",

    "Voters trust John Fetterman over Dr. Oz on the economy, crime and immigration: poll": [
        " \n        By\n        Aubrie Spady   | Fox News ",
        " In Pennsylvania, where Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman is in a heated matchup against GOP nominee Dr. Mehmet Oz in the battle for the state's open Senate seat, a new poll suggests that voters prefer the Democratic candidate on critical issues, despite the majority of respondents having an unfavorable opinion of DemocratPresident Biden. A new Monmouth University survey among voters in Pennsylvania found that despite Biden's underwater approval rating, the majority of voters trust Fetterman over Oz to best handle every issue of top concern, including abortion,the economy, crime and immigration. \"The economy is an issue that has generally helped Republicans in national polling, but Oz has not been able to capitalize on it,\" said Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute. Just 36% of respondents said they trusted Oz best on jobs, the economy and cost-of-living issues, compared to 45% who said the same of Fetterman. The poll showed an increase in the share who trusted Fetterman on the economy from 41% in Monmouth's September poll, while the percentage who trusted Oz more remained steady. FETTERMAN CAST LONE VOTE IN FAILED BID TO FREE MAN CONVICTED IN FIRST-DEGREE MURDER OF HIGH SCHOOLER According to the poll, 55% of respondents have an unfavorable opinion of Biden, including the majority of likely independent voters, 66%, who have an unfavorable view of the president. Economy, jobs and the cost of living were either very or extremely important to 87% of Pennsylvanians. The issue was of top concern to 45% of likely Republican voters, 38% of independents and 34% of Democrats. Abortion was the issue of top concern to 44% of Democratic voters going into the midterms, ranking over inflation on their list of priorities. Among independent respondents in the Pennsylvania poll, only 21% felt that abortion was the most concerning issue facing the state, and 26% of Republicans said they were focused on the issue. Forty-eight percent said they trusted Fetterman more on the issue, compared to 29% who trusted Oz. NEW POLL IN BATTLEGROUND PENNSYLVANIA'S SENATE RACE INDICATES FETTERMAN UP BY 6 POINTS OVER OZ The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June and declared that the Constitution does not confer the right to an abortion, returning the power to the states to place restrictions on abortion. Since the ruling, Democrats have used theissue of abortionto drive their campaigns, spending approximately $124 million campaigning on the topic this cycle. A new light has been shined on the border crisis after GOP governors received backlash for sending illegal migrants to Democrat-run \"sanctuary cities.\" The new poll found that immigration is either very or extremely important to 63% of registered voters in Pennsylvania. In Monmouth's September poll, voters were split on whether they trusted Fetterman or Oz more to handle immigration, with both candidates getting 34%. In the latest poll, 41% said Fetterman would be better on immigration, compared to 37% who said the same of Oz. On crime, 45% said they trusted Fetterman, compared to 38% who trusted Oz more. Fetterman is leading thePennsylvania Senate racewith 48% support over Dr. Mehmet Oz's 43% support. However, the poll shows the race tightening as Oz's support marks a boost of 4 percentage points compared to a Monmouth poll conducted three weeks ago. \"We asked probable supporters of both candidates why they are not certain about their choice. In most cases, these voters say they simply don\u2019t know enough about general issue stances to fully commit to that candidate yet. However, a number of probable Oz voters in the poll did mention concerns about both his residency status and his conservative bona fides. Few specific reasons emerge in describing reluctance to support the Democrat, but it is worth noting that only one probable Fetterman voter in the poll mentioned health concerns as a reason they might not support him,\" said Murray. Concerns have been raised in recent months over Fetterman's health, following his recovery from a stroke in May that appeared to affect his auditory processing ability. Democrats are leading over Republicans on the generic congressional ballot by one percentage point, 42% to 41%. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP TheMonmouth University pollwas conducted from Sept. 29-Oct. 3. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.8 percentage points.",

    "As GOP rallies behind Herschel Walker, backers say abortion allegation doesn\u2019t matter": [
        " \n        By\n        Howard Kurtz   | Fox News ",
        " Character doesn't count. That\u2019s the only conclusion to be drawn fromtoday\u2019s cutthroat politics. The statement seems perplexing on its face. Of course character must count! Don\u2019t all candidates, at every level, try to convince voters that they are people of integrity who share their values? Now that matters a whole lot less than it did a decade ago. Now what matters is winning, period. MIDTERM ATTACKS: HERSCHEL WALKER HIT ON ABORTION PAYMENT REPORT, DR. OZ ON ALLEGED QUACKERY Both sides are so convinced that the country would be doomed if the other side seizes or maintains power that everything hinges on victory. If that means ignoring, minimizing or rationalizing their nominee\u2019s manifest flaws, so be it. I\u2019m talking here about the Herschel Walker accusations, but the roots of this mentality go back decades. Americans elected Bill Clinton despite knowing about his draft avoidance and Gennifer Flowers affair allegation (which he lied about). And whilemany Democrats criticizedhis personal conduct with Monica Lewinsky (which he also lied about), they said he shouldn\u2019t be impeached \u2013 and Clinton emerged fairly popular. George W. Bush ran as someone who had beaten alcohol abuse at age 40 \u2013 and a final-weekend disclosure of a DWI didn\u2019t stop him from taking the White House. And then there was Donald Trump,who won the presidencyalthough everyone knew he\u2019d had affairs during earlier marriages, beyond a slew of new allegations from women, and whose \"grab \u2019em\" talk was revealed by the \"Access Hollywood\" tape. So Americans don\u2019t expect their politicians to be perfect. Uh, Anthony Weiner somehow thought it was a good idea to run for mayor after his sexting scandal, and Eliot Spitzer ran for New York City comptroller after resigning as governor for patronizing prostitutes. Both Democrats got clobbered. But Republican Mark Sanford won a congressional seat in South Carolina after \"hiking the Appalachian trail\" as governor (to cover an affair with an Argentinian woman) and fending off an impeachment attempt. And Democrat Gavin Newsom won the California governorship years after acknowledging an affair with a staffer who was the wife of his close friend and campaign manager. TRUMP, MCCONNELL, EXTREME INSULTS AND A CLIMATE VIOLENCE Most paid a price. Back in 2012,Missouri GOP congressmanTodd Akin, running for the Senate, was asked about abortion and rape. \"If it\u2019s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down,\" he said. There was a national uproar, and the comment sunk Akin\u2019s candidacy. In the case ofGeorgia Senate nomineeHerschel Walker, his denial of a Daily Beast report that he paid for a girlfriend\u2019s abortion more than a decade ago is not terribly convincing. While Walker, who wantsa total ban on abortion,calls the allegation a \"flat-out lie,\" the Beast has a copy of his $700 check to the unnamed accuser, a get well card from him and the woman\u2019s $575 receipt from an abortion clinic. Asked about the check by Fox\u2019s Sean Hannity, the former football star said: \"I send money to a lot of people\u2026 I believe in being generous.\" Walker, who has admitted to severe mental health problems and had not acknowledged several of his children, now faces fierce criticism from his son Christian. The 23 year old accuses him of lying, not raising his children and making violent threats against the family \u2013 echoing allegations from his mother. But the Republican Party has largely closed ranks behind Walker. Trump declared that \"Herschel Walker is being slandered and maligned by the Fake News Media and obviously, the Democrats.\" Without addressing any specifics,Trump said he has\"no doubt\" of Walker\u2019s denial, adding: \"They are trying to destroy a man who has true greatness in his future, just as he had athletic greatness in his past.\" Conservative radio host Dana Loesch said on her podcast that she doesn\u2019t care about the abortion payment allegation: \"I want control of the Senate. If the Daily Beast story is true, you're telling me Walker used his money to reportedly pay some skank for an abortion? And Warnock wants to use all of our monies to pay a whole bunch of skanks for abortions.\" SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF ON THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES ConservativeWashington Post columnist Henry Olsensaid the allegation \"won\u2019t faze Republicans\u2026 The choice between Warnock and Walker isn\u2019t a hard one for Republicans or pro-lifers. Warnock is a solidly progressive Democrat who has largely backed his party\u2019s agenda. That\u2019s disqualifying for any partisan Republican.\" And there you have it, an updated version of Vince Lombardi\u2019s famous quote: \"Winning isn\u2019t everything, it\u2019s the only thing.\" Once you go there \u2013 that personal misconduct doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 you\u2019re in Trump\u2019s \"shoot someone on Fifth Avenue\" territory. If you lied, cheated, robbed a bank, it can be buried or dismissed if that helps your team at election time. Character? That\u2019s for wimps. But I have to raise one other point, which is whether only one party is drawing media scrutiny. Trump said he\u2019d heard \"horrible\" things about Raphael Warnock. In an incident that surfaced in the last campaign, the senator\u2019s ex-wife accused him of running over her foot with a car during a dispute (medical officials found no injuries). In a court filing related to custody earlier this year, she accused Warnock of leaving her \"financially strapped\" by refusing to reimburse her for child care expenses.

    "Midterm attacks: Herschel Walker hit on abortion payment report, Dr. Oz on alleged quackery": [
        " \n        By\n        Howard Kurtz   | Fox News ",
        " The final weeksof a midterm campaignis when everyone, from political operatives to media outlets, drops their worst oppo. That\u2019s when voters are paying the most attention and when a competitive race can break a certain way. That\u2019s especially true with this fall's Senate races, where a single battleground state may determine whether Mitch McConnell becomes majority leader again. Thecontest in Georgiajust got rocked by a new round of accusations against Herschel Walker, which he denies. The former football star, challenging Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, has already survived a negative onslaught that would sink almost any other candidate. These range from an ex-wife charging threats and abuse to the emergence of previously unannounced children by a man who\u2019s crusaded for black fathers to do their duty. He\u2019s tried to lighten this baggage by admitting to past mistakes and mental health problems, and at times has been in a statistical tie with Warnock. Now comes an allegation that is very difficult to explain away. TRUMP, MCCONNELL, EXTREME INSULTS AND A CLIMATE VIOLENCE Walker is 100% pro-life and would ban abortion in his state,likening it to murder,with no exceptions. So charges of hypocrisy took center stage whenthe Daily Beastreported an accusation by an ex-girlfriend that Walker paid for her abortion in 2009. He denies, this, calling it a \"flat-out lie.\" Here\u2019s the evidence involving the woman, who was not named: \"She supported these claims with a $575 receipt from the abortion clinic, a \u2018get well\u2019 card from Walker, and a bank deposit receipt that included an image of a signed $700 personal check from Walker. \"The woman said there was a $125 difference because she \u2018ball-parked\u2019 the cost of an abortion after Googling the procedure and added on expenses such as travel and recovery costs. \"Additionally, The Daily Beast independently corroborated details of the woman\u2019s claims with a close friend she told at the time and who, according to the woman and the friend, took care of her in the days after the procedure. \"The woman said Walker, who was not married at the time, told her it would be more convenient to terminate the pregnancy, saying it was \u2018not the right time\u2019 for him to have a child.\" Asked about the check by Fox News' Sean Hannity, Walker said: \"I send money to a lot of people. I believe in being generous.\" Sorry, but that\u2019s a really weak response. What are the odds that a woman that Walker chose to be generous with just happens to be the one sayinghe paid for her abortion,and has a receipt from the clinic? And there is a one-two punch here, with Walker\u2019s 23-year-old son Christian, who has defended his father and campaigned with him, suddenly turning on him. \"You\u2019re not a \u2018family man\u2019 when you left us to bang a bunch of women, threatened to kill us, and had us move over 6 times in 6 months running from your violence,\" he tweeted. Herschel Walker responded: \"I LOVE my son no matter what.\" That brought even stronger language from Christian, with a tweet he later deleted: \"You have 4 kids that we know of and you weren\u2019t in the house raising ONE of them, you were out cheating and lying. If you loved your kids you\u2019d be raising them instead of running for a senate race to boost your ego.\" What\u2019s more, Christian said family members had discouraged his dad fromrunning for the Senate\"because we all knew (some of) his past.\" There is something about a son turning on a father that feels more dramatic and persuasive than allegations from an ex-wife, which might be written off as the product of a bitter divorce. Christian\u2019s mother, Cindy Grossman, has spoken of the time that Herschel \"held the gun to my temple and said he was going to blow my brains out.\" Grossman, who was married to him for two decades, has made an ad with such graphic allegations. Football legend or not, Walker\u2019s going to have a hard time outrunning the abortion allegation. In the Senate race in another battleground state, Pennsylvania, Dr. Oz trails Democrat and stroke victim John Fetterman by a half-dozen points in most polls. Oz is\u00a0now being hit with one allegation I view as totally fair game and another that decidedly is not. WHEN A MAJOR HURRICANE COLLIDES WITH OTHER NEWS, THE STORM PREVAILS TheWashington Postleads off its piece this way: \"Mehmet Oz looked directly into the camera and introduced his daytime television viewers to a \u2018controversial\u2019 weight loss approach: taking a hormone that women produce during pregnancy combined with a diet of 500 calories a day. \"\u2018Does it really work? Is it safe? Is it a miracle? Or is it hype?\u2019 he asked in a 2011 episode of \u2018The Dr. Oz Show\u2019 before introducing his audience to \u2018human chorionic gonadotropin,\u2019 or HCG, and to a weight loss doctor who promoted it. \"In fact, there was little uncertain about the HCG Diet. Numerous studies conducted years before Oz\u2019s show had shown that the fertility drug does not cause weight loss, redistribute fat or suppress hunger. Ten months later, the Food and Drug Administration warned seven companies marketing HCG products they were violating the law by making such claims, and the agency issued additional warnings to consumers in subsequent years. Nevertheless, Oz revisited the topic in 2012, providing a platform for the same weight loss doctor, who claimed that HCG worked.\" There are other examples, and the reason this is legitimate is that Oz\u2019s controversial promotions were debated for years when he was just a television celebrity. And that role, of course, formed the basis of his candidacy, that he was a successful entrepreneur who could be trusted. An Oz spokesman said the show was designed to present all kinds of views, and it\u2019s \"idiotic and preposterous to imply\" that the doctor shared those beliefs. Which brings us to yesterday, whenNBC used its websiteto promote anti-Oz piece that is, quite simply, outrageous: \"From 1989 to 2010,research by Dr. Mehmet Oz\u2014 the television personality and Republican Senate candidate in Pennsylvania \u2014 inflicted suffering on and killed over 300 dogs, 31 pigs and 661 rabbits and rodents. It was during Oz\u2019s time as a principal investigator at a Columbia University lab.\" The report was attributed to the website Jezebel. This is a ridiculous cheap shot, written by a professor with an obvious agenda, that implies Oz was some ghoulish dog-killer. The truth is that all doctors, scientists and researchers rely on animal testing when it comes to new drugs. Actually, it\u2019s even worse: They are required by law to perform animal testing. SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF ON THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES Oz is no different than all of his colleagues in the field.

        " \n        By\n        Howard Kurtz   | Fox News ",
        " In a world in which the SEC charges Kim Kardashian with promoting a crypto brand on Instagram without disclosing she was paid $250,000, we are constantly confronted with instances ofcelebrities behaving badly. In a world in which politicians use crude attacks to build their brand \u2013 Marjorie Taylor Greene has already filed impeachment resolutions against President Biden and uses them to raise money \u2013 we\u2019ve become inured to a culture of demonization. The media have for years helped foster this climate, where only increasingly extreme denunciations break through the static. It was hardly inventedby Donald Trump. But Trump seized the moment with his mastery of the news cycle, using rallies and Twitter (and now Truth Social) to bash and belittle his political foes, often counterpunching against denunciations by them or the fourth estate. Any Republicans who fought him were labeled RINOs and many were knocked off in primaries, leaving a party in which the former president remains the dominant figure. WHEN A MAJOR HURRICANE COLLIDES WITH OTHER NEWS, THE STORM PREVAILS So dominant, in fact, that amajority of Republicanstell pollsters they believe Trump\u2019s continued claims that the 2020 election was stolen, which much of the rest of the country and the vast majority of the media dismiss as a big lie. The Justice Department\u2019s investigation of the ex-president for taking and withholding classified documents only convinces his supporters that the establishment is out to get him. Trump has beenattacking Mitch McConnellever since the senator broke with him in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 riot. He has called the Republican leader some version of an \"Old Crow\" so many times that nobody blinks anymore. So the man who privately called his own supporters \"f------ crazy,\" according to Maggie Haberman\u2019s book, escalated even more. He started out accusing McConnell of approving trillions in Democrat-sponsored bills because \"he hates Donald J. Trump\" or wants to \"take the Country down with him.\" (Perhaps McConnell thought infrastructure, computer chips and helping ailing veterans was a good idea?) \"He has a DEATH WISH. Must immediately seek help and advise [sic] from his China loving wife, Coco Chow!\" Now I was more offended by the obvious racist reference to Mitch\u2019s wife Elaine Chao, who was Trump\u2019s own Transportation secretary. Her crime was that she resigned immediatelyafter Jan. 6.Still: Chow? I didn\u2019t see the death wish part as an attempt to stir up violence, but many people disagree. I viewed it more as Trump trolling one of his favorite targets, and am not sure whether the media should take the bait. Does every over-the-top insult need to be covered? The Wall Street Journal\u2019s conservative editorial page, which supported many of his presidential initiatives but has been tough on his post-White House conduct, disagrees: \"The \u2018death wish\u2019 rhetoric is ugly even by Mr. Trump\u2019s standards and deserves to be condemned. Mr. Trump\u2019s apologists claim he merely meant Mr. McConnell has a political death wish, but that isn\u2019t what he wrote. It\u2019s all too easy to imagine some fanatic taking Mr. Trump seriously and literally, and attempting to kill Mr. McConnell. Many supporters took Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric aboutformer Vice President Mike Penceall too seriously on Jan. 6.\" Fair point; there are plenty of crazy people out there. The editorial doesn\u2019t stop there: \"Five weeks from Election Day, Mr. Trump could be working and spending money to elect a GOP Congress or to help his home state ofFlorida recover from Hurricane Ian.Instead he\u2019s attacking Mr. McConnell and his wife as part of a personal political vendetta, and putting every Republican candidate on the spot to respond to questions about the Trump rant. Mr. Trump always puts himself first, and with this rhetoric he may put others at genuine risk of harm.\" Even if he meant political death wish, it\u2019s ambiguous enough that it could be interpreted that way. (McConnell makes a general practice of not commenting on Trump.) MEDIA DISMISS TRUMP-BACKED NOMINEES AS LOSERS, BUT MANY REMAIN COMPETITIVE The New York Times ties the Trump era to a tenfold increase in threats against members of Congress: \"In Bangor, Maine, an unknown visitor smashed a storm window at Senator Susan Collins\u2019s home. \"In Seattle, a man who had sent an angry email to Representative Pramila Jayapal repeatedly showed up outside the lawmaker\u2019s house, armed with a semiautomatic handgun and shouting threats and profanities.\" SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF ON THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES Collins told the paper that \"I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if a senator or House member were killed.\" The media were far less concerned when an armed manthreatening to kill Brett Kavanaughtraveled to within a block of his Maryland home (before providing the tip that prompted police to arrest him). The Biden administration never explicitly denounced this. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And we only have to go back to 2017 to recall the unhinged liberal who shot up a Republican baseball practice in Virginia, seriously wounding GOP Whip Steve Scalise. So things are ugly out there. Whatever Trump had in mind with McConnell and Chao, it wasn\u2019t exactly a high-minded appeal to our better angels. Footnote: Despite granting New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman three lengthy interviews for her book and referring to her as his \"psychiatrist,\" Trump has escalated his rhetoric since \"Confidence Man\" came out. First he called her a \"self-appointed head case\" and a \"creep.\" Now she\u2019s \"Maggot Haberman\" and \"a bad writer with very bad sources!\" Haberman, who engaged in extensive fact-checking with Trump, said in the book she\u2019s accustomed to his alternating cycles of positivity and name-calling.",

    "IMF warns of higher recession risk and darker global outlook": [
        "By FATIMA HUSSEINOctober 6, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The International Monetary Fund is once again lowering its projections for global economic growth in 2023, projecting world economic growth lower by $4 trillion through 2026. Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the IMF, told an audience at Georgetown University on Thursday that \u201cthings are more likely to get worse before it gets better,\u201d saying the Russian invasion of Ukraine that began in February has dramatically changed the IMF\u2019s outlook on the economy. The ongoingCOVID-19 pandemic, rising inflation and worsening climate conditions are also impacting world economies, exacerbating other crises, like food insecurity and high debt levels held by lower-income countries. \u201cThe risks of recession are rising,\u201d she said, adding that the IMF estimates that countries making up one-third of the world economy will see at least two consecutive quarters of economic contraction this or next year. Georgieva said the institution downgraded its global growth projections already three times. It now expects 3.2% for 2022 and now 2.9% for 2023. The bleak projections come ascentral banks around the worldraise interest rates in hopes of taming rising inflation. The U.S. Federal Reserve has been the most aggressive in using interest rate hikes as an inflation-cooling tool, though central banks from Asia to England have begun to raise rates this week. Georgieva said \u201ctightening monetary policy too much and too fast \u2014 and doing so in a synchronized manner across countries \u2014 could push many economies into prolonged recession.\u201d Many countries are already seeing major impacts of the invasion of Ukraine on their economies, and the IMF\u2019s grim projections are in line with other forecasts for declines in growth. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development last week said the global economy isset to lose $2.8 trillionin output in 2023 because of the war. The projections come after the OPEC+ alliance of oil-exporting countriesdecided Wednesdayto sharply cut production to support sagging oil prices in a move that could deal the struggling global economy another blow and raise politically sensitive pump prices for U.S. drivers just ahead of key national elections in November.",

    "Fetterman records show light schedule as Pa. lieutenant gov.": [
        "By MARC LEVY and BRIAN SLODYSKOOctober 6, 2022 GMT",
        " HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) \u2014 In his campaign for a crucialU.S. Senate seat, Democrat John Fetterman takes credit for reinventing Pennsylvania\u2019s lieutenant governor\u2019s office, transforming it from a political pit stop into a \u201cbully pulpit\u201d from which he\u2019s advanced progressive causes. Records from Fetterman\u2019s four years in office, however, offer a different portrait of his time in the $179,000-a-year elected job. They show Fetterman typically kept a light work schedule and was often absent from state business, including presiding over the state Senate, which is one of his chief duties, according to an Associated Press review of his daily calendars and attendance records. The review found that Fetterman\u2019s daily schedule was blank during roughly one-third of workdays from January 2019, when he first took office, to May of this year, when he suffered a seriousstroke. Even on days where his schedule showed he was active, a typical work day for Fetterman lasted between four and five hours, the records show. The findings, which focus entirely on his tenure before his stroke, are notable because Fetterman points to his time as lieutenant governor as a leading credential in his Senate campaign. And as his bid for a seat that could swing theSenate majoritybecomes more competitive, some Democrats privately worry that Fetterman is proving a lackluster candidate and losing ground in the campaign. Fetterman\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t explain the gaps in his schedule. In a statement, his spokesman, Joe Calvello, said that \u201cthis report is a misleading and inaccurate reflection of John\u2019s actual schedule that totally fails to capture the breadth of his official work and his accomplishments.\u201d Fetterman didn\u2019t respond to interview requests, but he said in a statement that he\u2019s \u201cshown I can have an impact beyond the prescribed power of a given office.\u201d \u201cAs lieutenant governor,\u201d he said, \u201cmy record of showing up and shaking up this office has transformed the Board of Pardons, saved Pennsylvania millions in taxpayer dollars, and grown support in our state for defending LGBTQIA+ rights, weed legalization, union workers, and raising the minimum wage.\u201d The job of lieutenant governor is typically a stopover for politicians seeking higher office and often comes with limited duties. In Pennsylvania, the primary legal responsibilities for a lieutenant governor are presiding over Senate sessions, chairing the Board of Pardons and heading up the governor\u2019s emergency management committee. There\u2019s no suggestion that Fetterman\u2019s absences prevented the state from conducting important business, and his formal calendars may not capture the full range of his activities. And, due at least in part to Fetterman\u2019s criminal justice advocacy, the state agency that handles applications for pardons and commutations of life sentences saw a surge in activity while he chaired it. That produced a big jump in grants of clemency by Gov. Tom Wolf. Fetterman\u2019s defenders say the pandemic sapped opportunities for him to take a more active role and note that Wolf did not call on him to take on a bigger workload. \u201cI believe he ... would have to liked to,\u201d state Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa, D-Allegheny, said of Fetterman. \u201cEvery time (Wolf) called on John to communicate, he did.\u201d In a statement, Wolf said Fetterman\u2019s office has \u201climited responsibilities\u201d but called him \u201ca dedicated public servant who has supported my priorities over the past four years.\u201d Fetterman\u2019s daily schedules offer a window into his time in office, detailing his obligations including meetings, phone calls, hearings and even drive time to events around the state. In 2019, Fetterman\u2019s first year in office, he regularly attended ribbon cuttings and conducted a statewide listening tour focused on legalizing marijuana. Still, on 47 different work days he had nothing on his schedules. His workload plummeted after thecoronavirus pandemichit, the schedules show. For months, starting in March 2020, his work days often consisted of a morning meeting focused on the pandemic that typically lasted 45 minutes, sometimes followed by interviews with local and national journalists. Occasionally he would attend virtual events. But Fetterman also did not take an active role and seldom participated in the daily Cabinet meetings, even though he was tapped to head a task force on disparities in the COVID-19 response. It produced a 32-page report. In some cases, he booked national media interviews during times he otherwise had state business to attend to, including presiding over the Senate, or pandemic work group meetings. During a one-month period beginning in October 2020, the vast majority of events listed on Fetterman\u2019s calendar were interviews with national or Washington-based news outlets, with a scattering of official duties and events mixed in, the records show. In 2021, Fetterman\u2019s calendars showed 115 work days with no activities or events listed. That includes a period that stretched from the end of June to mid-September where Fetterman\u2019s schedules were largely blank, listing a total of about 11 hours worked during that period. In the first half of 2022, lasting up to his stroke, there are nearly 70 days with nothing on listed on his schedule. Fetterman\u2019s work ethic has been a persistent focus of attack in the Senate campaign by Republicans who characterize the 53-year-old as a trust fund beneficiary who never had a paying job until he was elected lieutenant governor. Fetterman\u2019s father was a partner in an insurance firm. Asked on a radio program Wednesday to respond to the claim that he\u2019d \u201cnever worked a day in your life,\u201d Fetterman said it wasn\u2019t true. For 13 years he was the mayor of Braddock, a tiny, struggling steel town of 2,000 residents outside Pittsburgh. He called being mayor \u201ca full-time job, fighting to bring (back) a community that was abandoned, left behind.\u201d Fetterman has also told of working for an insurance firm in Connecticut in the 1990s. He also held a job helping young people get GED certificates. Still, Fetterman\u2019s 2015 financial disclosure when he first ran for U.S. Senate showed that he was paid just $1,800 a year to be Braddock\u2019s mayor and lived off $54,000 given to him by his parents that year alone. Property records show that he bought his home in Braddock from his sister for $1. That has fueled a 25-second digital ad from the campaign of Republican nominee Mehmet Oz that touts the legend \u201cFreeloading Fetterman\u201d over the vague image of a man in a black hoodie \u2014 Fetterman wears hoodies just about everywhere he goes. The narrator finishes, \u201cThank goodness for daddy\u2019s deep pockets.\u201d At a rally in Wilkes-Barre last month, former PresidentDonald Trumpcalled Fetterman \u201ca spoiled and entitled socialist loser who leeched off his parents\u2019 money \u2014 you know he lives on his parents\u2019 money \u2014 until he was 49 years old.\u201d It\u2019s a line of criticism first used by Fetterman\u2019s Democratic rivals in past campaigns, whispering that he blew off city council meetings rather than face critics while serving as mayor of Braddock. Records show that Fetterman skipped at least 53 city council meetings during his 13 years as the town\u2019s mayor, or roughly one-third of the meetings held during his tenure. It\u2019s a trend that extends to his duties presiding over the Pennsylvania state Senate. In 2020, Fetterman did not preside during 27 of the 53 Senate sessions that year, according to Senate journals, a period when the chamber adapted to the pandemic by letting numerous members connect to sessions through video links. Fetterman did not show up for one-third of the Senate\u2019s 59 session days in 2021. This year, he was present for 15 of 16 session days before suffering a stroke in May. He came back to preside over the Senate\u2019s session on Sept. 21 \u2014 then skipped the next two days of Senate sessions as he returned to the campaign trail. Fetterman\u2019s campaign attributes 20 of his absences in 2020 to COVID-19 restrictions \u2014 although that did not stop a number of senators from attending sessions in person. It also attributed 10 absences to conflicts with Board of Pardons meetings or other official business. ___ Slodysko reported from Washington.",

    "Falsehoods, harassment stress local election offices in US": [
        "By JULIE CARR SMYTHOctober 6, 2022 GMT",
        " CARROLLTON, Ohio (AP) \u2014 With early voting less than three weeks away, Nicole Mickley was staring down a daunting to-do list: voting machines to test, poll workers to recruit, an onslaught of public records requests to examine. And then, over a weekend, came word that the long-time county sheriff had died. To Mickley, director of elections in a small Ohio county, that added one more complication to an election season filled with them. It meant a new contest was needed to fill the position, so she and her small staff would have to remake the ballotsfor the fall electionfor the second time in a week. \u201cI feel like ever since we took office in \u201919, it\u2019s just been a constant rollercoaster,\u201d said Mickley, whose 36 months on the job qualify her as the senior member of her four-person staff in the Carroll County elections office. The office Mickley oversees is tucked in a corner of the 137-year-old county courthouse in Carrollton, a close-knit town of 3,200 that sits amid the farm fields and fracking wells of eastern Ohio. She and Deputy Director Cheri Whipkey\u2019s son graduated from high school together. The director and her deputy seem an unlikely pair to be contending with the wrath of a nation. Yet ever since former President Donald Trumpbegan falsely claimingthat the 2020 presidential election was stolen, Mickley, Whipkey and local election workers like them across the country have been inundated with conspiracy theories and election falsehoods, and hounded with harassment. They\u2019ve been targeted bythreats, stressed by rising workloads and stretched budgets. The stress and vitriolhave driven many workers away, creating shortages of election office staff and poll workers. During Ohio\u2019s second primary in August \u2014 an added burden for election officials stemming frompartisan feuding over redistricting\u2014 Mickley\u2019s two clerks darted around the county all day filling in for absent poll workers. Two staff members\u2019 husbands were enlisted to help. And then there\u2019s thestream of misinformationfalsely alleging that voting systems across the country are riddled with fraud. Unfoundedconspiracy theoriesabout voting machines, manipulation of elections by artificial intelligence or ballot fixing have founda wide audience among Republicans. The claims sometimes lead voters \u2014 usually friends and neighbors of the Carroll County election staff \u2014 to question them about voting equipment and election procedures, no longer clear what to believe about a system they\u2019ve trusted all their lives. Thefalse claimsabout the 2020 presidential election also have led believers toinundate election officesaround the country with public records requests related to voting processes or equipment, demands to retain the 2020 ballots instead of destroying them, and attempts to remove certain voters from the rolls. Carroll County hasn\u2019t been immune, even though it\u2019s heavily Republican and voted for Trump by nearly 53 percentage points over President Joe Biden in 2020. The county of nearly 27,000 people was flooded over the summer with form-letter emails from self-proclaimed \u201caggrieved citizens.\u201d They were protesting electronic voting machines, vowing to sue or demanding the county retain thousands of records from past elections. Follow-up letters warned that election officials will \u201cbe met with the harshest possible criminal and civil repercussions available under the law\u201d if they destroy any election records. In response, a floor-to-ceiling locked cabinet in Mickley\u2019s office is now jammed with boxes of ballots and other records from 2020, papers that normally would have been destroyed by now to make way for the records of the 2022 election. \u201cWe\u2019re already busting at the seams,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a small office in the bottom basement of the courthouse that was built in the 1800s. Space is not our friend.\u201d Whipkey notes that none of the complaint letters are from local residents, so many of whom she knows personally after 16 years managing the local McDonald\u2019s. She and Mickley both feel lucky they are only receiving letters \u2014 not thedeath threatsexperienced by some election officials around the country. Still, the accusations sting. Whipkey said she hates being called a liar. \u201cIf they wanted the answer, they would have come and asked us. We could give it to them,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they don\u2019t want the answer; they just want to harass.\u201d Mickley said attending national conferences has persuaded her that election workers across the U.S. are just as honest, hard-working and passionate as her staff is: \u201cI\u2019m starting to get defensive and angry for them, too.\u201d Behind a Plexiglas window in the front of the office, the other two election staffers answer calls and process voter registration forms and change-of-address and absentee ballot requests. They\u2019re also preparing the precinct kits that will go to poll workers \u2014 positions the office is still trying to fill for the Nov. 8 election, when they expect heavy turnout partly because Ohio has one of the most closely watched U.S. Senate races in the country. Clerks Sarah Dyck, a Democrat, and Deloris Kean, a Republican, keep their personal feelings about the movement spawned by Trump\u2019s election lies out of the office. They don\u2019t want to bring politics into their work helping run the county\u2019s elections. When she\u2019s out in the community, Dyck said neighbors are mostly sympathetic about how stressful elections work has become in recent years. \u201cPeople all the time say, \u2018I don\u2019t know about this, but I know you guys are doing a good job,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like with congressmen, right? \u2018Well, I don\u2019t like Congress, but my congressman\u2019s okay.\u2019 The closer you are to it, you know the people, and so it\u2019s about those relationships.\u201d That\u2019s not always been the experience of members of the Carroll County Board of Elections. The four members of the bipartisan panel \u2014 a retired railroad worker, a farmer, a facilities operator and the owner of a local yoga studio \u2014 hold their meetings at a table wedged between Mickley\u2019s and Whipkey\u2019s desks in the cramped office. A collection of whiskey bottles shaped like elephants and donkeys sits atop a metal filing cabinet nearby. Some members said they must work constantly to dispel false information that is rampant in the Republican-dominated county. Roger Thomas, one of the board\u2019s two Republicans and the operator of a popular pumpkin stand, said he\u2019s frustrated that many of his friends \u201care unwilling to get past what they think they know with the facts.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what you say to them, you can\u2019t convince them,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we combat that. They don\u2019t care if they gum up the works of these elections, and that\u2019s the problem. If these elections go haywire, go south \u2014 as the elections go, so goes the country.\u201d Mickley said she is a perfectionist who would never tolerate the slightest interference with carrying out secure and accurate elections. She chokes up when talking about how seriously she takes her job and how she and her staff long to ease the worries of skeptical voters. The widespread belief in election conspiracy theories and hostility toward front-line election workers leaves Mickley questioning the country\u2019s future. \u201cI think about my kids,\u201d she said, \u201cand I think about what I want to leave for them and what I want to build now to make sure that they still have it in 20, 30 years. And I\u2019m not alone in that.\u201d ___ Associated Press writer Holly Ramer in Concord, New Hampshire, contributed to this report. ___ Associated Press coverage of democracy receives support from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.

        "October 6, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 WNBA starBrittney Grineris at her \u201cabsolute weakest moment in life right now\u201d as she faces a hearing in Russia later this month for her appeal of a nine-year prison sentence for drug possession, Griner\u2019s wife said in an interview aired Thursday. Cherelle Griner told \u201cCBS Mornings\u201d that her wife, a two-time Olympic gold medalist who was playing in Russia during the WNBA offseason, is afraid of being forgotten by the United States. \u201cShe\u2019s very afraid about being left and forgotten in Russia, or just completely used to the point of her detriment,\u201d Cherelle Griner said. She said Brittney Griner told her in a phone call that she felt \u201clike my life just doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d \u201cLike, y\u2019all don\u2019t see the need to get me back home? Am I just nothing?\u201d Cherelle Griner quoted her wife as saying. It wasn\u2019t clear when the call took place. Brittney Griner was convicted Aug. 4after Russian police said they found vape canisters with cannabis oil in her luggage at Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow. Her defense lawyers said she had been prescribed cannabis for pain. The WNBA star said she had inadvertently packed them and had no criminal intent. She is appealing her prison sentence;the hearing is scheduled for Oct. 25.But Cherelle Griner said after that hearing, her wife could potentially be moved to a labor camp elsewhere in Russia. \u201cMy brain can\u2019t even fathom it,\u201d she said in the CBS interview. President Joe Biden met with Cherelle Griner at the White House last month. He also sat down with Elizabeth Whelan, the sister ofPaul Whelan,another American currently imprisoned in Russia. The Biden administration said in July that it had made a \u201csubstantial proposal\u201d to get them home. The administration has not provided specifics about its proposal, but a person familiar with the matter previously confirmed it had offered to releaseViktor Bout, a convicted Russian arms dealer imprisoned in the U.S. Cherelle Griner said the president is \u201cdoing what he can, but there\u2019s another party in this situation.\u201d She said it\u2019s going to take Russian President Vladimir Putin changing his mindset. Though Brittney Griner was arrested in February \u2014 amid escalated tensions because of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine \u2014- the couple did not speak on the phone until August. Cherelle Griner said the first conversation was \u201cjust so delightful\u201d and felt optimistic that her wife would survive the ordeal. But the second conversation, she said, \u201cwas the most disturbing phone call I\u2019ve ever experienced.\u201d \u201cYou could hear that she was not OK,\u201d Cherelle Griner said.",

    "Biden to mark IBM investment with Democrats in tough races": [
        "By AAMER MADHANIOctober 6, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014President Joe Bidenis ready to celebrate a new $20 billion investment by IBM in New York\u2019s Hudson River Valley with two House Democrats running in competitive races in next month\u2019s critical midterm elections. Biden is taking part in a Thursday afternoon announcement at the IBM facility in Poughkeepsie, New York. He is expected to hold out the company\u2019s plans as part of what the White House says is a manufacturing \u201cboom\u201d spurred by this summer\u2019s passage of a $280 billion legislative packageintended to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry and scientific research. Democrats facing tough midterms races have largely avoided appearing with Biden in the leadup to November\u2019s elections. But Biden, whoseapproval ratings remain underwater,will be joined by two House incumbents in competitive New York races who are bucking the trend: Reps. Sean Patrick Maloney and Pat Ryan. \u201cWhen I heard @POTUS was looking to see the benefits of the CHIPS & Science Act first-hand, I told him that the Hudson Valley was the perfect place,\u201d Maloney wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled to host him in Poughkeepsie this week to celebrate the major wins and good-paying jobs we are delivering here in NY.\u201d The CHIPS and Science Act,which Biden signed into law in August,was a rare piece of legislation for which the president was able to win bipartisan support. IBM\u2019s $20 billion investment over the next decade is intended to bolster research and development and manufacturing of semiconductors, mainframe technology, artificial intelligence and quantum computing in New York\u2019s Hudson River Valley, according to the White House. \u201cAs we tackle large-scale technological challenges in climate, energy, transportation and more, we must continue to invest in innovation and discovery \u2014 because advanced technologies are key to solving these problems and driving economic prosperity, including better jobs, for millions of Americans,\u201d said Arvind Krishna, IBM\u2019s chairman and CEO. The IBM investment comes on the heels ofchipmaker Micron announcingearlier this week an investment of up to $100 billion over the next 20-plus years to build a plant in upstate New York that could create 9,000 factory jobs. Maloney, chairman of the powerful Democratic congressional campaign fundraising arm, is running against Republican state Assemblyman Mike Lawler in New York\u2019s 17th District. Ryan is up against state Assemblyman Colin Schmitt in the 18th District. The boundaries of most New York districts, including Maloney\u2019s and Ryan\u2019s, have been affected by redistricting. Ryan in August won a close special election to serve out the term of Democrat Antonio Delgado, who vacated his 19th District seat after he was appointed lieutenant governor by Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul. Ryan is running to serve a full term in the 18th District, where he lives. Maloney, who had served New York\u2019s 18th District since 2013, decided to run in the 17th District. His Hudson Valley home fell inside the new boundaries after redistricting. Hochul, who took office last year after Democrat Andrew Cuomo resigned amid sexual harassment allegations, is also scheduled to attend. She\u2019s looking to win a full term in next month\u2019s election against Republican Rep. Lee Zeldin. Later Thursday, Biden will head to central New Jersey for a fundraiser at the home of Gov. Phil Murphy in support of the Democratic National Committee. In the evening, he heads to Manhattan for a Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee fundraiser hosted by James Murdoch, the son of conservative News Corp. publisher Rupert Murdoch. Murdoch and his wife, Kathryn, a climate change activist, were major donors to Biden\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign. In 2020,Murdoch resignedfrom the board of News Corp. amid differences over editorial content at his father\u2019s company, which operates The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post. The elder Murdoch is also chairman of Fox Corp., which includes Fox News Channel.

    "Report: Mom of Walker\u2019s child says he paid for her abortion": [
        "October 6, 2022 GMT",
        " ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 A woman who saidHerschel Walkerpaid for her 2009 abortion is the mother of one of his children, according to anew report Wednesday, undercutting the Georgia Republican Senate candidate\u2019s claims that he didn\u2019t know who she was. The Daily Beast, which first reported Monday on the abortion, said it had agreed not to reveal details of the woman\u2019s identity to protect her privacy. But Walker, who has expressed support for a national abortion ban without exceptions, vehemently denied the story, calling the abortion allegation a \u201cflat-out lie,\u201d threatening a lawsuit against the outlet he has yet to file and saying he had no idea who the woman might be. So on Wednesday night, The Daily Beast revealed that the woman \u2014 who was not named \u2014 was so well known to Walker that, according to her, they conceived another child years after the abortion. She decided to continue on with the later pregnancy, though she noted that Walker, as he had during the earlier pregnancy, expressed that it wasn\u2019t a convenient time for him, the outlet reported. The Daily Beast said the Walker campaign declined to comment on Wednesday\u2019s story. Walker is scheduled to make a public appearance Thursday morning in Wadley, Georgia, as part of his Unite Georgia Bus Stop tour across the state. The latest reporting ensures that abortion will continue to be a central issue in the Georgia race, one of the most competitive Senate contests in the country. Walker and Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock are locked in a tight contest that is key to the balance of power in the U.S. Senate. It adds to a series of stories about the football legend\u2019s past that have shaken Walker\u2019s campaign. Walker has been accused of repeatedly threatening his ex-wife\u2019s life, exaggerating claims of financial success and overstating his role in a for-profit program that is alleged to have preyed upon veterans and service members while defrauding the government. Earlier this year, after a story by The Daily Beast, Walkeracknowledged the existence of three childrenhe had not previously talked about publicly. The woman told The Daily Beast for Wednesday\u2019s story that Walker\u2019s denial of the abortion was somewhat surprising to her. \u201cSure, I was stunned, but I guess it also doesn\u2019t shock me, that maybe there are just so many of us that he truly doesn\u2019t remember,\u201d the woman said. \u201cBut then again, if he really forgot about it, that says something, too.\u201d In The Daily Beast report published late Monday, the news outlet said it reviewed a receipt showing her payment for the procedure, along with a get-well card from Walker and her bank deposit records showing the image of a $700 personal check from Walker dated five days after the abortion receipt. During the Republican Senate primary, Walker openly backed a national ban on abortions with no exceptions for cases involving rape, incest or a woman\u2019s health being at risk \u2014 particularly notable at a time when the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court precedent had been overturned and Democrats in Congress had been discussing codifying abortion rights into federal law. \u201cI\u2019m for life,\u201d Walker has said repeatedly as he campaigns. When asked about whether he\u2019d allow for any exceptions, he has said there are \u201cno excuses\u201d for the procedure. As the Republican nominee, Walker has sometimes sidestepped questions about his earlier support for a national abortion ban, a tacit nod to the fact that most voters, including many Republicans, want at least some legal access to abortion.",

    "Biden juggles Iran nuke talks as Iranian repression grows": [
        "By MATTHEW LEE and AAMER MADHANIOctober 5, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden has hit back at Iran over thegovernment\u2019s brutal crackdown on antigovernment protests.He\u2019s praised the\u201cbrave women of Iran\u201dfor demanding basic rights and signaled that he\u2019ll announce more sanctions against those responsible for violence against protesters in the coming days. The outpouring of anger\u2014 largely led by young women and directed at the government\u2019s male leadership \u2014 has created a seminal moment for the country, spurring some of the largest and boldest protests against the country\u2019s Islamic leadership seen in years. And while the Biden administration says it is dedicated to standing by the women of Iran, the president faces a tough question: Can he credibly side with the protest movement while also trying to salvage the languishing 2015 Iran nuclear deal that would pump billions into Tehran\u2019s treasury? \u201cThe risk of a nuclear Iran is terrifying on all levels,\u201d Marjan Keypour Greenblatt, director of a network of activists that promotes human rights in Iran and a nonresident scholar with the Middle East Institute\u2019s Iran Program,wrote in an analysis this week.\u201cHowever, President Biden simply cannot offer the prospect of sanctions relief and de facto legitimize a regime that is ruthlessly gunning down its own citizens in the street.\u201d The weeks-old protests were triggered bythe death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini,who died in Iranian security custody. Morality police had detained Amini last month for not properly covering her hair with the Islamic headscarf, known as the hijab, which is mandatory for Iranian women. Amini collapsed at a police station and died three days later. Her death and the subsequent unrest have come at a complicated moment as the administration tries to bring Iran back into compliance with the nuclear deal that was brokered by the Obama administration and scrapped by the Trump administration. The deal already was teetering toward collapse despite Biden\u2019s efforts to revive it. But the administration has not given up all hope for a turnaround via indirect talks with the Iranian leadership. The pact, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA, would provide Tehran with billions in sanctions relief in exchange for the country agreeing to roll back its nuclear program to the limits set by the 2015 deal. The deal includes caps on enrichment and how much material it can stockpile and limits the operation of advanced centrifuges needed to enrich. Chances for a return to the deal have cometantalizingly closesince the beginning of this year, but have been derailed by Iranian demands that the U.S. maintains are outside the scope of the original agreement. And now, prospects for a resumption in negotiations are bleak at least until later this fall. Critics of thenuclear dealargue that the administration should break off all consideration of a renewed deal. They say the sanctions relief windfall that Iran would enjoy would be used to further repress its own people and fund proxies that would exacerbate broader threats in the region. \u201cThe White House faces an internal strategic contradiction: How can you claim to be holding the regime accountable for internal repression while offering that same regime sanctions relief in Vienna?\u201d said Richard Goldberg, an analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a policy institute focusing on foreign affairs and national security. But the administration has so far held toBiden\u2019s initial campaign position:A deal with Iran will make the world safer. That strongly held viewpoint creates an unusual split-screen dynamic for Biden, who speaks frequently about the need to stand firm in the battle of democracies vs. autocracies. His administration has insisting on keeping nuclear talks with Iran on a separate track \u2014 even while condemning Tehran\u2019sselling drones to Russiafor its war in Ukraine; persistent attacks against U.S. allies in Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Syria and Iraq;holocaust denialismby Iran\u2019s president and supreme leader; the wrongful detention of American citizens; and now a brutal effort to squelch the voices of Iranian women speaking out for basic rights. \u201cLook, I mean ... we have concerns with Iran; we have said that before,\u201d White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said earlier this week. \u201cBut the JCPOA is the best way for us to address the nuclear problem that we see. As long as we believe pursuing JCPOA talks is in the U.S. national security interest, we will do so.\u201d Officials say they are still convinced of the central argument the Obama administration made when it negotiated the original nuclear deal in 2015: An Iran with a nuclear weapon is more dangerous than an Iran without one, no matter what the circumstances. There have been other momentswhen pent-up anger has convulsed the Islamic Republic only to peter out. In 2009, millions took to the streets in what was known as the Green Movement after the government declared the victory of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in a hotly contested presidential election. Tens of thousands of frustrated Iranians protested in 2017 and 2018 against the country\u2019s stunted economy and seeking greater social freedoms. Hundreds of protesters were killed in protests in late 2019 spurred by skyrocketing fuel prices and government policy writ large. But Amini\u2019s death has galvanized a measure of outrage that\u2019s causedreverberations far beyond Iran\u2019s borders.Videos spreading on social media show school girls marching in the streets without hijabs and college-aged students chanting for independence, freedom, and death for Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. The White House says the administration\u2019s support of the protesters has been robust. Biden spokeof the protesters at U.N. General Assemblylast month. The United States moved quickly last week to impose sanctions on the country\u2019s morality police and more sanctions are expected in coming days. Yet, some analysts argue that thus far the administration has offered only a tepid response to the crackdown on the demonstrations. The most significant support the administration has provided to protesters thus far has beeneasing restrictions on the export of software and hardwareto make it easier for Iranians to communicate with each other and the outside world. Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said it\u2019s time for the administration to think bigger. \u201cThe Biden administration should broaden its Iran strategy to focus not only on countering the destructive aspirations of the Iranian regime, but also to champion the constructive aspirations of the Iranian people to live in a free society at peace with the world,\u201d Sadjadpour said.",

    "UN Security Council splits, again, over North Korea missiles": [
        "By ELLEN KNICKMEYEROctober 6, 2022 GMT",
        " Debate over how to handle a North Korean ballisticmissile launch over Japanese territorysplit an already deeply fractured U.N. Security Council on Wednesday, with Russia and China insisting that U.S.-led military exercises in the region had provoked North Korea into acting. Wednesday\u2019s session ended with no agreement on next steps, despite warnings from the U.S. and its allies that the council\u2019s inability to reach consensus on North Korea\u2019s record number of missile launches this year was emboldening North Korea and undermining the authority of the United Nations\u2019 most powerful body. \u201dThis council should be mindful that it is being tested and its credibility is at stake. This council should act, and produce an action that restores its credibility,\u201d said Hiroshi Minami, Japan\u2019s deputy representative to the U.N. and one of those unsuccessfully urging the council back into its formerly unified stand over North Korea\u2019s launches. North Korea\u2019s missile flight Tuesday was its longest-range weapons test ever, a nuclear-capable ballistic missile that soared over Japan and had enough punch to reach the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam and beyond. It forced the Japanese government to issue evacuation alerts and halt trains. The U.N. said the North Korea\u2019sunprecedented number of ballistic missile launchesthis year, now numbering more than 40, comes as North Korea also appears to be moving toward a seventh test nuclear blast. Early Thursday, North Korea launched two ballistic missiles toward its eastern waters just 22 minutes apart, officials said. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is pushing to develop a fully fledged nuclear arsenal capable of threatening the U.S. mainland and the territory of U.S. allies, with a goal of wresting concessions from those countries, some experts say. Tuesday\u2019s launch was the first that Kim has aimed over Japan since 2017. It came within days of aU.S.-led military exercisein the Sea of Japan with allies Japan and South Korea. The exercise included a nuclear-powered U.S. aircraft carrier. Russia\u2019s deputy U.N. representative, Anna Evstigneeva, insisted to Security Council members that it was the \u201cirresponsibility\u201d of that U.S.-led exercise, along with growing U.S. alliances with partners in the Asia-Pacific region, that prompted North Korea\u2019s action. China\u2019s deputy U.N. representative, Geng Shuang, depicted the matter as a confrontation between the U.S. and North Korea, and urged a more conciliatory approach by Washington. Wednesday\u2019s session ended only with a vague call for more discussion on the matter. It served as the latest example of a growing polarization pitting Russia and China against fellow permanent Security Council members the United States, United Kingdom and France. Brought to the forefront by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, China\u2019s military assertiveness in the Asia-Pacific region and the U.S. response to it, and other matters, the divide has paralyzed the Security Council on many key actions. That\u2019s because all five permanent members have the power to veto council actions. The Security Council imposed sanctions after North Korea\u2019s first nuclear test explosion in 2006, and tightened them over the years seeking to rein in its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and cut off funding. In May, however, China and Russia blocked a Security Council resolution that would have toughened sanctions over the missile launches, in the first serious rift on the council over the sanctions against North Korea. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., told Security Council members Wednesday that \u201ctwo permanent members of the Security Council have enabled Kim Jong Un.\u201d Past missile launches this year had clearly been launched without any concurrent U.S. military exercises or any other clear triggers, Thomas-Greenfield said, calling North Korea\u2019s a \u201cself-initiated escalation.\u201d \u201cWe won\u2019t tolerate any country blaming our defensive actions\u2026as somehow the inherent cause of these threats,\u201d she said. She added, \u201cThe United States will not stand by as the DPRK directly threatens\u201d the U.S. or its allies.",

    "Biden and DeSantis join together in Ian recovery effort": [
        "By JOSH BOAK and SEUNG MIN KIMOctober 6, 2022 GMT",
        " FORT MYERS, Florida (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden surveyed the devastation ofhurricane-ravaged Floridaon Wednesday, promising to marshal the power of the federal government to help rebuild as he comforted local residents alongside Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, apotential 2024 foe. Biden praised DeSantis\u2019 handling of the storm recovery as both men \u2014 who have battled over pandemic protocols and migration as the governor mulls a presidential bid \u2014 put aside politics for a few days. The state is struggling to recover from the wreckage of Hurricane Ian, which tore through southwestern Florida last week and left dozens dead. \u201cToday we have one job and only one job, and that\u2019s to make sure the people in Florida get everything they need to fully, thoroughly recover,\u201d Biden said in a community that bore the brunt of Ian\u2019s assault. He warned that the rebuilding effort will take months or years. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a hell of a long time,hopefully without any snagsin the way,\u201d he said as DeSantis stood behind him, hands folded as he squinted into the glaring sunlight. \u201cLater, after the television cameras have moved on, we\u2019re still going to be here with you.\u201d The days after Ian\u2019s landfall in Florida have prompted a temporary d\u00e9tente between Biden and DeSantis, who had spoken on the phone at least three times to coordinate recovery efforts. They spent part of Wednesday meeting with area residents and, for Biden, absorbing the full scope of Ian\u2019s devastation. After Biden and first lady Jill Biden arrived earlier at Fisherman\u2019s Wharf \u2014 where homes and businesses lay in ruins amid debris and muck \u2014 DeSantis offered his hand to the president for a shake. Next to them as they spoke was a boat that the storm had lifted into a cafe The solidarity, however fleeting, continued Wednesday afternoon when DeSantis formally welcomed Biden to his state and praised the collaboration with officials on the ground and the federal government in Washington. \u201cWe are cutting through the red tape and that\u2019s from local government, state government, all the way up to the president. We appreciate the team effort,\u201d DeSantis said. Biden said DeSantis had done a \u201cgood job\u201d when asked by reporters to assess the governor\u2019s handling of the recovery efforts. \u201cWe have very different political philosophies ... but we worked hand in glove,\u201d Biden said. \u201cOn things related to dealing with this crisis, we\u2019ve been completely lockstep. There\u2019s been no difference.\u201d The breadth of the devastation that Biden witnessed was immense. The presidential motorcade drove by wind-shorn trees, some uprooted, others with branches pulled backwards by the storm. Fields off the highway were still flooded, forming stagnant lagoons. Signs for stores and restaurants were blown out; ruined mattresses were piled in neighborhood streets, a building was tipped to the side like a chess piece. An armada of workers and repair trucks struggled with recovery. Hurricane Ianhas resulted in at least 98 people confirmed dead, including 89 in Florida, and many people still wait for power to be restored. Ian\u2019s 150 mph winds andpunishing storm surge last weektook out power for 2.6 million in Florida. Many people still are unable to get food and water, although DeSantis said power has been restored to more than 97% of the state. With the midterm elections just a month away, the crisis was bringing together political rivals incommon causeat least for a time. Biden and DeSantis have had a multitude of differences in recent years over how to fight COVID-19, immigration policy and more. In recent weeks, they tussled over the governor\u2019s decision to put migrants on planes or buses to Democratic strongholds, a practice that Biden has called \u201creckless.\u201d Along with DeSantis, Sen. Rick Scott has also been one of Biden\u2019s most prominent Republican critics. He, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio and other state and local officials joined the president and governor. Rubio, like DeSantis, is up for reelection in November. Jeff Rioux, a general contractor in Fort Myers and a registered Republican, said as he mopped up floors and tore out soaked drywall from his flooded house that he welcomed Biden\u2019s visit. \u201cThe world does need to see what happened here. It\u2019s going get some help down here,\u201d Rioux said of the national attention. \u201cAt some point you\u2019ve got to put politics aside. People are hurting down here. It\u2019s not right or left, it\u2019s America at the end of the day.\u201d Biden resorted to profanity at one point, but only in an apparently jocular comment picked up by a microphone and causing much comment on social media. As Fort Myers Beach Mayor Ray Murphy thanked Biden for coming, the president said at one point in the brief conversation, \u201cNo one f\u2014\u2014 with a Biden,\u201d and appeared to offer the mayor some advice. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly right, that\u2019s exactly right,\u201d Murphy said, laughing. \u201cAll right, good to see you.\u201d Before the storm hit, the president had intended to visit the Florida cities of Orlando and Fort Lauderdale to stress his efforts to strengthen Social Security and Medicaid. Biden has accused Scott of wanting to end both programs by proposing that federal laws should expire every five years, although the Florida senator has said he wants to preserve the programs. The hurricane changed the purpose and tone of Biden\u2019s first trip to Florida this year, which was in an area devastated by winds and surging water. Boats, including huge yachts, were capsized and hurled inland. FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell told reporters on Air Force One that the cost of rebuilding will be significant: \u201cIt will certainly be in the billions and perhaps one of the more costly disasters that we\u2019ve seen in many years.\u201d The White House message of bipartisan unity in a time of crisis marked a difference from Biden\u2019s predecessor, Donald Trump, who at times threatened to withhold aid from the states of Democrats who criticized him, including Govs. Gavin Newsom of California and Andrew Cuomo of New York. ___ Kim reported from Washington.

    "California agencies float Colorado River water cuts proposal": [
        "By KATHLEEN RONAYNEOctober 6, 2022 GMT",
        " SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 California water agencies that rely on the parched Colorado River said Wednesday they can reduce their use by one-tenth starting in 2023 in response to calls for cuts from the federal government. The agencies, which supply water to farmers and millions of people in Southern California, laid out their proposal in a letter to the U.S. Department of the Interior. It comes as drought exacerbated by climate change continues to diminish the river, and months after the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation first called on users to voluntarily limit their reliance on it. California shares the river\u2019s water with six other states, tribes and Mexico. It has rights to the single largest share and isthe last to losewater in times of shortage. The proposal to cut 400,000 acre feet annually marks the first time California water agencies are publicly and formally indicating what they\u2019re willing to give up since federal officials demanded major cuts this summer. California has been under pressure from other states to figure out how to use less as river reservoirs drop so low they risk losing the ability to generate hydropower and deliver water. \u201cWhile a broad multi-state agreement to conserve water across the Basin has not been reached, the California agencies propose to take voluntary action now to conserve water in coming months,\u201d the California agencies wrote. An acre-foot of water is enough to supply about two households for a year. California is entitled to 4.4 million acre feet of Colorado River water each year. Four California agencies use the river\u2019s water: The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, the Imperial Irrigation District, the Palo Verde Irrigation District and the Coachella Valley Water District. The proposed cuts are contingent on the water agencies getting money from the $4 billion in drought relief included in the Inflation Reduction Act, as well as a commitment by the federal government to help clean up the Salton Sea, a drying lake fed by diminishing runoff from Imperial Valley farms. The letter was scant on details. The agencies said they have \u201ca collection of proposed water conservation and water use reduction opportunities\u201d that would help keep more water in Lake Mead, one of the river\u2019s key reservoirs. It did not list any specific projects, or specify the rate of payment the agencies are expecting. But the federal government has previously said the $4 billion could be used for short-term conservation measures, like paying farmers to leave their fields unplanted, and long-term efficiency projects such as lining canals to prevent water loss. The Imperial Irrigation District receives a larger share of the river than any other entity. It\u2019s the only source of water for crops in California\u2019s southeastern desert, where many of the nation\u2019s winter vegetables, like broccoli, as well as feed crops like alfalfa are grown. The district is willing to contribute up to 250,000 of the acre-feet committed by California, General Manager Henry Martinez said in a statement. Farmers in the valley are already planning out their crops for next year. The longer it takes to reach a final deal, the more money farmers could expect as compensation for leaving their fields unplanted, said JB Hamby, a member of the district\u2019s board. \u201cIf you want more participation, the prices will need to be higher,\u201d he said. The Metropolitan Water District relies on the Colorado River to provide a third of Southern California\u2019s urban water supply. In a statement, General Manager Adel Hagekhalil didn\u2019t commit to a specific conservation number but said the district will work with its users and board to figure out a reasonable amount. The Interior Department did not have a comment on the letter, spokesman Tyler Cherry said. All eyes have been on California to offer cuts. Both Arizona and Nevada were told in August they\u2019d get less water under earlier drought agreements. Tom Buschatzke, director of the Arizona Department of Water Resources, declined to comment specifically on California\u2019s letter. But he said earlier Wednesday that Arizona cannot be expected to contribute more than California, considering it stands to lose more under mandatory cuts because of the existing priority structure. \u201cWe want more equitable guidelines, it\u2019s not gallon per gallon,\u201d he said. The Salton Sea formed in 1905, when the Colorado River overflowed, and was once considered a destination. But the lake has been drying up in recent decades, exposing residents to harmful dust and hurting ecosystems. In 2019, when the Lower Basin states negotiated a drought plan, the irrigation district refused to sign on because it didn\u2019t come with money for the sea. California\u2019s letter said any conservation efforts would require a commitment by the federal government to help stabilize the sea. __ Associated Press writer Felicia Fonseca contributed from Flagstaff, Arizona.",

    "Liz Cheney says Arizona GOP candidates threaten democracy": [
        "By BOB CHRISTIEOctober 6, 2022 GMT",
        " PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney on Wednesday said the Republican candidates for Arizona governor and secretary of state pose a huge risk for democracy because both say they will refuse to certify election results if they don\u2019t like the results. Cheney, a prominent critic of former PresidentDonald Trumpand one of just 10 U.S. House Republicans who voted to impeach him after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, made the comments at an event organized by the McCain Institute at Arizona State University. Cheney also leveled broadsides as what she said was a growing \u201cPutin wing\u201d of the Republican Party who want America to withdraw from the world stage and refuse to defend freedom in other countries. She has spent a lot of time thinking about Arizona and the upcoming elections here. \u201cIn Arizona today you have a candidate for governor in Kari Lake, you have a candidate for Secretary of State in Mark Finchem, both of whom have said \u2014 this isn\u2019t a surprise, it\u2019s not a secret \u2014 they both said that they will only honor the results of an election if they agree with it,\u201d Cheney told the audience filled with ASU students. She said both looked at Trump\u2019s 2020 loss in Arizona, and both know that it was carried out following state law, and that there were counts, recounts, audits and court challenges that all went against Trump. \u201cThey\u2019ve looked at all of that, the law, the facts and the rulings, the courts, and they\u2019ve said it doesn\u2019t matter to them,\u201d Cheney said. \u201cAnd if you care about democracy, and you care about the survival of our republic, then you need to understand, we all have to understand, that we cannot give people power who have told us that they will not honor elections.\u201d Cheney, who is vice chair of theHouse committeeinvestigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on Congress and was trounced in Wyoming\u2019s Republican primary as a result of her refusal to back Trump, spoke of what she believes is a wider threat to the nation from aRepublican Party that is now fully in Trump\u2019s control. \u201cThe first thing that we have to understand is that we\u2019ve never been where we are,\u201d Cheney said. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been in a phase, a place where we\u2019re facing this kind of a threat. And that\u2019s because we\u2019re facing a threat from a former president who is attempting to unravel the Republic.\u201d Cheney, daughter of former Republican Vice President Dick Cheney, spoke of how 30 years ago she worked overseas for the International Republican Institute when former Arizona Sen, John McCain chaired the group\u2019s board. She said she saw firsthand how fragile some of those democracies were. \u201cAnd I think I knew on some level that even in the United States this was fragile,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I certainly didn\u2019t understand just how fragile. I think that\u2019s such an important lesson that we need to take from history.\u201d Cheney, who said her first vote was for Ronald Reagan and is a traditional conservative Republican who favors low taxes and international engagement by the United States, also took shots at Fox News Channel. The issue came up after she was asked by the moderator, McCain Institute Democracy Fellow Sofia Gross, about the meaning of patriotism. Cheney said being a patriot means loving country more than whatever political party someone belongs to. \u201cAnd that means that you put your love of country above politics, you put it above your political career,\u201d she said.

    "Detained Iranian-American, 85, leaves Iran for major surgery": [
        "By MATTHEW LEE and JON GAMBRELLOctober 6, 2022 GMT",
        " DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 An 85-year-old Iranian-American detained for six years in Iran on what the U.S. says were specious espionage charges left the country and was flown to Oman and then to the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday for urgent medical treatment. A lawyer for Baquer Namazi\u2019s family and the Omani government confirmed his arrival in Muscat. Iran\u2019s state-run IRNA news agency published video of Namazi boarding a Royal Oman air force jet in Tehran and later Omani state TV aired video of his arrival in Muscat. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday evening that Namazi had been reunited with his family in Abu Dhabi and would soon receive treatment. Namazi\u2019s release is the first of an American by Iran since President Joe Biden took office, although his son, Siamak, 50, and several other Americans remain in Iranian custody. Baquer Namazi\u2019s release on humanitarian grounds, which was brokered by the United Nations, comes as talkshave stalledon reviving the tattered 2015 Iran nuclear deal with world powers. Jared Genser, a Washington-based lawyer representing the Namazi family, shared a photo of Namazi on the plane in a suit and tie. \u201cToday is a good day for the Namazi family, but the work is far from over,\u201d Genser said in a statement. \u201cWe now need the United States and Iran to act expeditiously to reach an agreement that will finally bring all of the American hostages home.\u201d In addition to Siamak Namazi, there are at least three other Americans still held by Iran. After a brief stop in Oman, Namazi will undergo a procedure at the local branch of the Cleveland Clinic in Abu Dhabi to clear a severe blockage to his left internal carotid artery, Genser said. That blockage put Namazi at high risk of a stroke. Blinken said: \u201cBaquer has asked that we convey his deepest thanks to all of those who worked so tirelessly to secure his release. I add my own gratitude for all of the friends and partners who helped bring about his freedom. \u201cIn particular, we thank the Sultanate of Oman, which worked with Iranian authorities to arrange for his flight out of the country, and the United Arab Emirates, which is generously hosting him and his family during his medical treatment,\u201d he added. Namazi is a former UNICEF official who served as governor of Iran\u2019s oil-rich Khuzestan province under the U.S.-backed shah. He was arrested in 2016, apparently drawn to Iran over fears about his incarcerated son detained in 2015. He was placed under house arrest for medical reasons in 2018 but prevented from leaving Iran despite his family\u2019s pleas that he travel to receive emergency heart surgery after suffering multiple hospitalizations. Last October, he underwent surgery in Iran to clear a blockage in an artery to the brain that his family and supporters described as life-threatening. Security forces arrested his son, Siamak Namazi, an advocate of closer ties between Iran and the West, while he was visiting Iran on a business trip. Both Namazis were sentenced to 10 years in prison in Iran on what the U.S. and U.N. say were trumped-up spying charges. The U.N.\u2019s Working Group on Arbitrary Detention dismissed the cases against the two men, saying in 2017 their case is part of \u201can emerging pattern involving the arbitrary deprivation of liberty of dual nationals.\u201d \u201cThere is no evidence either Mr. S. Namazi or Mr. B. Namazi had a criminal record, including in relation to national security offenses,\u201d their report read. \u201cThere is nothing to indicate that they have ever acted against the national interests of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\u201d ___ Lee reported from Washington.",

    "Senators call for stronger rules on off-the-books suspension": [
        "By ANNIE MAOctober 5, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Two Democratic senators urged the Education Department on Wednesday to strengthen regulations against quietlyexcluding kids from class because of behaviors related to a disability\u2014 a practice known as informal removal. Since the pandemic began, parents of kids with disabilities say the practice is on the rise, denying their kids the legal right to an education. Disability rights advocates and legal experts say the removals likely circumvent protections for these children, who are not supposed to be disciplined because of their disability. In a report Tuesday, The Associated Press and The Hechinger Report documented the impact of these informal removals on children and families. Ininterviews with 20 families in 10 states, parents said they were called repeatedly, sometimes less than an hour into the school day, to pick up their children. Some said they left work so frequently they lost their jobs. The Education Department says it\u2019s seen an increase in informal removal. In May, the department said it intended to strengthen protections for students with disabilities. Officials are considering regulatory amendments to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which protects people from being discriminated against based on their disability. The department also issued guidance to schools in July advising against discriminatory practices in discipline for students with disabilities. That guidance defined informal removals as an action taken by school staff in response to a child\u2019s behavior that removes the child for part or all of the school day, or even indefinitely. In their letter Wednesday to the Education Department, U.S. Sens. Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, both from Illinois, urged that practice be formally defined in regulation and included as a form of prohibited, discriminatory action. \u201cInformal removals not only restrict children\u2019s personal growth and decrease their likelihood of graduating, but they also are discriminatory,\u201d the letter said. \u201cFederal and state laws and regulations, including Section 504, were intended to eliminate the segregation of students with disabilities.\u201d Federal law protects students from being repeatedly taken out of the classroom for disability-related behaviors. After 10 suspensions, families of disabled children are entitled to a review of whether the behaviors are a result of the child\u2019s disability. If so, schools are supposed to make adjustments, such as providing additional accommodations or considering a change in placement. But when the removals are not recorded, those protections are not always triggered, and families may not know they have recourse. The department\u2019s July guidance made clear students who are informally removed have the same rights as those who are officially suspended, including to the review process. \u201cThe \u2018informal removal\u2019 of students with disabilities is a pernicious and dangerous practice that the Office for Civil Rights has seen arise with increasing frequency,\u201d the Department of Education said Wednesday in a statement. \u201cAll students have the right to an education free from discrimination.\u201d The senators noted formal removals, such as documented suspensions and expulsions, lead to a loss of 11 million instructional hours per year. Many schools have promised to cut down on suspensions, since kids can\u2019t learn as well when they aren\u2019t in class. But because informal removals are not recorded, the full scope of their impact on children remains unclear. \u201cIn some cases, informal removals may result in students with disabilities missing months and even years of classroom instruction,\u201d the senators wrote. \u201cMissing school also deprives children of other important services, such as access to free lunch, referrals to outside services, medical care, evaluation services, access to a library and playground, extracurricular activities, and a sense of community and belonging.\u201d ___ Parents, has your child been removed from class, especially because of a disability?

    "Georgia\u2019s Warnock outraises Walker as giving to Kemp jumps": [
        "By JEFF AMYOctober 5, 2022 GMT",
        " ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Democratic U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock is maintaining his cash leadin Georgia over Republican challenger Herschel Walker,while incumbent GOP Gov. Brian Kemp\u2019s fundraising sharply accelerated over the summer in his race with Democratic challenger Stacey Abrams. Walker said Wednesday that his campaign raised more than $12 million in the three months ending Sept. 30, giving him almost $33 million since he began his campaign. Walker\u2019s campaign said that\u2019s the most of any Republican candidate this cycle. Walker spent almost $11 million during the third quarter, leaving him with about $7 million on hand. Despite Walker\u2019s strongest fundraising quarter to date, he lags far behind Warnock, who has become one of the Senate\u2019s most prolific fundraisers. Republican strategists in Washington, however, said planned spending by party committees and GOP-aligned PACs will keep Republicans\u2019 overall Senate advertising in Georgia on par with Warnock and the Democrats ahead of Election Day on Nov. 8. Warnock reported raising $26.3 million in the quarter that ended Sept. 30. He\u2019s now raised about $90 million since winning one of two 2021 runoffs, along with Georgia Democrat Jon Ossoff, that gave their party control of the Senate. Warnock reported $13.7 million in cash on hand. He\u2019s been spending heavily, laying out nearly $35 million in the three-month period. Warnock is one of severalDemocratic Senate incumbents in swing stateswho is trying to cling to their seat amid President Joe Biden\u2019s unpopularity. Warnock, also pastor of the church once led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., said he collected from more than 340,000 individual donors in the period. \u201cTens of thousands of grassroots donors are helping to propel our campaign across the finish line in November because they see the clear choice they have between Reverend Warnock and Herschel Walker,\u201d Warnock campaign manager Quentin Fulks said in a statement. Walker said he received money from \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of donors. His campaign has said hisfundraising has remained strongthis week even after an explosive report that he oncepaid for a woman\u2019s abortion despite taking a strict anti-abortion stancein his campaign. The report led Walker\u2019s son to condemn him publicly. Walker has denied the report while but also argues that he\u2019s been redeemed for past misdeeds. \u201cThe people are so fired up for a new warrior in Washington that they have literally put their money where their mouths are,\u201d Walker said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re so grateful for your support, and can\u2019t wait to return this seat to you, the people.\u201d The 2022 races in closely divided Georgia show how pricey it\u2019s gotten to compete in what has quickly become the South\u2019s premier battleground state. Hundreds of millions in political spending is pouring out from candidates, political parties and outside groups in the governor\u2019s race andthe U.S. Senate race. While outside spending talking about Warnock is roughly balanced, with $6.9 million for and $6.6 million against the incumbent, according to Federal Election Commission records, outside spending focused on Walker has been much more negative, with $14.3 million against and only $2.6 million for the challenger. Warnock became Georgia\u2019s first Black U.S. senator after winning a special election in 2020 to fill the unexpired term ofRepublican Sen. Johnny Isakson, who stepped down because of failing health. Isakson died in December. Kemp on Wednesday announced that he\u2019d taken in $28.7 million for his campaign and an associated leadership committee that can accept unlimited donations over three months. The Republicanis trying to keep pace with the amounts of cash thatDemocrat Stacey Abramshas been hauling in. It\u2019s a much stronger performance than the $6.8 million Kemp collected in the two months ended June 30, pushing his total raised to nearly $60 million. It\u2019s also more than the $22.4 million he raised in his entire run against Abrams in 2018. Kemp said his campaign and his Georgians First committee had $15.4 million in cash left for the five-week sprint to the Nov. 8 election, after spending nearly $20 million from July through September. Abrams must report her totals later this week. She raised $21.8 million during the two months ending June 30, having collected $49 million by that point. ___ Associated Press reporter Bill Barrow contributed. ___ Follow Jeff Amy on Twitter athttp://twitter.com/jeffamy",

    "Drug companies in opioid crisis donated $27K to Ohio\u2019s Ryan": [
        "By JULIE CARR SMYTHOctober 5, 2022 GMT",
        " COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Democratic U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan, who has made his opponent\u2019s questionable record fighting the opioid epidemic a central theme of his campaign for Ohio\u2019s open U.S. Senate seat, has received campaign donations over the years from drug distributors blamed for key roles in the crisis, an Associated Press review found. The contributions to Ryan from AmerisourceBergen, McKesson and Dublin, Ohio-based Cardinal Health, the three biggest drug distribution companies in the U.S., came in between 2007 and August of this year. Earlier this year, the companies finalizeda $21 billion settlementwith state, local and Native American tribal governments and others over the toll of the opioid crisis. The settlement is the largest over opioid claims and keeps the companies from facing thousands of lawsuits. The trio\u2019s combined giving to Ryan of $27,000 represents a fraction of the $50 million he has collected over the course of his career. Still, contributions from those donors are notable as Ryan hammers the spotty record of the anti-opioid nonprofit started by his Republican opponent, \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d author JD Vance. Ryan\u2019s campaign spokesperson called him \u201cone of Congress\u2019 most outspoken fighters against the opioid epidemic.\u201d She noted that Cardinal is a major Ohio employer and the companies\u2019 donations represent just one-fifth of 1% of the $17 million Ryan raised this quarter alone. Vance\u2019s nonprofit, Our Ohio Renewal, spent far more than that \u201cfor political polling and consultant fees to his top political advisor \u2014 when it wasn\u2019t promoting a Purdue Pharma-linked doctor with a reputation for downplaying the deadly threat of OxyContin,\u201d spokesperson Izzi Levy said. Vance\u2019s campaign said accepting the donations represented \u201cshameless hypocrisy\u201d by Ryan. It had not yet reported its latest fundraising figures Wednesday. Ryan and Vance are locked in a tight contest for the coveted open Senate seatbeing vacatedby retiring Republican Sen. Rob Portman. Republicans see the seat as a critical one to hold if they hope to retake the Senate, while a flip to Democrats would be a major victory in the increasingly conservative-leaning state. The distributor most generous to Ryan was from Cardinal Health Inc., a multinational health care services company headquartered in his home state. The company\u2019s PAC has given him $21,000 since 2007, including $5,000 this August. McKesson Corp. Employees PAC gave Ryan $5,000 in 2012. Amerisource Bergen Corp. PAC gave him $1,000 in 2019. The opioid crisis was ongoing during all those years. The three companies\u2019 PACs have donated nearly $10.8 million combined to a wide range of candidates across the country since 2007, according to campaign finance figures compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. About $4.5 million of that went to Democrats, and the other roughly $6.2 million went to Republicans. Vance\u2019s campaign has not received any donations from the PACs. Ryan\u2019s early ads called Vance\u2019s Our Ohio Renewal a \u201csham\u201d that \u201cdidn\u2019t fund a single addiction program\u201d to fight the crisis, but rather backed efforts that \u201cmade it worse.\u201d A second ad featuredan August Associated Press articledetailing a residency the nonprofit organized for an addiction doctor with links to Purdue Pharma, the manufacturer of OxyContin. Vance has said that he did not know about the addiction doctor\u2019s ties to Purdue Pharma, but that he \u201cremains proud of her work to treat patients, especially those in an area of Ohio who needed it most.\u201d Ryan\u2019s campaign said the congressman had helped bring funding to health care providers and law enforcement officials working to fight opioids and had worked to expand access to treatment for residents with substance abuse issues. \u201cTim Ryan has a proven record of working across the aisle to combat this epidemic,\u201d campaign spokesperson Levy said in a statement. During the same years that the now-shuttered Our Ohio Renewal was operating in southern Ohio, Ryan was casting votes in Congress on a host of bills aimed at tackling various elements of the opioid crisis \u2014 sometimes for, sometimes against. He voted overwhelmingly in support of such efforts \u2014 including co-sponsoring the INTERDICT Actpraised by President Donald Trumpfor allocating $15 million to beef up illegal drug screenings on the southern border. But Ryan also opposed several measures aimed at addressing opioid enforcement and addiction, the AP review found. Those included funding packages aimed at providing medical care to address the problem and legislation intended to crack down on illegal fentanyl trafficking. Levy said the congressman had policy objections to aspects of those bills. Ryan also missed a vote in 2020 on legislation extending the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s temporary order listing fentanyl-related substances as Schedule 1 controlled substances. Levy said he was attending a family funeral on that day. __ Geoff Mulvihill in Cherry Hill, N.J., contributed to this report.",

    "Experts: Russia finding new ways to spread propaganda videos": [
        "By DAVID KLEPPEROctober 5, 2022 GMT",
        " Russia has devisedyet another wayto spread disinformation about itsinvasion of Ukraine, using digital tricks that allow itswarpropaganda videos to evade restrictions imposed by governments and tech companies. Accounts linked to Russian state-controlled media have used the new method to spread dozens of videos in 18different languages, all without leaving telltale signs that would give away the source, researchers at Nisos, a U.S.-based intelligencefirm that tracks disinformationand other cyber threats, said in areport released Wednesday. The videos push Kremlin conspiracy theories blaming Ukraine for civilian casualties as well as claims that residents ofareas forcibly annexed by Russiahave welcomed their occupiers. English-language versions of the Russian propaganda videos are now circulating on Twitter and lesser-known platforms popular with American conservatives, including Gab and Truth Social, created by former President Donald Trump,giving Russia a direct conduit to millions of people. In an indication of the Kremlin\u2019s ambitions and thesprawling reachof itsdisinformation operations, versions of the videos were also created in Spanish, Italian, German and more than a dozen other languages. \u201cThe genius of this approach is that the videos can be downloaded directly from Telegram and it erases the trail that researchers try to follow,\u201d Nisos\u2019 senior intelligence analyst Patricia Bailey told The Associated Press. \u201cThey are creative and adaptable. And they are analyzing their audience.\u201d The European Union moved toban RT and Sputnik, two of Russia\u2019s leading state-run media outlets, after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in late February. Tech companies such as Google\u2019s YouTube and Meta\u2019s Facebook and Instagram also announced they wouldban content from the outletswithin the 27-nation EU, undermining Russia\u2019s ability to spread its propaganda. Russian attempts to get around the new rules began almost immediately. New websites were created to host videos that make debunked claims about the war.Russian diplomats took on some of the work. The latest effort revealed by analysts at Nisos involved uploading propaganda videos to Telegram, a loosely moderated platform that is broadly popular in Eastern Europe and used by many conservatives in the United States. In some cases, watermarks identifying the video as RT\u2019s were removed in a further attempt to disguise their source. Once on Telegram, the videos were downloaded and reposted on platforms including Twitter without any labels or other indications that the video was produced by Russian state media. Hundreds of accounts that later posted or reposted the videos were linked by Nisos researchers to the Russian military, embassies or state media. Some of the accounts appeared to use fake profile photos or posted content in strange ways that suggested they were inauthentic. One example: a Twitter account supposedly run by a woman living in Japan that had a singular interest in Russian propaganda. Instead of posting about a variety of topics such as entertainment, food, travel or family, the account user only posted Russian propaganda videos \u2014 and not just in Japanese, but also in Farsi, Polish, Spanish and Russian. The account also cited or reposted content from Russian embassies hundreds of times, researchers found, showing again the close relationship between Russian diplomats and the country\u2019s propaganda work. When it comes to Russia\u2019s overall disinformation capabilities, Bailey said, the network is \u201cjust one piece of a puzzle that is quite large.\u201d Twitter labels content that it can identify as coming from Russian state media. Since late February, the company says it\u2019s added labels to more than 900,000 different Tweets that contained links to Russian state outlets like RT. In addition, the platform does not artificially promote content from state media accounts. \u201cWe use labels to make it clear on Twitter when an account is operated by a state actor, such as a state-backed media outlet, and we will not recommend or amplify Tweets from these types of accounts,\u201d a company spokesperson told The AP. More examples of Russian disinformation campaigns have emerged as the war has dragged on. Last week, Russiasought to spread a baseless conspiracy theoryblaming the U.S. for sabotage to the Nord Stream natural gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea. The same week, Meta announced the discovery of asprawling Russian disinformation networkthat created websites designed to look like major European news outlets. Instead of news, the websites carried propaganda intended to drive a wedge between Ukraine and its western allies. That operation was the largest of its kind to originate in Russia since the war began, researchers concluded. \u201cThe network exhibited an overarching pattern of targeting Europe with anti-Ukraine narratives and expressions of support for Russian interests,\u201d according to a report from the Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Research Lab, which helped identify the network disabled by Meta. ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

        "By ANDREW WELSH-HUGGINSOctober 5, 2022 GMT",
        " COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) \u2014Ohio\u2019s Republican elections chiefon Wednesday announced a new public integrity unit in response to what he called Americans\u2019 \u201ccrisis of confidence\u201d in the electoral process even while acknowledging the state\u2019s reputation for secure voting. The unit, taking effect next week, will consolidate and highlight the Ohio secretary of state\u2019s investigative work and eventually have one or more dedicated investigator, Secretary of State Frank LaRose said in a statement. Those investigators won\u2019t start until after the General Election, however. He referenced a growing national trend \u201cthat indicates a crisis of confidence in the electoral process.\u201d That crisis is largely a concern of Republican voters and stemsfrom lies told by former President Donald Trumpabout election fraud in the campaign won by Joe Biden. Numerous federal and local election officials in both parties, a long list of courts, top former campaign staffers and even Trump\u2019s own attorney general have all said there is no evidence of the election fraud the former president alleges. For his part, LaRose initially said the 2020 election was secure and accurate, but as last spring\u2019s primary neared \u2014 which LaRose won, defeating a 2020 election skeptic \u2014 he began to echo some of Trump\u2019s talking points. LaRose claimed there were problems in other states and touted his office\u2019s work to combat voter fraud. Trump endorsed LaRose, a longtime supporter. LaRose said his new division will help his office more efficiently and thoroughly do work it already does, such as voting system certification and investigation of election law violations, including a team dedicated at looking intorare cases of voter fraudor suppression and campaign finance violations, said LaRose, who is seeking a second term in November. \u201cOur elections are being scrutinized like never before, and any lack of absolute confidence in the accuracy and honesty of those elections weakens the very foundation of our democracy,\u201d LaRose said in a statement. He also referred to Ohio\u2019s \u201cstrong national reputation for secure, accurate, and accessible elections.\u201d LaRose\u2019s announcement follows a decision in Florida in which lawmakers and Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis created apolice force dedicated to pursuing voter fraudand other election crimes. Democrats called LaRose\u2019s news a waste of taxpayer dollars aimed at bolstering his political aspirations. LaRose\u2019s name is often mentioned as a possible 2024 U.S. Senate candidate. LaRose identified just a single case of possible illegal voting earlier this year, said party spokesperson Matt Keyes, making the new office \u201ca taxpayer-funded solution to a problem that doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d Chelsea Clark, LaRose\u2019s Democratic opponent, questioned the timing of the announcement. She also noted LaRose\u2019s efforts to keep his other opponent, independent candidate Terpeshore Maras, off the ballot. Clark called out LaRose for a \u201chistory of politicizing these investigations to punish opponents.\u201d Maras is a conservative podcaster who embraces Trump\u2019s lies about the 2020 election. Last month, the Ohio Supreme Courtruled her eligibleto run for Ohio secretary of state this fall. In August, LaRose\u2019s office had upheld a judge\u2019s decision that a number of Maras\u2019 petition signatures were invalid, andinvalidated her candidacy,a move overturned by the state Supreme Court. Maras dismissed the move as pre-election posturing. If elected, she wouldn\u2019t need such a unit, because \u201ceveryone employed in our office already has some delegated part in ensuring each Ohioan has a single secure vote that is properly counted \u2013 nothing more and nothing less,\u201d Maras said. ___ Associated Press Writer Kantele Franko in Columbus contributed to this report.",

    "EXPLAINER: Tax cut trend reaches two-thirds of states": [
        "By DAVID A. LIEBOctober 5, 2022 GMT",
        " JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) \u2014 States brimming with cash are cutting taxes at a rapid pace. With the enactment Wednesday of an income tax cut in Missouri, about two-thirds of U.S. states have adopted some sort of tax relief in 2022. For taxpayers, the trend means billions of dollars back in their pockets. Some already have received rebate checks. Others, like those in Missouri, will realize their tax savings over several years. One-time rebates \u2014 typically totaling several hundred dollars per taxpayer \u2014 have been more common in Democratic-led states, though some Republican-led states also have provided refunds. Many Republican-led states have instead opted for permanent income tax rate reductions, sometimes phased in. In such cases, workers might notice a gradual reduction in the amount of taxes withheld from their paychecks \u2014 and potentially get a refund when they file their annual income tax returns. Here\u2019s a look atthe tax-cutting trendacross the U.S. BUDGET SURPLUSES Economic shutdowns at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic triggered sharp revenue declines for many states in 2020. But those losses turned out to be short-lived. As the economy recovered, state tax revenues came roaring back. At the same time, the federal government provided billions of dollars of pandemic relief funds to taxpayers, which helped boost consumer spending. The federal government also provided billions of dollars of aid directly to states, further bolstering their finances. The 2022 fiscal year, which ended June 30 for most states, marked the second straight year of large growth in tax collections. Many states reported their largest-ever surpluses, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers. That allowed states toenact tax cuts and rebates, even while increasing spending on government programs and services. TAX RELIEF TRENDS At least 33 states have approved some form of tax relief this year. Income tax rate cuts have passed in 14 states. All have Republican-controlled legislatures except New York, where Democrats who hold poweraccelerated a previously approved tax rate reduction. At least 15 states have approved one-time rebates from their surpluses, including 10 led by Democratic governors and legislatures, four by Republicans and one \u2014 Virginia \u2014 with split partisan control. In addition to general income tax cuts and rebates, some states have approved targeted tax breaks for families or retirees. Others have cut sales taxes on food or suspended gas taxes to help offset the effects of inflation. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed an order Mondayextending the state\u2019s gas tax suspension another month, until after the Nov. 8 election. Kemp estimates the state already has forgone about $800 million in gas tax revenue, which benefits roads. He plans to backfill that by using some of the state\u2019s $6.6 billion surplus. MISSOURI TAX CUT While signingthe income-tax-cut legislationWednesday, Missouri Gov. Mike Parson said the estimated $760 million reduction, when fully phased in, will be \u201cthe largest tax cut in the state\u2019s history.\u201d Under previous law, Missouri\u2019s top individual income tax rate already was scheduled to fall from 5.3% to 5.2% in January, with the potential to gradually drop to 4.8% if revenue-growth triggers were met in future years. The new law will cut the tax rate to 4.95% in January and exempt the first $1,000 of income from taxation. The tax rate could drop to 4.8% as soon as 2024, if state tax revenue grows by at least $175 million over the high mark of the previous three years. Missouri\u2019s new law also authorizes three additional annual tax cuts that could eventually reduce the tax rate to 4.5%. Each reduction would occur only if state revenue grows by an inflation-adjusted $200 million over the high mark of the previous three years while also exceeding an inflation-adjusted baseline. Parson said the cuts amount to a 5% reduction in people\u2019s taxes. The nonprofit Missouri Budget Project estimates that a household earning $30,000 annually would save $17 next year, and $29 once the law is fully phased in. For a household earning $152,000 annually, first-year savings would be $348 and eventual savings would reach $759. Parson also signed a law Wednesday authorizing $40 million of annual agricultural tax breaks benefitting meat processing facilities, urban farmers and biofuel retailers, among others. TAX CUT HESITANCY Some states have bucked the tax-cutting trend. Politically divided government has made agreement difficult among Republicans and Democrats in such states as Minnesota and Wisconsin. But tax relief also has failed in some entirely Republican-led states. A Republican effort to call a special session of the Montana Legislature to provide tax rebates failed to draw enough support in September. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican, called the GOP-led state Legislature into a special session in June \u2014 and again in September \u2014 to consider a sales tax cut for groceries and a reduction in the individual income tax rate. But lawmakersadjourned without passing anything. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican, also called lawmakers into special session this summer to consider an income tax cut. But the Republican-led Legislature has not passed it. GOP Senate leaders instead have proposed to cut personal property taxes. In November, voters will decide on a constitutional amendment that would allow lawmakers to eliminate property taxes on business equipment and inventory. Justice has spoken against the proposal, saying it could harm schools and counties that rely on property taxes. BALLOT PROPOSALS Despite recent tax rebates, voters in some states will be considering ballot measures this November to increase taxes for certain purposes. California provided rebatesbetween $200 and $1,050 this year to individuals earning less than $250,000 annually and households earning less than $500,000. A proposition going before voters would impose an additional 1.75% tax on personal income over $2 million, with the proceeds to fund electric vehicle initiatives and wildfire prevention. Soaring tax collections in Massachusetts havetriggered a decades-old lawthat will return more than $2.9 billion to taxpayers, with refund checks expected to begin in November. That same month, voters will consider a proposed tax increase on incomes over $1 million to benefit education, public transportation and roads. Colorado accelerated the payment of a constitutionally mandated rebate of $750 per individual and $1,500 for couples this year. The checks arrived before a fall election in which voters will weigh a pair of ballot measures \u2014 one cutting the income tax rate from 4.55% to 4.4%, the other increasing taxes on income over $300,000 to benefit school meal programs. ___ Follow David A.

    "GOP optimistic about Senate chances despite Walker turmoil": [
        "By STEVE PEOPLESOctober 5, 2022 GMT",
        " NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Leading Republicans are entering the final month of themidtermcampaign increasingly optimistic that a Senate majority is within reach even as a dramatic family fight in Georgia clouds one of the party\u2019s biggest pickup opportunities. And as some Democrats crow on social media about apparent Republican setbacks, party strategists privately concede that their own shortcomings may not be outweighed by the GOP\u2019s mounting challenges. The evolving outlook is tied to a blunt reality: Democrats have virtually no margin for error as they confront the weight of history, widespread economic concerns and PresidentJoe Biden\u2019sweak standing. There is broad agreement among both parties that the Democrats\u2019 summertime momentum across states like Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin has eroded just five weeks before Election Day. \u201cThere\u2019s reason to be apprehensive, not reason to be gloomy,\u201d veteran Democratic strategist James Carville said. \u201cIt looked like at the end of August we had a little momentum. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve regressed any, but we\u2019re not progressing in many places.\u201d That tepid outlook comes even as Republicans confront a series of self-imposed setbacks in the states that matter most in the 2022 midterms, which will decide the balance of power in Congress and statehouses across the nation. None has been more glaring than Herschel Walker\u2019s struggles in Georgia, where the Republican Senate candidate\u2019s own son accused him of lying about his personal challenges \u2014 including areportfrom The Daily Beast alleging that the anti-abortion Walker paid for a girlfriend\u2019s abortion in 2009. Walker called the accusation a \u201cflat-out lie\u201d and said he would sue. Walker had not taken legal action as of late Tuesday, but he repeated his denials Wednesday morning during a Fox News interview, even as he talked generally of a difficult past as a husband and father. Shown an image of the \u201cget well\u201d card the Daily Beast reported that he sent to the girlfriend \u2014 which was signed with an \u201cH,\u201d not his full signature \u2014 Walker said, he doesn\u2019t sign cards with just an initial. The Republican establishment, including the Sen. Mitch McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund, and former President Donald Trump himself remained staunchly behind Walker on Tuesday in his bid to oust first-term Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock. A Walker campaign adviser said the candidate has raised at least $500,000 since he first responded publicly to The Daily Beast report. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a fight, people will come to your aid,\u201d said Steven Law, head of the Senate Leadership Fund and a close ally of McConnell, R-Ky. Law said the Georgia race had grown increasingly competitive despite the Democrats\u2019 focus on Walker\u2019s personal life. And looking beyond Georgia, Law said the political climate was predictably shifting against the party that controls the White House, as is typically the case in midterm elections. \u201cIt certainly seems that voters are returning to a more traditional midterm frame of mind,\u201d Law said. Should Republicans gain even one Senate seat in November, they would take control of Congress\u2019 upper chamber \u2014 and with it, the power to control judicial nominations and policy debates for the last two years of Biden\u2019s term. Leaders in both parties believe Republicans are likely to take over the House. Even facing such odds, it\u2019s far too soon to predict a Republican-controlled Congress. Democrats remain decidedly on offense and are spending heavily to try to flip Republican-held seats in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and North Carolina. Voter opposition to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision this summer to strip women of their constitutional right to an abortion has energized the Democratic base and led to a surge in female voter registrations. Republicans are most focused on Democratic incumbents in Arizona, Georgia, New Hampshire and Nevada, although Republican officials believe that underwhelming Trump-backed nominees in Arizona and New Hampshire have dampened the party\u2019s pickup opportunities. \u201cThe Republican candidates they\u2019re running are too extreme,\u201d said J.B. Poersch, who leads the pro-Democrat Senate Majority PAC. \u201cI think this is still advantage Democrats.\u201d Meanwhile, conditions in the top battleground states are rapidly evolving. In Pennsylvania, Republican Senate nominee Mehmet Oz faced difficult new questions this week raised by a Washington Post article about the medical products he endorsed as a daytime television star. Another news report by the news site Jezebel detailing how his research caused hundreds of dogs to be killed rippled across social media. Still, Democratic officials acknowledge the race tightened considerably as the calendar shifted to October. And while there is disagreement within the White House, some officials there are concerned about Democratic nominee John Fetterman\u2019s stamina as he recovers from a May stroke. \u201cSenate Republicans had a very bad start to October, but we know each of our races will be tight and we\u2019re going to keep taking nothing for granted,\u201d said Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, who leads the Senate Democrats\u2019 campaign arm. The GOP Senate candidates\u2019 latest challenges in Georgia and Pennsylvania dominated social media Monday and Tuesday, according to data compiled by GQR, a public opinion research firm that works with Democratic organizations. News stories about Walker\u2019s abortion accuser and Oz\u2019s animal research had the first- and second-highest reach of any news stories on Facebook and Twitter since they surfaced Monday, topping content related to the television show \u201cSons of Anarchy,\u201d another report about Planned Parenthood mobile abortion clinics and news about Kanye West. GQR used the social listening tool NewsWhip, which tracks over 500,000 websites in more than 100 languages roughly in real time. In swing-state Nevada, the rhetoric from Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto has become increasingly urgent in recent days as she fends off a fierce challenge from former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt. Within the White House, there is real fear that she could lose her reelection bid, giving Republicans the only seat they may need to claim the Senate majority. \u201cWe have a big problem, friend,\u201d Cortez Masto wrote in a fundraising appeal Tuesday. \u201cExperts say that our race in Nevada could decide Senate control \u2014 and right now, polling shows me 1 point behind my Trump-endorsed opponent.\u201d Democrats and their allies continue to hope that backlash against the Supreme Court\u2019s abortion decision will help them overcome historical trends in which the party controlling the White House almost always loses seats in Congress. Democrats, who control Washington, are also facing deep voter pessimism about the direction of the country and Biden\u2019s relatively weak approval ratings. The traditional rules of politics have often been broken in the Trump era. In past years, Republicans may have abandoned Walker. But on Tuesday, they linked arms behind him. Law, of the Senate Leadership Fund, said he takes Walker at his word that he did not pay for a former girlfriend\u2019s abortion, despite apparent evidence of a \u201cGet Well\u201d card with Walker\u2019s signature and a check receipt. He said voters believe that \u201cWalker may have made mistakes in his personal life that affected him and his family, but Warnock has made mistakes in public life in Washington that affected them and their families.\u201d There were some signs of Republican concern on the ground in Georgia, however. Martha Zoller, a popular Republican radio host in north Georgia and one-time congressional candidate, told her audience Tuesday that the latest allegations require Walker to reset his campaign with a straightforward admission about his \u201cpersonal demons\u201d and what he\u2019s done to overcome them. \u201cHe needs to fall on the sword. \u2018I was a dog. ... And I have asked forgiveness for it,\u2019\u201d she said, detailing the kind of message she believes Walker must give voters. \u201cIt would be so refreshing to have somebody just tell the truth.\u201d Walker attempted his version of that strategy Wednesday on Fox News. \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re trying to bring up my past to hurt me,\u201d he said, before quoting Christian New Testament text. \u201cI\u2019m a sinner. We all sin before the glory of God.\u201d Yet Walker insisted his past transgressions don\u2019t include encouraging and paying for an abortion. \u201cEveryone is anonymous, and everyone is leaking, and they want you to confess to something you have no clue about,\u201d he said. Veteran Democratic strategist Josh Schwerin warned his party against writing off the Georgia Republican. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say Walker is done. Over the last couple of cycles we\u2019ve certainly seen Republican candidates survive things that are not supposed to be survivable,\u201d Schwerin said. \u201cThere are a lot of close races, and the dynamics of this election are difficult to predict. Everybody is expecting multiple shifts in momentum between now and Election Day.\u201d ___ Associated Press writers Zeke Miller in Washington and Bill Barrow in Atlanta contributed to this report.",

    "In Wisconsin, Michels\u2019 shift on abortion isn\u2019t 1st reversal": [
        "By SCOTT BAUEROctober 5, 2022 GMT",
        " MADISON, Wis. (AP) \u2014 Republican Tim Michels was talking to a roomful of party activists in early September when he fielded a question about his position on abortion. Michels vowed he would never change, and said he was \u201cwinning\u201d his race against Democratic Gov. Tim Evers precisely because people saw him as \u201ca man of conviction, a man who doesn\u2019t waffle.\u201d Two weeks later,Michels retreated from his unqualified support for Wisconsin\u2019s 1849 lawbanning abortion except to save the life of the mother, saying if elected he would sign legislation to grant exceptions for rape and incest. It wasn\u2019t the first time Michels changed course on a significant issue. Since getting into the race in April, Michels endorsed Donald Trump for a 2024 run, after first declining to support anyone; said the state\u2019s bipartisan election commission should be eliminated, after first saying he wanted to keep it; and began welcoming big-dollar donations after earlier saying he wouldn\u2019t take any larger than $500. Michels and Evers are in a close race with broad implications for national politics in 2024 and beyond.Evers has highlighted his statusas the only barrier to total GOP control, including his vetoes this year of Republican legislation that would have made it more difficult for some voters to cast ballots in the key battleground state. A Michels victory would give the GOP free rein to pass those changes and more. It\u2019s the most expensive governor\u2019s race in the nation in terms of ad spending, with both sides spending about $55 million on TV so far, according to AdImpact Politics, which tracks spending by major campaigns. Michels declined an interview request. But when asked about his change in position at a campaign stop Tuesday, Michels said, \u201cI\u2019ve been very clear and consistent throughout that I am pro-life, and I make no apologies for that.\u201d Michels said he would sign a bill creating abortion exceptions in cases of rape and incest because if the Legislature passes it, that means \u201cthe people have spoken.\u201d It\u2019s not clear whether Michels will pay any price with voters for his evolving position on abortion or other issues. Brandon Scholz, a Republican strategist, said he doubted it. Most voters have already decided whom they support, he said. \u201cThe independents that started in this race after the primary have picked their sides,\u201d Scholz said. \u201cRepublicans have made up their minds on Michels. I don\u2019t see anything out there that would move Republicans to vote for Tony Evers.\u201d That hasn\u2019t stopped Evers from seeking to batter Michelson the abortion issue. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising he would make a last-minute, dishonest attempt to hide his radical record on abortion, education, and more,\u201d Evers said in a statement to The Associated Press. Michels is in his first campaign since an unsuccessful run for U.S. Senate 18 years ago. Barry Burden, a political science professor and director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin, said such candidates \u201cmake mistakes sometimes.\u201d \u201cThey say things that commit then to a position or a path that they eventually don\u2019t want to be on so that creates inconsistencies with their positions as they try to walk back earlier views,\u201d he said. Michels\u2019 abortion shift came after a primary fight where his chief rival, former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, also opposed the rape and incest exceptions. After winning, Michels clearly came under pressure to soften his position, Burden said. A Marquette University Law School poll taken shortly before Michels\u2019 reversal found 83% of respondents \u2014 including 70% of Republicans \u2014 supported exceptions for rape and incest. \u201cAbortion is a little bit of a worrying sign for Republicans as an issue and it might be the only thing that ends up saving some Democrats who are having a tough go of it,\u201d Burden said. To push back, Michels accuses Evers of breaking promises with voters on a variety of issues, including changes in approach to fighting COVID-19 in 2020. He also points out that Evers proposed tax increases, after saying he didn\u2019t intend to raise taxes, and then later took credit for tax cuts passed by the GOP-controlled Legislature that he signed into law. As part of his strategy to make the race about crime and safety, Michels has alsoattacked Eversover his administration paroling people convicted of murder and rape and said that Evers has broken his promise made in 2018 not to release violent offenders. Evers does not determine who is granted parole, something that has occurred routinely under both Republican and Democratic governors for decades. ___ Follow AP for full coverage of the midterms at https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections and on Twitter at https://twitter.com/ap_politics",

    "Can Biden save democracy one US factory job at a time?": [
        "By JOSH BOAKOctober 5, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden is working to create a manufacturing revival \u2014 even helping to put factory jobs in Republican territory under the belief it can restore faith in U.S. democracy. The latest development came Tuesday, when chipmaker Micron announced an investment of up to $100 billion over the next 20-plus yearsto build a plant in upstate New Yorkthat could create 9,000 factory jobs. It\u2019s a commitment made in a GOP congressional district that Biden and the company credited to the recentlyenacted $280 billion CHIPS and Science Act. \u201cToday is another win for America, and another massive new investment in America spurred by my economic plan,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cTogether, we are building an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, where we lower costs for our families and make it right here in America.\u201d Biden has staked his presidency on what he has called \u201ca historic manufacturing boom,\u201d hoping to succeed where past presidents, governors and hordes of other politicians have struggled for a half-century. His goal is to keep opening new factories in states such as Ohio, Idaho, North Carolina and Georgia \u2014 where Democrats\u2019 footholds are shaky at best. Administration officials say they want to spread the prosperity across the entire country, rather than let it cluster in centers of extreme wealth, in a bid to renew the middle class and a sense of pride in the country itself. The push comes at a precarious moment for theglobal economy.High inflationin the U.S. has hurt Biden\u2019s popularity and promptedrecession concerns. Much of Europe faces a possible downturn due to the jump in energy prices after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, while the International Monetary Fund just downgraded growth in China. The world economy is defined by uncertainty just as Biden has called for investments in clean energy and technology that could take years to pay off. The president is hopeful that whatever good manufacturing can do for the U.S. economy also turns out to yield political benefits for himself and other Democrats in 2022 and beyond. He told Democratic donors on Friday that the manufacturing and technology investments mean \u201cwe have an opportunity\u201d to strengthen the U.S. if Democratic governors and lawmakers are elected this year. Going into the midterm elections, Biden is telling voters that a factory renaissance has already started because of him. The administration sees its infrastructure spending, computer chip investments and clean-energy incentives as helping domestic manufacturing in unprecedented ways. Recent academic studies suggest that decades of layoffs due to offshoring contributed to the rise of Republican Donald Trump, with his opposition to immigration and global trade. But many of the authors of the studies doubt that Biden can make these demographic trends disappear through the promise of jobs for skilled workers. Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California would like to see the president make a national tour of factory openings, so that his policies could stick better in voters\u2019 minds. Khanna recently attended the groundbreaking of a $20 billion Intel plant in Ohio and laid out his belief that factory job losses helped cause today\u2019s political schisms. The Silicon Valley congressman reasons that too many Americans have lost faith in a government that seemed indifferent to their own well-being, leading them to embrace hucksters and authoritarians who thrive by exploiting and widening divisions in society. \u201cHow do you get rid of people\u2019s jobs and expect them to believe in democracy?\u201d Khanna asks. Factory jobs have risen during Biden\u2019s tenure to the most since 2008 at 12.85 million, yet the task of steadying the country\u2019s middle class and its democratic institutions is far from complete. The industrial Midwest has yet to recover the factory jobs shed in the pandemic, let alone decades of layoffs in which the economic challenges evolved into political tensions. Labor Department data show that Ohio is still 10,000 factory jobs shy of its pre-pandemic level and 350,000 jobs below its total in 2000. The numbers are similarly bad in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2014 three states that were key to Biden\u2019s 2020 victory and could help decide control of Congress in November\u2019s elections. The White House says Biden eschews thinking about Americans solely as consumers interested only in the cheapest prices and thus promoting outsourcing. Instead, his speeches are woven with talk about people as workers and the identity that working gives them. What Biden can show with this year\u2019s factory groundbreakings is progress, even if the total number of manufacturing jobs is unlikely to return to the 1979 peak of 19.55 million. Intel\u2019s computer chip plant being built in New Albany, Ohio, would add 3,000 jobs. Hyundai would add 8,100 jobs with its electric vehicle plant in Georgia. Wolfspeed, with plans to produce silicon carbide wafers in North Carolina, would add 1,800 jobs. Jay Timmons, CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers, said the gains in factory jobs reflect five years of effort, starting with the 2017 tax cuts by Trump and including Biden\u2019s investments in infrastructure and computer chips as well as efforts to return jobs to the U.S. after global supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic. \u201cThere\u2019s a commitment by government at all levels to do more here and a desire by manufacturers to do more here,\u201d Timmons said. Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Daron Acemoglu applauded the president\u2019s plans for spreading factory work across the country. It\u2019s too soon to tell if the administration is succeeding, he said, but Biden is challenging what was once conventional wisdom among economists that little could be done to expand factory work in the U.S. \u201cI believe the president is right,\u201d said Acemoglu, the co-author of the book \u201cWhy Nations Fail.\u201d \u201c\u2018Good jobs,\u2019 which pay decent wages, have job stability, offer career-addressing opportunities, and endow a sense of accomplishment and dignity, are important for the middle class and social cohesion.\u201d New academic research released in September suggests that the offshoring of factory jobs led white men to feel like victims and gave way to the rise of grievance politics that helped fuel Trump\u2019s ascendancy among Republican voters. That movement in turn spawned election denialism and political violence that Biden has repeatedly said is \u201ca dagger to the throat of our democracy.\u201d The research covering 3,500 U.S. citizens finds that factory job losses due to automation are less controversial among voters than the offshoring, which triggered a \u201cself-victimization bias\u201d for whites who were more likely to \u201cview offshoring as leading to greater total harm to the American economy, and to the U.S. position in the world.\u201d One of the study\u2019s authors, Leonardo Baccini of McGill University, still expects factory job totals to shrink, though a decline primarily due to automation would be less harmful to Democratic candidates. He still anticipates factory job losses over the long term as advanced economies focus more on productive services to sustain growth. \u201cFrom an economic standpoint, the decline of U.S. manufacturing is inevitable and it is actually a good thing,\u201d Baccini said. \u201cAny attempt to stop this structural transformation with protectionism and government subsidies is likely to backfire.\u201d J. Lawrence Broz, a political scientist at the University of California San Diego, co-wrote a 2019 research paper that found populist support was strongest in communities that endured long-term economic and social decline, a contrast to the superstar cities where technology, finance and a highly educated workforce were magnets for wealth. \u201cIt is unlikely that recent efforts to re-shore manufacturing jobs will produce the intended effects, either economically or politically,\u201d Broz said. \u201cThe new factories won\u2019t employ large numbers of less-skilled workers, leaving white industrial workers just as angry as they are now.\u201d That means the underlying test of Biden\u2019s agenda might be whether enough workers can be educated to meet the needs of a manufacturing sector with higher standards than during the heights of its dominance in the 20th century.",

    "Kari Lake walks back \u2018rare and legal\u2019 abortion comment": [
        "By JONATHAN J. COOPEROctober 5, 2022 GMT",
        " PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 A spokesman for Kari Lake said Tuesday the Republican candidate for Arizona governor didn\u2019t mean to suggestabortionshould be legal, saying she\u2019s not calling for changes to abortion laws weeks after a judge ruled thatprosecutors can enforcea near-total ban on terminating pregnancies. In her most expansive comments on abortion since the ruling last month, Lake told a Phoenix talk radio host that it should be \u201crare and legal\u201d before saying twice that it should be \u201crare but safe.\u201d Ross Trumble, a spokesman for Lake, said she meant to say only \u201crare but safe.\u201d \u201cYou know, it would be really wonderful if abortion was rare and legal \u2014 the way they said it before, remember? Rare but safe, rare but safe, I think is what they said,\u201d Lake told conservative host Mike Broomhead on KTAR radio. \u201cIt\u2019d be really wonderful if that\u2019s how it turned out. But that\u2019s not what they want, Mike. They don\u2019t want rare but safe.\u201d Lake appeared to be referring to former President Bill Clinton\u2019s famous line that abortion should be \u201csafe, legal and rare.\u201d Arizona doctors stopped performing abortions late last month after a judge in Tucson ruled that prosecutors can enforce a law dating to 1864 that bans abortion unless it\u2019s necessary to save a woman\u2019s life. Arizona also has a law passed this year that bans abortion after 15 weeks, creating speculation about what\u2019s allowed. Trumble said either the total ban or the 15-week law would fit Lake\u2019s standard of abortion being \u201crare but safe.\u201d \u201c\u2018Rare but safe\u2019 would apply to whatever the current law is interpreted to mean,\u201d Trumble said. He said Lake has no plans to ask the Legislature to change abortion laws and declined to say whether she would sign legislation expanding access, saying he wouldn\u2019t address \u201chypotheticals.\u201d Asked in the radio interview whether she would support allowing abortion in cases of rape and incest \u2014 both are disallowed under the total abortion ban and the 15-week law \u2014 Lake demurred. \u201cThat\u2019s a very small percentage of abortions,\u201d she said. She said her Democratic opponent, Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, has the more extreme position, accusing her of supporting abortion without restrictions. Hobbs says decisions about abortions should be made by women and their doctors without government interference. Lake has spoken positively of Arizona\u2019s total ban on abortion, which she called \u201ca great law that\u2019s already on the books.\u201d She has called abortion \u201cthe ultimate sin,\u201d said abortion pills should be illegal and that she would sign a bill banning abortion as soon as fetal cardiac activity can be detected, usually around six weeks gestational age and before many women know they\u2019re pregnant. Democrats haveseized on the ruling, which revived the issue ahead of next month\u2019s midterm elections. Democratic lawmakers sent a letter on Tuesday asking Republican Gov. Doug Ducey to call a special session of the Legislature to repeal the 1864 abortion ban.",

    "Trump asks Supreme Court to intervene in Mar-a-Lago dispute": [
        "By ERIC TUCKEROctober 4, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Lawyers for former President Donald Trump asked the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday to step into the legal fight over the classified documents seized during anFBI search of his Florida estate, escalating a dispute over the powers of an independent arbiter appointed to inspect the records. The Trump team asked the justices to overturn a lower court ruling and allow the arbiter, called a special master, to review theroughly 100 documents with classification markingsthat were taken in the Aug. 8 search of Mar-a-Lago. A three-judge panel from the Atlanta-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuitlast month limited the special master\u2019s reviewto the much larger tranche of non-classified documents. The judges, including two Trump appointees, sided with the Justice Department, which had argued there was no legal basis for the special master to conduct his own review of the classified records. But Trump\u2019s lawyers said in their application to the Supreme Court that it was essential for the special master to have access to the classified records to \u201cdetermine whether documents bearing classification markings are in fact classified, and regardless of classification, whether those records are personal records or Presidential records.\u201d \u201cSince President Trump had absolute authority over classification decisions during his Presidency, the current status of any disputed document cannot possibly be determined solely by reference to the markings on that document,\u201d the application states. It says that without the special master review, \u201cthe unchallenged views of the current Justice Department would supersede the established authority of the Chief Executive.\u201d An independent review, the Trump team says, ensures a \u201ctransparent process that provides much-needed oversight.\u201d The FBI says it seized roughly 11,000 documents, including about 100 with classification markings, during its search. The Trump team asked a judge in Florida, Aileen Cannon, to appoint a special master to do an independent review of the records. Cannonsubsequently assigned a veteran Brooklyn judge, Raymond Dearie,to review the records and segregate those that may be protected by claims of attorney-client privilege and executive privilege. She also barred the FBI from being able to use the classified documents as part of its criminal investigation. The Justice Department appealed, prompting the 11th Circuit to lift Cannon\u2019s hold on investigators\u2019 ability to scrutinize the classified records. The appeals court also ruled that the department did not have to provide Dearie with access to the classified records. Trump\u2019s lawyers submitted the Supreme Court application to Justice Clarence Thomas, who oversees emergency matters from Florida and several other Southern states. Thomas can act on his own or, as is usually done, refer the emergency appeal to the rest of the court. Late Tuesday the court said the government was being asked to respond to the petition by Oct. 11. Thomas has previouslycome under scrutiny for his votein a different Trump documents case, in which he was the only member of the court to vote againstallowing the U.S. House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riotto obtain Trump records held by the National Archives and Records Administration. Thomas\u2019 wife,Virginia \u201cGinni\u201d Thomas, is a conservative activist and staunch Trump supporter who attended the Jan. 6 \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally on the Ellipse and wrote to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows in the weeks following the election encouraging him to work to overturn Biden\u2019s victory and keep Trump in office. She alsocontacted lawmakers in ArizonaandWisconsinin the weeks after the election. Thomas was recently interviewed by the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection and shestood by the false claim that the 2020 election was fraudulent. ____ Associated Press writers Mark Sherman and Jessica Gresko contributed to this report.

    "Walker report puts abortion back at center of Georgia race": [
        "By BILL BARROWOctober 4, 2022 GMT",
        " ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 In Georgia\u2019s pivotal U.S. Senate race, Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and his Republicanchallenger, Herschel Walker, have each been laboring to cast the other as an extremist on abortion while deflecting questions about the finer points of their own positions. The sidestepping by Warnock, who supports abortion rights, and Walker, who has called for a national ban, reflects the sensitivity of abortion politics in a post-Roe v. Wade America, where the procedure is open to regulation by state governments and,potentially, by Congress. But Walker\u2019s strategy may not work much longer afterThe Daily Beast reported Mondaythat the former University of Georgia and NFL football star encouraged and paid for a girlfriend\u2019s abortion in 2009 \u2014 a blatant contradiction of his staunch claims that there\u2019s \u201cno excuse\u201d for a procedure he characterizes as \u201ckilling.\u201d Walker calls the report a \u201cflat-out lie.\u201d The story propelled the issue of abortion back to the center of the race in the closing weeks of the campaign \u2014 and just ahead ofthe candidates\u2019 Oct. 14 debate. The contest is one of the most consequential in the country this midterm season and could determine which party controls the Senate for the second half of President Joe Biden\u2019s first term in office. Abortion is an issue in other Senate races as well, including Colorado, Florida and North Carolina. The Daily Beast interviewed a woman who identified herself as a former girlfriend of Walker\u2019s and asked that her name not be disclosed out of concerns for her privacy. She provided a receipt indicating she had paid $575 for an abortion, as well as a get-well card from Walker and bank deposit records showing the image of a $700 personal check from Walker dated five days after the abortion receipt. At the least, the report complicates Walker\u2019s effort to use abortion as an issue against Warnock. And it underscores the sometimes-delicate task that confronts other candidates from both major parties who hope to use the issue ahead of the midterm elections. For decades under Roe, Republicans like Walker were able to call themselves \u201cpro-life\u201d and blast \u201cabortion on demand,\u201d perhaps even expressing support for absolute or near-total bans that federal courts were certain to strike down. Democrats, meanwhile, could oppose such Republican efforts as draconian. All sides knew it it would be the Supreme Court, not them, making any ultimate decision. But with the high court in Juneoverturning the 1973 decision legalizing abortion nationwide, the issue has become one of the animating variables of the 2022 midterm campaigns. Themost conservative anti-abortion groups want a national ban, with some going so far as to oppose even exceptions in cases involving rape, incest or health risks to a pregnant woman. Abortion rights group, meanwhile, are reticent to back any limits on abortion access, including later in pregnancy. As a whole, Americans have nuanced views on abortion, though a clear majority support at least some access. A July AP-NORC pollshowed 63% of U.S. adults said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 36% thought it should be illegal in all or most cases. Some 31% said always legal, just 9% illegal in all cases. That leaves politicians to navigate varied opinions across a big swath of Democrats, Republicans and independents. Walker has questioned how Warnock, a pastor, could support abortion rights. \u201cGod told me thou shalt not kill,\u201d he is fond of saying, referring to one of the Ten Commandments in Judeo-Christian holy texts. At a campaign stop in July, he said of Warnock: \u201cWhy is he saying you can have an abortion at nine months?\u201d Why does he \u201cwant to have a young woman kill her baby?\u201d Warnock, for his part, told voters as recently as Monday night that he has both \u201ca profound reverence for life\u201d and \u201can abiding respect for choice,\u201d declaring the government does not belong in a patient\u2019s room. When questioned by reporters for more details, Warnock declines to engage on whether he\u2019d consider any abortion limits as part of reestablishing a national right. Asked last week whether he\u2019d support a federal bill codifying the previous Supreme Court standard \u2014 essentially allowing most elective abortions up to the point a fetus is viable, with states able to place some regulations even before then \u2014 Warnock said, \u201cI think that we\u2019ve got to explore all options to protect this core constitutional principle.\u201d Walker\u2019s clearest support for a total federal abortion ban came when he was running for the GOP Senate nomination. He said \u201cthere\u2019s no exception in my mind\u201d that should allow women to terminate pregnancies resulting from rape or incest or those that threaten their life or health. Last month, however, he endorsed aproposal from Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., to ban abortions nationwideat 15 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions. The support for Graham\u2019s proposal was inconsistent with his previous stance that states should set abortion rules. A 15-week ban also would still allow many elective abortions that conservative anti-abortion groups want to outlaw. Republicans in Washington have not necessarily embraced Graham\u2019s proposal as the party standard. Sen. Rick Scott, the Florida Republican who leads his party\u2019s Senate campaign committee, tried last weekend on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d to leave wiggle room for GOP candidates. \u201cI don\u2019t know if what Lindsey put out changed the conversation, but it is an important issue for the country,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery candidate gets to make their choice.\u201d Scott then illuminated the gray areas in how partisans identify on abortion. He called himself \u201cpro-life\u201d but added that \u201cwe ought to have a reasonable restriction\u201d and that \u201ca lot of people are comfortable with 15 weeks\u201d plus \u201cexceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother.\u201d Democrats, meanwhile, have largely been eager to keep abortion front of mind heading into the midterms. Biden has promised to codify abortion rights into federal law, saying he needs voters to send two more Democratic senators to Washington to make it happen. Warnock and Walker are not the only Senate candidates walking a tightrope on abortion. Scott\u2019s Florida colleague, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, touts his personal opposition to abortion in all cases but has also said he\u2019d back abortion-restricting statutes that include exceptions. Rubio also has avoided taking a specific stance on any federal restrictions, saying the issue is more appropriately settled state-by-state. Rubio\u2019s opponent, Rep. Val Demings, has said she supports abortion access at least until fetal viability and said physicians should determine viability. In North Carolina, Republican nominee Ted Budd, like Walker, has expressed opposition to abortion in nearly all cases but also endorsed Graham\u2019s proposal. His opponent, Democrat Cheri Beasley, has said she would support the Roe standard as the rubric for a federal law \u2014 a move that could still allow some state-level restrictions. In Colorado, Republican Joe O\u2019Dea is therare GOP candidate who has spoken out in favor of abortion rights. Trying to pull off an upset against Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet in the liberal-leaning state, O\u2019Dea has called for \u201cbalance\u201d and said abortion should be legal up to 20 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions beyond that in cases of rape, incest and health risks to a woman. That roughly tracks the Supreme Court standard before Roe. He has opposed Graham\u2019s abortion ban proposal, though Bennet has countered by noting that O\u2019Dea has said he would have voted to confirm President Donald Trump\u2019s three Supreme Court nominees, all of whom voted to scrap Roe.",

    "White House keeps focus on abortion as midterms approach": [
        "By CHRIS MEGERIAN and COLLEEN LONGOctober 4, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 With few options for strengthening abortion access, President Joe Biden is trying to keep the issue front and center in the leadup to the midterm elections, when Democrats hope to harness anger over growing restrictions to keep control of Congress. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris gathered several Cabinet secretaries and other top administration officials on Tuesday in a bureaucratic show of force as they met with doctors from around the country. \u201cFolks, what century are we in?\u201d Biden asked, warning that conservatives could unravel the ability to obtain birth control next. \u201cBut this is what it looks like when you start to take away the right of privacy.\u201d The event marked 100 days since the U.S. Supreme Courtoverturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that legalized abortion nationwide. Most abortions are banned in at least 14 states now following a Republican-led effort, and others are weighing severe restrictions. Doctors say the laws, intended or not, have implications far beyond abortion, and have already seen problems with miscarriage care and pregnancy loss. The ripple effects have galvanized Democrats, raising hopes that they might be able todefy political gravitythat usually means the party in power loses seats during the midterms. With a conservative majority on the Supreme Court for the foreseeable future, there\u2019s no path to restoring abortion rights unless Democrats expand their slim majorities in Congress. Voting has already begunin a handful of states, and Harris said more Democrats need to be elected for their party to have the power to pass a nationwide law enshrining abortion access. \u201cIt is important for everyone to know what is at stake,\u201d Harris said. \u201cTo stop and reverse these attacks on women, we need to pass such a national law. And so we need the American people to make their voices heard, and take a stand on the rights of all women to exercise their choice to have access to reproductive healthcare.\u201d Georgia lawprevents abortion after roughly six weeks of pregnancy. Dr. Nisha Verma, who attended the meeting on Tuesday, said she is \u201cbeing forced to grapple with impossible situations where the laws of my state directly violate the medical expertise I gained through years of training, and the oath I took to provide the best care to my patients.\u201d Wisconsin implemented a ban on abortionthat was adopted in 1849, preventing the procedure except to save a mother\u2019s life. The law was written before women were even allowed to vote on it. Dr. Kristin Lyerly said she fears a prosecutor would question a decision to provide an abortion for health reasons. \u201cCan I count on him to trust my clinical judgement? Looking back, would we agree that I met the criteria, that my patient was sick enough?\u201d she said. \u201cThe effects are chilling.\u201d Although the White House has been under pressure to take more aggressive steps to safeguard abortion, there are also concerns about provoking lawsuits that could lead to further restrictions on abortion when the cases reach the Supreme Court. The two steps announced Tuesday are reminders of the administration\u2019s limited toolbox. TheEducation Department is sending guidanceto universities reminding them that federal law requires that they \u201cprotect their students from discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, including pregnancy termination.\u201d The Department of Health and Human Services will also release $6 million in new funding to promote family planning services. In conjunction with the meeting, Jennifer Klein, the director of the White House\u2019s Gender Policy Council and the leader of the White House task force, issued a new memo outlining the impact of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on abortion in the case ofDobbs v. Jackson decision. \u201cClose to 30 million women of reproductive age now live in a state with a ban \u2014 including nearly 22 million women who cannot access abortion care after six weeks, before most women know they are pregnant,\u201d she wrote. \u201cExtreme abortion bans are having consequences that extend beyond abortion, including reports of women being denied access to necessary prescriptions and contraception at pharmacies and on college campuses.\u201d Chris Wilson, a Republican strategist, said he believes the intense reaction to the court decision is fading, undermining Democratic chances in the midterms. \u201cWhat\u2019s sad is the party of \u2018safe, legal and rare\u2019 has become a single-issue party where the new rallying cry is \u2018anytime, any age and paid for by taxpayers\u2019 because they know they\u2019re way behind on the economy, on crime, and don\u2019t even have the advantage on education that they had in years past,\u201d he said. Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, disagreed. She said voter registration has surged among young women, and they\u2019re poised for higher turnout this year. Abortion, she said, is \u201cone of the clearest distinctions between the candidates. So that makes it an issue that\u2019s still very salient.\u201d \u201cRepublicans are battling to make it a referendum,\u201d Lake said. \u201cWe\u2019re battling to make it a choice.\u201d",

    "US starts fiscal year with record $31 trillion in debt": [
        "By FATIMA HUSSEINOctober 4, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The nation\u2019s gross national debt has surpassed $31 trillion, according to a U.S. Treasuryreportreleased Tuesday that logs America\u2019s daily finances. Edging closer to the statutory ceiling of roughly $31.4 trillion \u2014 an artificial cap Congress placed on the U.S. government\u2019s ability to borrow \u2014 the debt numbers hit an already tenuous economy facing high inflation, rising interest rates and a strong U.S. dollar. And while President Joe Biden hastouted his administration\u2019s deficit reductionefforts this year and recently signed the so-called Inflation Reduction Act, which attempts to tame 40-year high price increases caused by a variety of economic factors, economists say the latest debt numbers are a cause for concern. Owen Zidar, a Princeton economist, said rising interest rates will exacerbate the nation\u2019s growing debt issues and make the debt itself more costly. The Federal Reservehas raised ratesseveral times this year in an effort to combat inflation. Zidar said the debt \u201cshould encourage us to consider some tax policies that almost passed through the legislative process but didn\u2019t get enough support,\u201d like imposing higher taxes on the wealthy and closing the carried interest loophole, which allows money managers to treat their income as capital gains. \u201cI think the point here is if you weren\u2019t worried before about the debt before, you should be \u2014 and if you were worried before, you should be even more worried,\u201d Zidar said. The Congressional Budget Office earlier this yearreleased a report on America\u2019s debt load, warning in its 30-year outlook that, if unaddressed, the debt will soon spiral upward to new highs that could ultimately imperil the U.S. economy. In its August Mid-Session Review, the administration forecasted that this year\u2019s budget deficit will be nearly $400 billion lower than it estimated back in March, due in part to stronger than expected revenues, reduced spending, and an economy that has recovered all the jobs lost during the multi-year pandemic. In full, this year\u2019s deficit willdecline by $1.7 trillion, representing the single largest decline in the federal deficit in American history, the Office of Management and Budget said in August. Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said in an emailed statement Tuesday, \u201cThis is a new record no one should be proud of.\u201d \u201cIn the past 18 months, we\u2019ve witnessed inflation rise to a 40-year high, interest rates climbing in part to combat this inflation, and several budget-busting pieces of legislation and executive actions,\u201d MacGuineas said. \u201cWe are addicted to debt.\u201d A representative from the Treasury Department was not immediately available for comment. Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at Loyola Marymount University, said \u201cit took this nation 200 years to pile up its first trillion dollars in national debt, and since the pandemic we have been adding at the rate of 1 trillion nearly every quarter.\u201d Predicting high inflation for the \u201cforeseeable future,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen you increase government spending and money supply, you will pay the price later.\u201d",

    "Both candidates courting veterans in big Nevada Senate race": [
        "By SCOTT SONNEROctober 4, 2022 GMT",
        " RENO, Nev. (AP) \u2014 Common sense more than any campaign strategy dictated that Adam Laxalt not trumpet his own military service in Nevada\u2019s sometimes-heated Republican Senate primary. After all, the ex-attorney general, who served as a Navy judge advocate general in Iraq, was running against retired Army Capt. Sam Brown, a war hero who was nearly killed by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan and whose badly scarred face serves as a more powerful reminder of his sacrifice than his Purple Heart. But with his former foe now turned patriotic ally, Laxalt, the son of a U.S. senator and grandson of another, is trying to make the most of his own military career. He is relying on familiar GOP buzzwords in appealing to veterans to help save the country from \u201cthe left\u201d and calling Democrats the party of the \u201cmegarich\u201d as he tries to unseat Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto. In some cases he is also capitalizing further on his military experience \u2014 and Cortez Masto\u2019s lack of it \u2014 with links to conservative issues from U.S. border safety to government overreach on things like COVID-19. He warns about the dangers of Afghan terrorists, prematurely released from captivity, sneaking into the U.S. and pledges to reinstate military members who were discharged for refusing to get coronavirus vaccinations. They\u2019re the kind of campaign issues that strike a chord with many rallying around candidates like Laxalt, backed by former President Trump in a Western battleground that Republicans view as one of their best chances to turn a blue Senate seat red. \u201cFirst and foremost, there is no substitute for service. And we all know that,\u201d Laxalt said recently at the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Reno, where he and Brown served up free hot dogs. \u201cObviously, Sen. Masto hasn\u2019t served.\u201d It\u2019s a line he couldn\u2019t use in debates with Brown, who denounced Laxalt during the primary as part of the \u201celite\u201d Washington establishment. Laxalt \u2014 the grandson of former U.S. Sen. and Nevada Gov. Paul Laxalt, and son of former Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M. \u2014 spent much of his early life in the D.C. area. He graduated from Georgetown law school, was an assistant law professor at the U.S. Naval Academy and served with the JAG Corps in Iraq but didn\u2019t engage in the sort of field combat Brown saw with the 1st Infantry in 2008. At the VFW, Laxalt was introduced by an ex-commander of a B-2 test squad who created a potentially awkward moment when referencing Laxalt\u2019s role in the military before the room eventually erupted into laughter. \u201cI\u2019ll forgive him for being a JAG,\u201d Air Force Col. Tony Grady said. \u201cBut then, not really, because when I was a commander, the JAG was in my hip pocket, to keep me out of trouble.\u201d Brown never claimed his military record outranked Laxalt\u2019s, but he did make veiled references during the primary to the way each got where they are. \u201cI wasn\u2019t born into power,\u201d Brown said in his first ad, describing the Taliban bomb that \u201cnearly killed me,\u201d the soldiers who dragged his burning body to safety under mortar fire and his subsequent 30 surgeries. Each pitch ended with the same tag line: \u201cCareer politicians can\u2019t fix Washington; they broke it.\u201d Initially, the quote was juxtaposed with images of Cortez Masto and President Joe Biden but later was accompanied by photos of Cortez Masto and Laxalt. Now, Brown is singing Laxalt\u2019s praises and pleading with vets of all political stripes to rally behind him. \u201cWhat we do in primaries as Republicans is identify who can lay down the most effective fire, and they become the main effort,\u201d Brown said. \u201cOur duty is to go out there and be those foot soldiers for Adam Laxalt.\u201d At the VFW, Laxalt linked Cortez Masto to Democratic policies he says have weakened the U.S. military, disrespected its soldiers and made young Americans less likely to enlist. His biggest applause came when he ridiculed those who \u201cwonder why\u201d military recruiting is down. \u201cWell, how about because they kicked out service members for refusing to take the COVID shots?\u201d Laxalt said. \u201cWe have Navy SEALS after 12-year investments and 15 tours of duty to terrible places. I\u2019m a guaranteed vote to reinstate those people.\u201d Laxalt said he\u2019d heard Cortez Masto hadn\u2019t held a town hall meeting with veterans for at least a year. Not true, her campaign said. Cortez Masto, whose father and grandfather served in the U.S. Army, hosted at least a dozen events with Nevada veterans in the past year \u201cto make sure she\u2019s hearing their concerns and is able to deliver the federal support they need,\u201d her campaign said in an email. Her accomplishments include approval of the construction of a national veterans cemetery in Elko that locals had sought for nearly a decade. She helped pass a bill guaranteeing health and compensation benefits for veterans exposed to Agent Orange. Her legislation to protect VA benefits for student veterans was signed into law, as was a measure she backed to improve veterans\u2019 access to mental health services. As he did during the primary, Laxalt reminds vets he founded the nation\u2019s first state office of military legal services as Nevada\u2019s attorney general \u2014 a creation the Pentagon eventually embraced and several states later adopted. He touts his JAG work in Iraq \u2014 where his legal team oversaw more than 20,000 detainees \u2014 when blasting the Biden administration\u2019s withdrawal from Afghanistan, \u201cleaving billions of dollars of weapons behind\u201d for potential terrorists. He said the \u201cAfghan debacle\u201d marked the first time Americans \u201ctook the measure of this commander in chief and knew he was not up to the job.\u201d \u201cSen. Masto is not holding him accountable,\u201d Laxalt said. \u201cA terrorist that was released in Afghanistan could actually be in this country today. This is a huge issue, and it\u2019s an absolute shame that Sen. Masto is dead silent on this.\u201d Cortez Masto insists she has pushed back on Biden\u2019s method of withdrawal from Afghanistan after criticizing Trump\u2019s proposal to withdraw without a plan in place. She gets high marks from Ross Bryant, a retired Army veteran who is the executive director of UNLV\u2019s Military & Veteran Services Center in Las Vegas. Bryant describes himself as a moderate Republican who has voted for candidates in both parties. He\u2019s glad when veterans are elected to Congress and acknowledges the veteran community \u201cis sometimes very harsh: \u2018If you are not a vet, you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like.\u2019\u201d He said that Laxalt \u201cdid great for us\u201d as attorney general, and that Brown\u2019s backing should carry weight with some: \u201cHe\u2019s been wounded, he\u2019s one of us.\u2019\u201d But, he said, it\u2019s wrong to portray Cortez Masto as anything but a staunch, effective advocate for veterans. He ticks off a list that includes expanding Agent Orange coverage to toxic burn-pit exposures, pressuring federal agencies to set up booths at UNLV\u2019s veteran job fairs, and reversing benefit formulas during the COVID pandemic that would have drastically reduced $9 million worth of vet benefits for remote-students at UNLV alone. \u201cAt the end of the day, she has delivered. She\u2019s been a rock star for us,\u201d Bryant said.",

        " ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Former President Donald Trump and his allies have whipped up a relentless campaign of attacks against voting equipment since his loss in the 2020 election. After nearly two years,no evidencehas emerged that voting machines were manipulated to steal the election or that there wasany widespread fraud. Conspiracy theories spread online and inforums across the countrynevertheless have undermined public confidence in voting machines and election results, while leadingsome countiesto consider ditching the equipment in favor of hand-marked andhand-counted ballots. Elections have been held across the country this year during a busy primary season. While programming errors sometimes occur and equipment can malfunction, no major problems have been reported. Voting equipment is tested before and after to identify any problems, while audits done after the election confirm it worked correctly. The Associated Press explains how we got to this point, the efforts to increase security of the vote and the fallout from the false claims surrounding the 2020 presidential election. VOTING TECHNOLOGY IN USE IN THE U.S. The types of voting equipment used throughout the U.S. varies by location. For in-person voting, most people fill out ballots by hand, and those ballots are inserted into an electronic tabulator. In many cases, this happens at the polling location. Elsewhere, the ballots are collected in a secured box, with rules governing the chain of custody, and taken to an election office for electronic tabulation. In some places, a specialized computer is used by voters to mark their ballots electronically. Those ballots are printed, reviewed by the voter for accuracy and then inserted into a tabulator at their polling location.A lawsuit in Georgiais challenging the use of these \u201cballot-marking\u201d machines because they use bar codes to record votes. Mailed ballots also are counted by tabulators at a local election office. A small number of jurisdictions, mostly small towns in New England, don\u2019t use tabulators and count their ballots by hand. HOW HAS THIS CHANGED OVER THE YEARS? After the\u201changing chad\u201d chaosof the 2000 election, Congress provided money for voting system upgrades. Many jurisdictions opted for electronic voting machines to replace their punch-card ballot systems. But those machines did not produce a paper record; instead, all votes were cast and recorded electronically. For years, election security experts raised concerns about these \u201cdirect-recording\u201d machines and the potential for someone to tamper with them. A more secure method, they say, is a system that uses paper ballots and electronic tabulation with post-election reviews and tests to ensure the machines faithfully recorded voters\u2019 choices. Over the last decade, state and local governments began replacing their paperless machines, a process that accelerated after the 2016 election and revelations thatRussia had scanned U.S. voting systemslooking for vulnerabilities. Today, paperless machines areused only in Louisianaand a small number of jurisdictions in Indiana, Mississippi, New Jersey, Tennessee and Texas, according to Verified Voting, a group that tracks voting technology in the U.S. CLAIMS MADE AFTER THE 2020 ELECTION In the weeks after the 2020 election, Trump and his allies made numerousunsupported claimsabout voting machines, including that their software was created in foreign countries and designed to flip votes for desired candidates: \u201cWith the turn of a dial or the change of a chip, you can press a button for Trump and it goes to Biden,\u201d Trump said in a Dec. 2 speech. These claims have largely centered on Dominion Voting Systems, one of a handful of companies that dominate the U.S. voting technology market. In response, Dominion has filed defamation lawsuits againstconservative media companiesand Trump lawyersSidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani, saying \u201clies and misinformation have severely damaged our company and diminished the credibility of U.S. elections.\u201d But rather than dissipate,conspiracies surrounding voting machineshave only grown. Trump allies have been traveling the country to speak at conferences and with community groups, armed with algorithms and charts purporting to show machines have somehow been rigged. Election technology expert Kevin Skoglund said part of the challenge is that voting systems are complex. It\u2019s understandable that some people would be persuaded that something nefarious happened when it did not. \u201cIf you are a person who is not technical, if someone is telling you the machines are cheating you, you might believe it because you don\u2019t understand how the systems work,\u201d Skoglund said. ARE VOTING SYSTEMS SECURE? Any device run by software -- a cell phone, a laptop or voting system -- is vulnerable to hacking. That\u2019s why election experts have been pressing for the replacement of paperless voting machines. Experts say the U.S. has taken steps to improve election security in recent years. That includes designating U.S. voting systems in 2017 as\u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d-- on par with the nation\u2019s banks, dams and nuclear power plants. Congress has sent nearly $900 million in election security funding to states, which has been used to replace outdated voting systems, hire cybersecurity staff and beef up cybersecurity defenses. \u201cThere is no such thing as an invulnerable system,\u201d said Larry Norden, an election security expert at the Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t do better. We should always be looking at how we can do better, but you can\u2019t eliminate risk.\u201d FALSE CLAIMS FUEL DOUBT AND SECURITY CONCERNS The false claims have not only undermined public confidence in elections. They also have led tosecurity breachesat some local election offices in Colorado, Georgia and Michigan. Soon after the 2020 election, Trump allies seized ona programming errorin a Michigan county and, through the courts, gained legal access to its voting system. But a copy of the county\u2019s election management system was made available at an August 2021 event hosted by a Trump ally, MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, according to attendees. Also released at that event was a copy of the system used inMesa County, Colorado.Details have surfaced recently of another suspected breach \u2014 inCoffee County, Georgiain January 2021 as Trump allies sought ways to overturn the result of the presidential election. And Michiganauthorities are investigatingafter voting equipment in a handful of counties was made accessible to unauthorized people. Those developments have prompted concerns thatrogue election workerssympathetic to conspiracies might use their access to election equipment and the knowledge to launch an attack from within. Apoll worker in Michiganwas recently charged with inserting a personal thumb drive into an electronic pollbook during the state\u2019s primary, whileauthorities in Coloradoare investigating a case in which a voter is suspected of tampering with a voting machine earlier this year. Jen Easterly, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency at the Department of Homeland Security, told reporters Monday that threats to the security of elections have never been more complex \u2014 citingmisinformation, the insider threats andharassment of election workers. THE \u201cMOST SECURE\u201d ELECTION After the 2020 presidential election, a coalition of federal cybersecurity and election officials along with state election officials and representatives from voting machine companies issued a statement calling itthe \u201cmost secure in American history.\u201d The group said there was \u201cno evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.\u201d This was due largely to paper records being available for an estimated 93% of all ballots cast and a system of post-election checks to test the accuracy of the electronic tabulators. In Georgia, the presidential vote was counted three times -- once entirely by hand -- and each tally affirmed President Joe Biden\u2019s win in the state. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what happens in the machine,\u201d said Norden, of the Brennan Center. \u201cWe have a piece of paper that tells us whether votes were recorded accurately.\u201d ___ Associated Press technology writer Frank Bajak in Lima, Peru, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP for full coverage of the midterms at https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections and on Twitter at https://twitter.com/ap_politics",

    "Lawyers: Arizona GOP chair pleaded Fifth to Jan. 6 panel": [
        "By BOB CHRISTIEOctober 4, 2022 GMT",
        " PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward refused to answer questions during a deposition of the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol, an attorney for the panel revealed Tuesday during a court hearing in Phoenix. Attorney Eric Columbus told a federal judge that Ward asserted her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when she complied with a subpoena from the House committee. The detail about Ward\u2019s deposition came at a hearing where lawyers urged a federal judge to block the committee from getting her phone records while she appeals.U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa ruled on Sept. 23that Ward\u2019s arguments that her phone call records should be secret did not pass legal muster. Ward attorney Laurin Mills cast the phone records fight as one with major implications for democracy, on par if not bigger than the violent insurrection that unfolded at the Capitol. \u201cThis is the first time in American history that a select committee of the United State Congress controlled by one party has subpoenaed the records of the state chair of the rival party,\u201d Mills said. He said the outcome will set important precedent, not just for the current case but for others that will come when Republicans ultimately control Congress. The House Committee investigating the attack on the Capitol is seeking phone records from just before the November 2020 election to Jan. 31, 2021. That would include a period where Ward was pushing for former President Donald Trump\u2019s election defeat to be overturned and while Congress was set to certify the results. Kelli Ward and her husband Michael Ward were presidential electors who would have voted for Trump in the Electoral College had he won Arizona. Both signed a document falsely claiming they were Arizona\u2019s true electors, despite Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the state. Columbus said that investigators get telephone records all the time, and noted that congressional investigators can\u2019t arrest or charge anyone with a crime. And he noted Congress does not know all that is involved with Ward\u2019s action to overturn President Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 win. \u201cDr. Ward was deposed by the select committee and she declined to answer on every substantive question under her rights under the Fifth Amendment,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are other aspects of her involvement that are not at this point fully understood.\u201d Ward is hardly the first witness to refuse the committee\u2019s questions. Others who have asserted their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination include Trump allies Michael Flynn, Roger Stone and lawyer John Eastman. Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones also asserted his Fifth Amendment rights. The committee has talked to more than 1,000 other witnesses, including many White House aides and several of Trump\u2019s lawyers and confidants. But Mills noted during the hearing that there is a parallel criminal investigation underway, and in the appeal her lawyers noted that she and the other 10 fake Arizona electors received grand jury subpoenas from the Department of Justice. \u201cAll I can say is if we do this wrong, we will set a precedent that is worse than the Capitol riot,\u201d Mills said. Mills told the judge that the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has set a briefing schedule and could decide the case as early as January. Columbus noted that will likely be too late, since the committee dissolves on Jan. 3, when the current congressional session ends. The Wards say the subpoena should be quashed because it violates their First Amendment rights, violates House rules and exceeds the authority of the Jan. 6 committee. Humetewa rejected each argument in turn in her earlier ruling and is considering their request to block access during appeal. Kelli Ward is a staunch Trump ally who has aggressively promoted the false claim that the election was stolen from him. In the days after the election, she pressured Republicans on the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors to investigate unsupported claims of fraud before election results were certified, according to text messages released by the county. A spokesperson for the. 6 committee did not immediately respond Tuesday to a request for comment. ___ Associated Press writers Farnoush Amiri and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed from Washington.",

    "Rival calls incendiary ad by Kentucky Sen. Paul \u2018dangerous\u2019": [
        "By BRUCE SCHREINEROctober 4, 2022 GMT",
        " LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) \u2014 Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul was the victim of a violent attack in 2017 when his neighbor slammed into him from behind outside his Kentucky home. Earlier that year, Paul took cover when a gunman opened fire while GOP members of Congress practiced for a charity baseball game. Paul revived those traumatic events in his bid for reelection this year, with an incendiary social media video attacking his Democratic challenger, Charles Booker. The video, released Monday shortly before a Senate campaign forum he declined to take part in, says outright that Booker \u201cdoesn\u2019t believe in civil discourse, only violence.\u201d It accuses the Black former state lawmaker of associating with members of the \u201cradical left\u201d who condone and perpetrate violence. Booker denounced the ad, saying it includes \u201cdangerous and dishonest rhetoric.\u201d \u201cHis ad grossly lies about me and, in a very sinister way, attacks several Kentucky citizens by name,\u201d Booker said Tuesday. \u201cNeither I, nor my campaign, have ever endorsed violence against any political candidate. It is despicable for Rand Paul to even insinuate that. As an elected official and candidate, my family and I have received death threats \u2014 this is not something I take lightly because I understand the issue intimately.\u201d The video was the latest eyebrow-raising tactic in a campaign featuring unconventional politicians. Booker appeared with anoose around his neckin an online ad soon after the spring primary to draw attention to Paul\u2019s stance on anti-lynching legislation. Paul\u2019s video doesn\u2019t mention unrest from the far right or the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. In the wake of the FBI\u2019s search of former President Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago home,law enforcement officialsacross the country warned about an increase in threats and the potential for violent attacks on federal agents or buildings. The video was released as a preemptive attack against Booker shortly before the Democratic challenger appeared at a campaign forum aired on statewide television. Paul, who is seeking a third term in November, was invited but did not participate in the program. Paul\u2019s campaign scoured through social media to make its video claims that Booker\u2019s campaign has \u201cembraced people who celebrate and glorify\u201d violence against Paul. It says a Booker volunteer tweeted a \u201cgraphic doctored image\u201d of Paul with a broken neck. And it claims a woman featured supporting Booker in a social media video has referred to Paul\u2019s attacker as her hero. The senator suffered broken ribs and laterunderwent lung surgeryfor injuries he says he sustained in the attack. The assailant was given a prison sentence and Paul was awarded more than $580,000 indamages and medical expensesin his lawsuit against the man. Booker said Tuesday that to associate him with Paul\u2019s \u201cviolent altercation with his neighbor from five years ago is desperate, ridiculous, wholly offensive and unacceptable.\u201d \u201cRand Paul has used racially charged dog whistles throughout this campaign to paint a violent picture of me, instead of having the backbone to face me and the people of Kentucky on the merits of our vision for this commonwealth,\u201d Booker said. The video also references 2019 remarks by a Black Lives Matter leader in Louisville that appeared to condone violence against Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. \u201cCivil debate is an admired quality in a Republic but justifying, mocking, or celebrating violence, as documented in this video of Booker and his allies, should be rejected,\u201d Paul said Monday. During his Monday night appearance on Kentucky Educational Television, Booker accused Paul of \u201cblowing the dog whistle\u201d on public safety and policing issues. Paul\u2019s campaign and his allies have tried to connect Booker with the \u201cdefund the police\u201d movement. \u201cRand Paul wants people to look at the color of my skin instead of my record,\u201d Booker said. Paul has frequently visited mostly Black neighborhoods during his Senate tenure, touting criminal justice reforms, anti-violence efforts and education initiatives. When pressed during the KET program on whether he supports eliminating law enforcement budgets, Booker replied: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to get rid of budgets for law enforcement or any government agency.\u201d Supporting \u201cstructural change,\u201d he said, doesn\u2019t equate to backing \u201cany sort of abolishment.\u201d \u201cWhen there\u2019s a crisis, when someone\u2019s in an emergency, we all want to call 911 and have someone in law enforcement come to our aid,\u201d Booker said. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t need is that same agency we call to protect and serve us, kick in our door and shoot us in the dead of night.\u201d In 2020, Booker marched in protests sparked in part by the death of Breonna Taylor, a Black womanshotwhen police officers burst into her Louisville apartment during a narcotics investigation. They found no drugs. Booker ran for the Senate that year but narrowly lost in the Democratic primary.",

    "Oath Keepers founder: Be \u2018ready to fight\u2019 after Trump loss": [
        "By ALANNA DURKIN RICHER and LINDSAY WHITEHURSTOctober 4, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Hours after Joe Biden was declared the winner of the 2020 presidential election, the leader of the Oath Keepers extremist group was discussing how to push President Donald Trump to go further in his fight to cling to power, according to messages shown to jurors Tuesdayin his U.S. Capitol attack trial. Prosecutors usedStewart Rhodes\u2019messages and recordings of him speaking from November 2020 to try to show that he had been working behind the scenes for two months to try to stop the transfer of presidential power before his followers attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Rhodes and four associates are facing charges of seditious conspiracy for what authorities allege was adetailed, drawn-out plot to keep Biden out of the White Housethat included putting armed teams on standby outside of Washington. Tuesday was the first full day of testimony in the high-stakes case that\u2019s expected to last several weeks. The five defendants are the first people arrested in the Jan. 6 attack to stand trial forseditious conspiracy\u2014 a rarely used Civil War-era charge that can be difficult to prove. Rhodes\u2019 attorneys have said their defense will focus on Rhodes\u2019 belief that Trump was going to invoke the Insurrection Act and call up the militia to support his bid to stay in power. The messages were revealed during testimony of an FBI agent investigating the insurrection. In several messages sent around Nov. 7, 2020 \u2014 the day that The Associated Press and other news outlets called the election for Biden \u2014 Rhodes pressed others to refuse to accept the results and \u201cbend the knee\u201d to what he saw as an illegitimate administration. In one message, Rhodes urged his followers to get their \u201cget your gear squared away\u201d and be \u201cready to fight.\u201d In another \u2014 sent to a group called \u201cFOS\u201d or \u201cFriends of Stone\u201d that included Trump ally Roger Stone \u2014 Rhodes urged his fellow Oath Keepers to think of the ways early Americans had resisted the British. \u201cWe are now where the founders were in March, 1775,\u201d he wrote. He implored them to \u201cstep up and push Trump to finally take decisive action.\u201d \u201cThe final defense is us and our rifles,\u201d Rhodes wrote to the group. \u201cTrump has one last chance, right now, to stand. But he will need us and our rifles too.\u201d The evening of Nov. 9, Rhodes held a conference call with more than 100 of his followers to discuss the plan. It was secretly recorded by someone on the call and sent to the FBI. Rhodes urged people on the call to go to Washington and let Trump know that \u201cthe people are behind him,\u201d according to a recording played to jurors. Rhodes expressed hope that left-wing antifa activists would start clashes because that would give Trump the \u201creason and rationale for dropping the Insurrection Act.\u201d \u201cSo we have a chance to get President Trump to fight as Commander in Chief. If you\u2019re going to have a fight, guys, you want to start now while he\u2019s still Commander in Chief,\u201d Rhodes told the group. Rhodes said they would have some of their \u201cbest men bolstered up outside\u201d \u2014 or \u201cquick reaction forces\u201d that he said would be \u201cawaiting the president\u2019s orders.\u201d It needed to be that way because that gives you \u201clegal cover,\u201d Rhodes said on the call. Rhodes\u2019 attorney sought to show that prosecutors are cherry-picking messages from hundreds of chats on his phone. Defense attorney Phillip Linder pressed the FBI agent over whether he ever saw Rhodes encourage anybody to do anything illegal before prosecutors objected to the question. \u201cAll we have is bombastic language,\u201d Linder said. Rhodes\u2019 lawyers have said they will argue that their client can\u2019t be guilty of seditious conspiracy because all of his actions were in anticipation of orders he expected were coming from Trump under the Insurrection Act. Even though Trump never did, Rhodes\u2019 lawyers say he was merely lobbying the president to invoke the law, which gives the president wide discretion to decide when military force is necessary, and what qualifies as military force. On trial with Rhodes, of Granbury, Texas, are Kelly Meggs, leader of the Florida chapter of the Oath Keepers; Kenneth Harrelson, another Florida Oath Keeper; Thomas Caldwell, a retired U.S. Navy intelligence officer from Virginia, and Jessica Watkins, who led an Ohio militia group. Prosecutors showed jurors several items found at Caldwell\u2019s home, including a notebook with writing about things like \u201ccomms\u201d and \u201clookouts.\u201d The FBI agent said that \u201cwas all indicative to us of some sort of an operation.\u201d Caldwell\u2019s attorney, David Fischer, pressed the agent on whether the government has any witnesses who claim Caldwell had a plan to attack the Capitol on Jan. 6. The agent said it did not. ___ For full coverage of the Capitol riot, go tohttps://apnews.com/hub/capitol-siege",

    "Justices mull latest challenge to landmark voting rights law": [
        "By MARK SHERMANOctober 4, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority appeared open Tuesday to making it harder to create majority Black electoral districts, in anAlabama casethat could have far-reaching effects on minority voting power across the United States. The justices heard two hours of argumentsin the latest showdown over the federalVoting Rights Act, with lawsuits seeking to force Alabama to create a second Black majority congressional district. About 27% of Alabamians are Black, but they form a majority in just one of the state\u2019s seven congressional districts. The court\u2019s conservatives, in a 5-4 vote in February, blocked a lower court rulingthat would have required a second Black majority district in time for the November elections. A similar ruling to create an additional Black majority district in Louisiana also was put on hold. Conservative high-court majorities have made it harder for racial minorities to use the Voting Rights Act in ideologically divided rulings in2013and2021. A ruling for Alabama in the new case could weaken a powerful tool that civil rights groups and minority voters have used to challenge racial discrimination in redistricting. Some conservative justices seemed sympathetic to Alabama\u2019s arguments that the court should insist on a \u201crace-neutral\u201d approach to redistricting and should make it harder for people claiming racial discrimination in voting to clear an early legal hurdle. Against pushback from Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson and the other liberal justices, Justice Samuel Alito said it\u2019s too easy for people suing over discrimination in redistricting to win because the first bar in the legal test is too low \u2014 simply showing that another political district could be drawn in which minority residents make up a majority of voters. In practice, Alito said, \u201cwill not the plaintiffs always run the table?\u201d The outcome appears to rest with Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh. Their questions suggested they may be open to a more narrow win for Alabama than the broadest outcome the state is asking for, which might even allow states to dismantle existing districts where racial minorities make up more than half the voters. Even the state\u2019s \u201cleast far-reaching argument,\u201d as Alito put it, would result in many fewer districts drawn to give racial minorities the opportunity to elect their candidates of choice, the court\u2019s three liberal justices said. Jackson, the court\u2019s first Black female justice who was hearing her second day of arguments, disagreed with arguments made by Alabama\u2019s lawyer, Edmund LaCour Jr., that redistricting has to be done without regard to race. Constitutional amendments adopted after the Civil War were intended to give a \u201cconstitutional foundation for a piece of legislation that was designed to make people who had less opportunity and less rights equal to white citizens,\u201d Jackson said. The Voting Rights Act \u201cby its plain text is doing that same thing.\u201d Justice Elena Kagan referred to the Voting Rights Act as not only \u201can important statute\u201d but \u201cone of the great achievements of American democracy\u201d while acknowledging that recent Supreme Court cases have cut back on the law. \u201cNow, in recent years, the statute has fared not well in this court,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re asking us essentially to cut back substantially on our 40 years of precedent and to make this, too, extremely difficult to prevail on, so what\u2019s left?\u201d Kagan said to LaCour. Partisan politics underlies the case. Republicans who dominate elective office in Alabama have been resistant to creating a second district with a Democratic-leaning Black majority that could send another Democrat to Congress. Two appointees of President Donald Trump were on the three-judge panel that unanimously held that Alabama likely violated the landmark 1965 law by diluting Black voting strength. The judges found that Alabama has concentrated Black voters in one district, while spreading them out among the others to make it impossible for them to elect a candidate of their choice. Alabama\u2019s Black population is large enough and geographically compact enough to create a second district, the judges found. Alabama argues that the lower court ruling would force it to sort voters by race and the state insists it is taking a \u201crace neutral\u201d approach to redistricting. That argument could resonate with conservative justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts. He has opposed most consideration of race in voting both as a justice and in his time as a lawyer in Republican presidential administrations. Roberts said little Tuesday to telegraph his vote. Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch also had little or nothing to say in court, but Thomas in particular has voted consistently to limit the reach of anti-discrimination laws. The arguments were the first Supreme Court case involving race for Jackson. A challenge to affirmative action in college admissions is set for arguments on Oct. 31. A decision in Merrill v. Milligan is expected by late June. ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court",

    "Herschel Walker paid for girlfriend\u2019s abortion, report says": [
        "By BILL BARROWOctober 4, 2022 GMT",
        " DUNWOODY, Ga. (AP) \u2014Herschel Walker, who has vehemently opposed abortion rights as the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Georgia, paid for an abortion for his girlfriend in 2009, according to anew report.The candidate called the accusation a \u201cflat-out lie\u201d and said he would sue. The Daily Beast spoke to the former girlfriend, who asked that her name not be used out of concerns for her privacy. In the report published late Monday, the news outlet said it reviewed a receipt showing her $575 payment for the procedure, along with a get-well card from Walker and her bank deposit records showing the image of a $700 personal check from Walker dated five days after the abortion receipt. The woman said Walker encouraged her to end the pregnancy, saying that the time wasn\u2019t right for a baby, The Daily Beast reported. As a candidate, Walker has characterized abortion as \u201ca woman killing her baby\u201d and has played up his opposition to the procedure in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling earlier this year stripping a woman\u2019s constitutional right to access abortion services. In a statement, Walker said he would file a lawsuit against The Daily Beast on Tuesday morning. \u201cThis is a flat-out lie \u2014 and I deny this in the strongest terms possible,\u201d he wrote. As of late Tuesday afternoon, Walker had not taken any legal action, according to a campaign spokesman. Matt Fuller, the politics editor for The Daily Beast, tweeted in response to Walker\u2019s initial denial: \u201cI can tell you we stand behind every word and feel very solid about the story.\u201d Later Monday night, Walker appeared on Sean Hannity\u2019s program on Fox News, where Walker was asked if he recalled sending a $700 check to a girlfriend. \u201cWell, I sent money to a lot of people,\u201d he said. \u201cI give money to people all the time because I\u2019m always helping people. I believe in being generous. God has blessed me. I want to bless others.\u201d Former President Donald Trump, who encouraged Walker to run for Senate, said Walker was being \u201cslandered and maligned.\u201d \u201cHerschel has properly denied the charges against him, and I have no doubt he is correct,\u201d Trump said in a statement. Walker and Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock are engaged in a tight contest that is key to the balance of power in the U.S. Senate. The chamber is now divided 50-50, with Vice President Kamala Harris holding the tie-breaking vote to give Democrats control. Warnock won the seat in a special election runoff on Jan. 5, 2021, prevailing by 2 percentage points over then-Sen. Kelly Loeffler, a Republican. The allegation against Walker is the latest in a series of stories about the football legend\u2019s past that has rocked the first-time candidate\u2019s campaign in one of the most competitive Senate races in the country. Earlier this year, Walkeracknowledged reports that he had three children he had not previously talked about publicly. Walker has often boasted of his work helping service members and veterans struggling with mental health. Yet The Associated Press reported in May that various records showed heoverstated his role in a for-profit programthat is alleged to have preyed upon veterans and service members while defrauding the government. The AP also has reported thata review of public recordsdetailed accusations that Walker repeatedly threatened his ex-wife\u2019s life, exaggerated claims of financial success and alarmed business associates with unpredictable behavior. Walker himself has at times discussed his long struggle with mental illness. Republicans targeted Warnock as perhaps the most vulnerable of the Democratic Senate incumbents. But they were also skeptical about Walker\u2019s viability as a statewide candidate, especially through the spring and summer as Walker\u2019s past was aired publicly. In recent months, Walker found his footing by attacking Warnock for backing President Joe Biden\u2019s agenda in Washington. Biden won Georgia narrowly but has seen his approval ratings in the state fall significantly since 2020. But Walker also has made abortion an issue. During the Republican Senate primary, he openly backed a national ban on abortions with no exceptions for cases involving rape, incest or a woman\u2019s health being at risk \u2014 particularly notable at a time when the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court precedent has been overturned and Democrats in Congress have been discussing codifying abortion rights into federal law. \u201cI\u2019m for life,\u201d Walker has said repeatedly as he campaigns. When asked about whether he\u2019d allow for any exceptions, he has said there are \u201cno excuses\u201d for the procedure. As the Republican nominee, Walker has sometimes sidestepped questions about his earlier support for a national abortion ban, a tacit nod to the fact that most voters, including many Republicans, want at least some legal access to abortion. Walker instead tries to turn the issue against Warnock, who supports abortion rights. Walker often says he doesn\u2019t understand how Warnock, a Baptist pastor, can support the procedure being legal. Campaigning in Dunwoody, an Atlanta suburb, on Monday night, Warnock stressed his support for abortion rights. \u201cI have a profound reverence for life. I have a deep and abiding respect for choice. I believe a patient\u2019s room is too small and cramped a space for a woman, her doctor and the United States government,\u201d he said, emphasizing Walker\u2019s support for a national ban. Warnock was dismissive when told of The Daily Beast story and when asked whether it might affect the outcome in Georgia. \u201cI\u2019ll let the pundits decide,\u201d he said. Walker\u2019s son, Christian Walker, criticized his father in aseries of tweetslate Monday, saying his family \u201casked him not to run for office.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care about someone who has a bad past and takes accountability,\u201d Christian Walker tweeted. \u201cBut how DARE YOU LIE and act as though you\u2019re some \u2018moral, Christian, upright man.\u2019 You\u2019ve lived a life of DESTROYING other peoples lives. How dare you.\u201d For now, Republicans in Washington are standing by Walker, with a spokesman for the Senate GOP\u2019s campaign arm dismissing The Daily Beast story as \u201cnonsense\u201d rooted in desperation by Democrats. \u201cThey and their media allies are doing what they always do \u2014 attack Republicans with innuendo and lies,\u201d said Chris Hartline, a top aide at the National Republican Senatorial Committee.",

    "Another shift for NH GOP Senate candidate on 2020 election": [
        "By HOLLY RAMEROctober 4, 2022 GMT",
        " HUDSON, N.H. (AP) \u2014 Don Bolduc isn\u2019t making a full about-face, but the Republican nominee for Senate in New Hampshire can\u2019t seem to stop shifting his position about whetherthe 2020 presidential election was legitimate. The retired Army general claimed during hisprimary campaignthat the White House race was stolen from former President Donald Trump. Then, after Bolduc won the Sept. 13 vote, he said it wasn\u2019t. By Monday, at a town hall in Hudson, he said he doesn\u2019t know what happened. \u201cI can\u2019t say that it was stolen or not. I don\u2019t have enough information,\u201d Bolduc said in response to a voter\u2019s question. \u201cBut what I can say is that we have irregularity.\u201d Bolduc, running against Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan in November, told a second voter who pressed him on the issue that he believes the election was marred by fraud. Then Bolduc suggested that the only way to hold Democrat Joe Biden responsible for what Bolduc considers impeachable offenses as president is to acknowledgehis win. \u201cWe have to be able to say, whether we agree with it or not, a constitutional process was followed to put him in the White House so we can then hold him accountable,\u201d he said. Trump has called Bolduc a \u201cstrong guy, tough guy,\u201d but did not formally endorse the candidate in the primary. Like many others who relied on Trump\u2019s backing or encouragement to help secure a nomination, Bolduc now must try to appeal to a broader swath of the electorate in the general election. Nearly two years after Trump\u2019s defeat, there has been no evidence of widespread fraud. Numerous reviews in the battleground states where Trump disputed his loss have affirmed the results, courts have rejected dozens of lawsuits filed by Trump and his allies, and even Trump\u2019s ownDepartment of Justiceconcluded the results were accurate. Through it all, Bolduc\u2019s position has wavered. During a debate in August, Bolduc was clear: \u201cI signed a letter with 120 other generals and admirals, saying that Trump won the election, and damn it, I stand by my oath,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not switching horses, baby.\u201d But two days after the GOP primary, he toldFox Newsthat had since done \u201ca lot of research\u201d on the topic. \u201cI have come to the conclusion, and I want to be definitive about this, that the election was not stolen,\u201d Bolduc said. One voter who questioned Bolduc on the topic Monday said he was unsatisfied with the candidate\u2019s response, but the other said he has her vote. \u201cI\u2019m done with these treasonous people in the White House, in our government,\u201d said Mary Margaret Burke of Hampstead. \u201cThey need to go, and we need to make that happen.\u201d ___ Follow AP for full coverage of the midterms at https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections and on Twitter, https://twitter.com/ap_politics",

        "By AAMER MADHANIOctober 4, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The U.S. announced plans on Tuesday to provide an additional $625 million in military aid to Ukraine, a package that includes additional advanced rocket systems credited with helping the country\u2019s military gain momentum in its war with Russia. President Joe Biden provided details on the latest package\u2014which includes four High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, known as HIMARS, 200 mine resistant vehicles, hundreds of thousands of rounds of artillery and mortar ammunition\u2014in a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Vice President Kamala Harris joined the leaders on Tuesday\u2019s call. The U.S. and Ukraine leaders spoke asRussia\u2019s upper house of parliamenton Tuesday formally approved the annexation of swaths of Ukrainian territory following referendums that Ukraine and its Western allies dismissed as fraudulent. \u201cPresident Biden also affirmed the continued readiness of the United States to impose severe costs on any individual, entity, or country that provides support to Russia\u2019s purported annexation,\u201d the White House said in a statement. This round of military aid marks the first time the U.S. has sent additional HIMARS to Ukraine since late July. The systems\u2014which will bring the total number of HIMARS sent to Ukraine to 20\u2014 have become a key tool in Ukraine\u2019s ability to strike bridges that Russia has used to supply its troops, enabling Ukrainian forces to make inroads in Russia-controlled regions. The U.S. in recent weeks also provided funding through a separate program \u2014 the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative \u2014 so another 18 HIMARS can be purchased through longer-term contracts. USAI funds are being used as part of the effort by the U.S. and Western allies to ensure Ukraine\u2019s forces are trained and equipped to defend their country in the years to come. But those contracts will take several years to fulfill. This is the first tranche of U.S. aid delivered in the new fiscal year, which began Oct. 1. Ukraine has pressed its counteroffensive in the Kherson region since the summer, relentlessly pummeling Russian supply lines and making inroads into Russian-held areas west of the Dnieper River. Ukrainian troops have been using the HIMARS to repeatedly hit the main bridge across the Dnieper and a dam that served as a second crossing. It also has struck pontoon bridges that Russia has used to supply its troops. Ukraine\u2019s battlefield successes in Kherson are notable since that is one of the four areas that Russia is in the process of annexing. \u2014 Associated Press writer Lolita C.

        "By AAMER MADHANIOctober 4, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden on Tuesday spoke with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to discuss their next steps afterNorth Korea conducted its longest ever test launchby firing a nuclear-capable ballistic missile over Japan. The White House in a statement said the leaders condemned North Korea\u2019s missile test in the \u201cstrongest terms, recognizing the launch as a danger to the Japanese people, destabilizing to the region, and a clear violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions.\u201d The White House said the leaders agreed to coordinate an immediate and longer-term response together, as well as with South Korea, and with the international community. They also vowed to work to limit North Korea\u2019s \u201cability to support its unlawful ballistic missile and weapons of mass destruction programs.\u201d North Korea has test-fired about 40 missiles over about 20 different launch events this year as its leader, Kim Jong Un, refuses to return to nuclear diplomacy with the United States, but Tuesday\u2019s test was the most provocative yet. Tuesday\u2019s launch is the fifth round of weapons tests by North Korea in the past 10 days. The testing spree is an apparent response to two sets of military drills -- one between Washington and Seoul and the other involving Washington, Seoul and Tokyo -- off the Korean Peninsula\u2019s east coast last week. Earlier, Biden\u2019s national security adviser Jake Sullivan spoke with his counterparts, Japanese Secretary General Akiba Takeo and South Korea National Security Office Director Kim Sung-han, to discuss the North Korean provocation. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to detail potential responses being weighed but underscored that administration officials stood ready to hold talks with North Korea without preconditions. The administration has repeatedly appealed to the North through backchannels but Pyongyang has been unresponsive. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that the DPRK has not responded to our outreach,\u201d she said. Biden and Kishida also discussed the cases of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea, according to the White House. Biden administration officials have become increasingly concerned about North Korea efforts to provoke the U.S. and its Pacific allies. Last month, the Biden administration declassified a U.S. intelligence finding that showed believe that the Russians werelooking to purchase North Korean military equipmentfor its fight in Ukraine. North Korea has also sought to tighten relations with Russia as much of Europe and the West has pulled away, blaming the United States for the Ukraine crisis and decrying the West\u2019s \u201chegemonic policy\u201d as justifying military action by Russia in Ukraine to protect itself. The North Koreans have hinted interest in sending construction workers to help rebuild Russian-occupied territories in the country\u2019s east.",

        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Onion has some serious things to say in defense of parody. The satirical site that manages to persuade people to believe the absurd has filed a Supreme Court brief in support of a man who was arrested and prosecuted for making fun of police on social media. \u201cAs the globe\u2019s premier parodists, The Onion\u2019s writers also have a self-serving interest in preventing political authorities from imprisoning humorists,\u201d lawyers for the Onion wrote in a brief filed Monday. \u201cThis brief is submitted in the interest of at least mitigating their future punishment.\u201d The court filingdoesn\u2019t entirely keep a straight face, calling the federal judiciary \u201ctotal Latin dorks.\u201d The Onion said it employs 350,000 people, is read by 4.3 trillion people and \u201chas grown into the single most powerful and influential organization in human history.\u201d The Supreme Court case involves Anthony Novak, who was arrested after he spoofed the Parma, Ohio, police force in Facebook posts. The posts were published over 12 hours and included an announcement of new police hiring \u201cstrongly encouraging minorities to not apply.\u201d Another post promoted a fake event in which child sex offenders could be \u201cremoved from the sex offender registry and accepted as an honorary police officer.\u201d After being acquitted of criminal charges, the man sued the police for violating his constitutional rights. But a federal appeals court ruled the officers have \u201cqualified immunity\u201d and threw out the lawsuit. One issue is whether people might reasonably have believed that what they saw on Novak\u2019s site was real. But The Onion said Novak had no obligation to post a disclaimer. \u201cPut simply, for parody to work, it has to plausibly mimic the original,\u201d the Onion said, noting its own tendency to mimic \u201cthe dry tone of an Associated Press news story.\u201d More than once, people have republished the Onion\u2019s claims as true, including when it reported in2012 that North Korean leader Kim Jong-unwas the sexiest man alive.

    "Solomon Islands agreed to accord after China references axed": [
        "By NICK PERRYOctober 4, 2022 GMT",
        " WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) \u2014 Solomon Islands agreed to sign an accord between the United States and more than a dozen Pacific nations only after indirect references to China were removed, the Solomon Islands foreign minister said Tuesday. \u201cThere were some references that put us in a position where we\u2019ll have to choose sides, and we did not want to be placed in a position where we have to choose sides,\u201d Jeremiah Manele told reporters in Wellington. His remarks represented the first time Solomon Islands has publicly acknowledged it had initial concerns about the agreement and expressed why it had a change of heart. The accord wassigned in Washingtonlast week, with President Joe Biden telling visiting Pacific leaders that the U.S. was committed to bolstering its presence in the region and becoming a more collaborative partner. The administration pledged the U.S. would add $810 million in new aid for Pacific Island nations over the next decade. The summit came amid growing U.S. concern about China\u2019s military and economic influence in the Pacific. But thefinal agreementfocused mainly on issues like climate change, economic growth and natural disasters. A small section on security contained mostly broad language, and while it specifically condemned Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, it made no mention of China. Ahead of the summit, diplomats had said Solomon Islands was signaling it was unlikely to sign the joint declaration, which would have represented a diplomatic blow for both the U.S. and the Pacific nations. Many in the U.S. and the Pacific had been eager to get Solomon Islands on board afterbecoming alarmedabout the increasing ties between Solomon Islands and China, especially after the two nations signed a security agreement earlier this year. \u201cIn the initial draft, there were some references that we were not comfortable with, but then with the officials, after discussions and negotiations, we were able to find common ground,\u201d Manele said. Pressed further by reporters on those concerns, Manele acknowledged the draft had contained indirect references to China. He said the Solomon Islands security agreement with China was part of a national security strategy and there was no provision in it for China to build a military base, as some had feared. Meanwhile, in a report released Wednesday, researchers at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute think tank said the Chinese Communist Party has attempted to undermine the Solomon Islands\u2019 relationship with Australia and the U.S. by spreading false narratives through local and social media networks in Solomon Islands. The authors said they collected data from after riots that occurred in the capital last November and again after details of the security agreement with China were leaked in March and found the Communist Party used Facebook groups along with certain journalists and decision-makers to push its message. The authors said one false narrative pushed by the party was that Australia, the U.S. and Taiwan had instigated the riots and fomented unrest in the nation. Manele met with his New Zealand counterpart, Nanaia Mahuta, in Wellington at a potentially awkward venue \u2014 Parliament\u2019sRainbow Room, which is dedicated to the nation\u2019s gay, lesbian and transgender communities. The room features photographs of LGBTQ lawmakers and framed copies of bills relevant to those communities. In Solomon Islands, gay and lesbian sex remain illegal. Manele said Solomon Islands was a young democracy. \u201cThese are emerging issues. These are challenges that as a young country we will find ways to discuss,\u201d he said. Mahuta said there was no undertone or message intended in the choice of location. \u201cIt was the only available room for us to use,\u201d she said.",

    "Kelly, Hobbs face different prospects in crucial Ariz. races": [
        "By JONATHAN J. COOPEROctober 4, 2022 GMT",
        " PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 A year ago, Arizona\u2019s Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs was all over cable news, building a national profile as a defender of democracy and raking in cash for her campaign for governor. Democratic Sen.Mark Kelly, newly elected to finish the late John McCain\u2019s last term and running for reelection, looked to be among the most vulnerable members of the Senate. Fortunes appear to have flipped for the two Democrats as the midterm campaign enters the home stretch in a fast-growing, diverse state that is increasingly central to how the Democratic Party sees its future. Kelly maintains a position of strength in polling and fundraising while Hobbs is in a tighter spot. The dynamics reflect how the campaigns have sometimes pursued different strategies and face different types of rivals.Kari Lake, Hobbs\u2019 opponent as the Republican nominee for governor, has gained a significant following as a savvy ally of former President Donald Trump. Blake Masters, Kelly\u2019s rival in the Senate race, has struggled to gain the same type of traction. \u201cPeople like shiny objects, and Kari Lake is that shiny object that\u2019s putting herself out there,\u201d said Bridget Bellavigna, a Democrat who was inspired by Trump\u2019s election to get involved in local politics. She\u2019s running for constable in the Phoenix suburbs. A Fox News poll released Thursday found Kelly leading Republican Blake Masters 46% to 40%, while the race for governor was roughly tied. The survey of 1,008 Arizona voters was conducted Sept. 22-26. The margin of error was 3 percentage points. Hobbs and Kelly are working largely independently of one another and have not campaigned together. Both portray their Republican opponents as extremists but otherwise are taking different approaches to their public persona. Kelly, a former Navy pilot and astronaut, flies around the state in a rented four-seat plane, courting media attention along the way. Hobbs, by contrast, had a sparse presence on the campaign trail through the Democratic primary in August and much of the period since. She\u2019s focused her attention on rural areas far from the voter-rich areas of Phoenix and Tucson, where Democrats have to drive up turnout if they\u2019re to be competitive here. She\u2019s been more visible over the past two weeks, though she prefers choreographed events in which she largely sticks to a script and limits her interactions with journalists. In a brief interaction after an event last month, Hobbs said she\u2019s not running from tough questions. \u201cI\u2019m doing what my team is having me do,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to dodge anything.\u201d Hobbs is playing \u201cprevent defense,\u201d a cautious football strategy that concedes short gains to the opponent in an attempt to run out the clock, said Wes Gullett, a Republican consultant and former adviser to McCain. Gullett attached his name to a public list of Republicans supporting Democrat Adrian Fontes for secretary of state, but he\u2019s declined to do the same for Hobbs, though he says he\u2019d prefer that she beats Lake. \u201cWhat I want to see from Katie Hobbs is a more aggressive candidate,\u201d Gullett said. \u201cTalking about the issues that she cares about, talking about what\u2019s important.\u201d Late last month, Hobbs jumped on a chance to sharpen her message when a judge in Tucson ruled thatprosecutors can enforcea near-total ban on abortion that was first enacted during the Civil War. She pledged to use the full power of the governor\u2019s office toprotect women\u2019s rights, though she acknowledged there was little she could do without cooperation from the Legislature, which is likely to be controlled at least in part byRepublicans who oppose abortion. Hobbs announced over the weekend that she raised $1.2 million in the week following the abortion ruling, a major uptick in fundraising, though she hasn\u2019t yet had to file campaign finance statements that would confirm the numbers. Hobbs is a former social worker who worked with people experiencing homelessness and later was a lobbyist for a domestic violence shelter. She was elected to the Legislature in 2010, running on a slate with now-U.S. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema to represent the same central Phoenix district, Hobbs in the House and Sinema in the Senate. \u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re confident that sanity will beat chaos and Sec. Hobbs will be elected in November,\u201d Hobbs campaign manager Nicole DeMont said in a statement to The Associated Press. The race for governor is closer than the race for Senate because Hobbs faces a tougher matchup, said Chad Campbell, a Democratic consultant and former Arizona legislator. Lake is a stronger candidate than Masters, he said. \u201cKari Lake is a better version of Trump,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cShe\u2019s a more polished, better looking version of Donald Trump.\u201d It also helps Kelly that Senate races attract significantly more money than campaigns for governor, allowing Kelly and Democratic allies to relentlessly attack Masters, who is struggling to keep up financially. The Senate race also has a Libertarian candidate who could draw votes from right-leaning voters. Independent voters make up a third of the electorate in Arizona and hold the keys to statewide victories. They often split their tickets, electing Sinema to the Senate and Republican Doug Ducey as governor in 2018. Two years later, they propelled Kelly to a 2.4 percentage point victory while Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden eked out a 0.3 point win, the closest margin of any state he won. Republicans ran the table on the rest of the ballot. Hobbs became the undisputed Democratic frontrunner last year when she forcefully defended the 2020 election as Trump supporters oversaw a discredited recount of ballots in Maricopa County on behalf of state Senate Republicans. But she\u2019s struggled to translate her defense of democracy into a firm position of strength. Her own missteps haven\u2019t helped. Late last year, a jury for a second time sided with a Black former legislative aide, Talonya Adams, who said she wasfired for discriminatory reasonsin 2015, when Hobbs was the top Democrat in the Senate. Hobbs testified that she made a group decision with two others to fire Adams. Hobbs at first defended the decision and deflected responsibility, blaming Republicans for underpaying Adams. After a firestorm from Democrats who felt she was dismissive of workplace discrimination against people of color, Hobbsapologized to Adamsand said her initial response \u201cfell short of taking real accountability.\u201d Two-thirds of the Hobbs campaign staff quit this summer, telling the Arizona Agenda newsletter that the atmosphere was emotionally abusive. More recently, she\u2019s faced an onslaught of criticism, even from allies, and weeks of negative headlines forher decision not to debate Lake. \u201cIt\u2019s bad for her not to,\u201d said Linda Martini, a Democratic volunteer from Phoenix who tried to share her opinion with Hobbs at a recent campaign event but was rebuffed by the candidate, who walked away. \u201cFurthermore, she could destroy her opponents. There\u2019s no doubt about it. And the people want to see her on TV.\u201d",

        "October 4, 2022 GMT",
        " NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Former PresidentDonald Trumpon Monday sued CNN, seeking $475 million in damages, saying the network had defamed him in an effort to short-circuit any future political campaign. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, focuses primarily on the term \u201cThe Big Lie\u201d about Trump\u2019s false claims of widespread fraud that he says cost him the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden. CNN said it had no comment on the lawsuit. Trump repeatedly attacked CNN as president, which resonated with his conservative followers. He has similarly filed lawsuits against big tech companies with little success. His case against Twitter for knocking him off its platform following the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S.Capitol insurrectionwas thrown out by a California judge earlier this year. Numerous federal and local election officials in both parties, a long list of courts, top former campaign staffers and even Trump\u2019s own attorney general have all said there is no evidence of the election fraud he alleges. Trump\u2019s lawsuit claims \u201cThe Big Lie,\u201d a phrase with Nazi connotations, has been used in reference to him more than 7,700 times on CNN since January 2021. \u201cIt is intended to aggravate, scare and trigger people,\u201d he said. In a statement Monday, Trump suggested that similar lawsuits would be filed against other news organizations. And he said he may also bring \u201cappropriate action\u201d against the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol by his supporters. The lawsuit comes as he is weighing a potential bid for the presidency in 2024. New CNN chief Chris Licht privately urged his news personnel in a meeting more than three months ago to refrain from using the phrase because it is too close to Democratic efforts to brand the former president, according to several published reports.",

    "Nevada county\u2019s plans to hand-count early ballots challenged": [
        "By GABE STERNOctober 4, 2022 GMT",
        " RENO, Nev. (AP) \u2014 A rural county in Nevada where conspiracy theories about voting machines run deep is planning to start hand-counting its mail-in ballots two weeks beforeElection Day,a process that risks public release of early voting results. Several voting and civil rights groups said Monday they objected to the proposal and will consider legal action if Nye County pushes ahead with its plan. Nevada is one of 10 states that allow local election offices to begin tabulating ballots before Election Day, but the machines that typically do that are programmed not to release results. Nye County officials are planning a full hand-count in addition to a primary machine tabulation for the November election. The move was prompted by unfounded claims of fraud involving voting machines in the 2020 presidential election. Nye County Clerk Mark Kampf said hand-count teams will start tallying mail-in ballots on Oct. 26, just under two weeks ahead of Election Day. Hand-count tallies are done publicly for transparency, with observers in the room. That raises the possibility that someone keeping score could make early results from the count public before most voters have even cast their ballot, voting experts said. \u201cWhen you are releasing results early, there is the potential for manipulative release, intended to try to impact turnout,\u201d said Gowri Ramachandran, a senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, which wrote a letter objecting to Nye County\u2019s plan. Results that change over time also sow distrust of the process. \u201cYou can cause people to be confused about whether results are accurate,\u201d she said. The Brennan Center and ACLU of Nevada say making any results public before voting ends on Election Day violates state law. Athar Haseebullah, executive director of the ACLU\u2019s Nevada chapter, said Monday that a lawsuit against the county \u201cmight be coming sooner rather than later.\u201d The Nye County commission has been pushing ahead with its plan to adopt a hand count of all ballots along with the primary machine tally for the Nov. 3 general election, a decision fueled byunfounded conspiracy theoriesabout its Dominion voting system. Kampf said he did not share the same concerns as the voting groups about the early release of partial results. \u201cThey\u2019re only going to get a small piece of the result, and so no one sees the total result in any place,\u201d he said in a brief interview Monday. Nye County Commissioner Debra Strickland said Kampf has the commission\u2019s support because he \u201chas decided to do as we\u2019ve requested.\u201d Nye County originally was going to start hand-counting both mail ballots and early in-person ballots on Oct. 25, but scrapped that plan after realizing it violated a Nevada statute that says counting early in-person ballots cannot begin until Election Day. Mark Wlaschin, Nevada\u2019s deputy secretary of state for elections, said he has been in touch with Kampf about the county\u2019s plans. Asked about concerns that the early hand-count of mail ballots could lead to results being released before Election Day, Wlaschin said it was a \u201cgood consideration\u201d and he would bring it up with Kampf. Under Nye County\u2019s plan, hand-count teams of five will include a reader who announces each result, a verifier who looks over the reader\u2019s shoulder and three talliers who write down the results. The talliers then compare their results before submitting them. They count in batches of 50 ballots and public observers are allowed in. Hand-counting is mostly used in small townships across New England and rural Wisconsin. There are 658 jurisdictions in the continental U.S. that rely exclusively on hand-counting, with the vast majority having fewer than 2,000 registered voters, according to data from Verified Voting, a group that tracks voting equipment across states. The most populous county in the continental U.S. to use only hand-counting is Owyhee County, Idaho, which had 6,315 registered voters as of 2020. Nye County has over 33,000 registered voters, raising questions about whether a full hand count can be completed before the state deadline to certify the election results. Nevada\u2019s least populous county, Esmeralda, used hand-counting to certify June\u2019s primary results, when officials spent more than seven hours counting just 317 ballots. Kampf was appointed county clerk after the long-time clerk resigned in July, a decision she made afterelection conspiracies spread throughout the county and the board of commissioners voted unanimouslyto recommend doing away with voting machines and count all ballots by hand. He has worked alongside Republican secretary of state candidate Jim Marchant, who helped organize the America First Secretary of State Coalition, a group of candidates running to be their state\u2019s top election official who have repeated Trump\u2019sfalse claimsabout widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Marchant aims to scrap early voting and voting machines. ___ Associated Press writer Christina A.

    "Biden tells Puerto Ricans he\u2019s \u2018committed to this island\u2019": [
        "By SEUNG MIN KIM, DARLENE SUPERVILLE and DANICA COTOOctober 3, 2022 GMT",
        " PONCE, Puerto Rico (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden promised to \u201crebuild it all\u201d while visiting Puerto Rico on Monday, as tens of thousands of peopleremain without powertwo weeks after Hurricane Fiona struck and residents worry that Washington\u2019s dedication to their recovery could prove fleeting. \u201cI\u2019m committed to this island,\u201d he said after receiving a briefing from local officials, acknowledging that Fiona was only the latest in a string of disasters that have pummeled the U.S. territory in recent years. \u201cPuerto Ricans are a strong people,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut even so, you have had to bear so much, and more than need be, and you haven\u2019t gotten the help in a timely way.\u201d The damage from Fiona, which came only five years after the even more powerful Hurricane Maria, will test his administration\u2019s ability to help the island of 3.2 million people recover and bolster its defenses. Puerto Rico has a higher poverty rate than any state, and it remains vulnerable to storms that are only becoming more powerful and frequent as climate change continues. \u201cWhat happened with this hurricane is that even though it was Category 1, in terms of water it was like Category 4,\u201d Puerto Rico\u2019s governor, Pedro Pierluisi, told Biden. Fiona made landfall on Sept. 18, knocking out power to the entire island. Although electricity has been restored to 90% of its 1.47 million customers, more than 137,000 others, mostly in the hardest hit areas of Puerto Rico\u2019s southern and western regions,continue to strugglein the dark. Another 66,000 customers are without water. The weather remained ominous during Biden\u2019s visit on Monday. Thunder rumbled and lightning flashed in the distance. \u201cI don\u2019t want the headline to read, \u2018Biden brings storm to Puerto Rico,\u2019\u201d he joked. \u201cSo I\u2019m gonna maybe have to cut this a little short.\u201d Biden announced the administration will provide $60 million through last year\u2019sbipartisan infrastructure lawto help Puerto Rico shore up levees, strengthen flood walls and create a new flood warning system so the island will be better prepared for future storms. Puerto Rico isn\u2019t the only corner of the country that\u2019s reeling from disaster. Florida is cleaning up after Hurricane Ian churned across that state last week, killing more than 60 people, decimating some coastal communities and flooding others. Biden plans to visit Florida on Wednesday to survey damage. \u201cAt times like these, our nation comes together, puts aside our political differences and gets to work,\u201d Biden said. The president was accompanied by first lady Jill Biden, who joined volunteers in a sweltering school gymnasium. She helped stuff plastic bags with canned goods, fruit cups, snack packages and rice. Pallets of bottled water were stacked along the wall. Little storm damage was visible during Biden\u2019s few hours on the ground in Puerto Rico after he touched down in Ponce, a city on the southern coast. Fiona caused catastrophic flooding, tore apart roads and bridges, and unleashed more than 100 landslides when it hit Puerto Rico on Sept. 18. At least two people died after being swept away by floods, and several others were killed in accidents related to the use of candles or generator during the island-wide power outage. Government officials have estimated some $3 billion in damages, but warn that costs could rise significantly as evaluations continue. Some people in Puerto Rico wondered whether Biden\u2019s visit would change anything as they recalled how President Donald Trump visited after Hurricane Maria hit as a more powerful Category 4 storm in 2017, and tossed rolls of paper towels into a crowd in a display that riled many. \u201cWe know that there may have been some issues in the previous administration,\u201d said Deanne Criswell, the Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator who joined Biden on his trip. \u201cWe are laser-focused on giving them the support they need.\u201d Criswell, who said FEMA personnel were sent to the island before the storm and will remain there to help with recovery, visited Puerto Rico shortly after Fiona struck. \u201cThey finally feel like this administration cares for them, and that they\u2019re going to be there for them to support them through this response and recovery effort,\u201d she said. There\u2019s entrenched skepticism in some areas of the island that anything will change. Manuel Veguilla, a 63-year-old retired mechanic who lives in a remote community in the hard-hit northern mountain town of Caguas, said he didn\u2019t expect his life to improve in the aftermath of Fiona, which cut off his neighborhood from any help for a week. \u201cThey always offer the lollipop to the kids,\u201d he said, referring to Biden\u2019s visit. \u201cBut in the end, the outcome is always the same. The aid goes to those who have the most.\u201d Biden recently told Pierluisi that he authorized 100% federal funding for 30 days for debris removal, search and rescue efforts, power and water restoration, shelter and food. Pierluisi asked for the funding to last for 180 days. In his remarks, Biden said, \u201cI\u2019m confident we\u2019re going to be able to do all you want, governor.\u201d The lack of electrical power on the island led to the temporary closure of businesses, including gas stations and grocery stores, as fuel supplies dwindled amid heavy generator use. As a result, many cheered the Biden administration\u2019s decision to temporarily waive a federal law so that a British Petroleum ship could deliver 300,000 barrels of diesel. Many also have begun demanding that Puerto Rico be fully exempted from the law, known asthe Jones Act, that requires that all goods transported to Puerto Rico be aboard a ship built in the U.S., owned and crewed by U.S. citizens and flying the U.S. flag. This drives up costs for an island that already imports 85% of its food. ___ Superville reported from Washington. Coto reported from San Juan, Puerto Rico.

    "Oath Keepers trial: Jan. 6 was \u2018rebellion,\u2019 prosecutor says": [
        "By ALANNA DURKIN RICHER, MICHAEL KUNZELMAN and LINDSAY WHITEHURSTOctober 3, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The founder of the Oath Keepers extremist group and four associates planned an \u201carmed rebellion\u201d to keepPresident Donald Trumpin power, a federal prosecutor contended Monday as themost serious case yetwent to trial in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Stewart Rhodes and his band of extremists were prepared to go to war to stop Joe Biden from becoming president, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Nestler told jurors. The group celebrated the Capitol attack as a victory in that fight and continued their plot even after Biden\u2019s electoral victory was certified, Nestler alleged. \u201cTheir goal was to stop, by whatever means necessary, the lawful transfer of presidential power, including by taking up arms against the United States government,\u201d the prosecutor said during his opening statement. \u201cThey concocted a plan for armed rebellion to shatter a bedrock of American democracy.\u201d The defendants are the first among hundreds of people arrested in the Capitol riot to stand trial onseditious conspiracy, a rare Civil War-era charge that calls for up to 20 years behind bars. The stakes are high for the Justice Department, which last secured such a conviction at trial nearly 30 years ago, and intends to try two more groups on the charge later this year. The trial comes as Trump continues to insist, against much evidence, that the 2020 election was stolen from him, and as vocal pushback against the charges filed against those who entered the Capitol continues in some quarters. The broader reaction could show how the American public, as well as the jury, sees the attack, nearly two years later. Defense attorneys accused prosecutors of cherry-picking comments from messages and videos and said the government has no evidence there ever was any plan to attack the Capitol. Rhodes\u2019 attorneysaid his client will take the standand show that the Oath Keepers had merely been preparing for orders they expected from Trump but never came. \u201cStewart Rhodes meant no harm to the Capitol that day. Stewart Rhodes did not have any violent intent that day,\u201d Rhodes\u2019 attorney, Phillip Linder, said. \u201cThe story the government is trying to tell you today is completely wrong.\u201d On trial with Rhodes, of Granbury, Texas, are Kelly Meggs, leader of the Florida chapter of the Oath Keepers; Kenneth Harrelson, another Florida Oath Keeper; Thomas Caldwell, a retired U.S. Navy intelligence officer from Virginia, and Jessica Watkins, who led an Ohio militia group. They face several other charges as well. They are among roughly 900 people who have been charged in the attack, which temporarily halted the certification of Biden\u2019s victory, sent lawmakers running for cover and left dozens of police officers injured. In the Oath Keepers case, prosecutors will try to prove that their actionswere not a spontaneous outpouring of election-fueled rage but part of a detailed, drawn-out plot to stop Biden from entering the White House. The Oath Keepers \u201cwere prepared in November, they were prepared in December and when the opportunity finally presented itself on Jan 6, 2021, they sprang into action,\u201d Nestler said. Rhodes began plotting to overturn Biden\u2019s victory right after the election, Nestler said. In November 2020, Rhodes sent his followers a step-by-step plan for stopping the transfer of power based on a popular uprising that brought down Yugoslavia\u2019s president two decades earlier. Around the same time, Rhodes was also communicating in another internet group \u2014 which included Trump ally Roger Stone \u2014 that was called \u201cFOS,\u201d or \u201cFriends of Stone,\u201d according to testimony. On Nov. 7, 2020, Rhodes said in a message to that group that he was on his way to D.C. for a possible \u201cop\u201d and was available to meet \u201cface-to-face.\u201d As December approached, Rhodes\u2019 rhetoric became increasingly violent and desperate, Nestler said. In messages and comments read to the jury, the Oath Keepers repeatedly warned of violence if Biden were to become president. During a December interview, Rhodes called senators \u201ctraitors\u201d and warned that the Oath Keepers would have to \u201coverthrow, abort or abolish Congress.\u201d He described Jan. 6 as a \u201chard constitutional deadline\u201d for stopping the transfer of power. The Oath Keepers organized training, including one session on \u201cunconventional warfare.\u201d Before coming to Washington, they stashed \u201cweapons of war\u201d at a Virginia hotel to serve as \u201cquick reaction force\u201d that could get guns into the capital quickly if necessary, the prosecutor said. As Oath Keepers stormed the Capitol in helmets and other battle gear, Rhodes remained on the outside, like \u201ca general surveying his troops on a battlefield,\u201d Nestler said. After the attack, the elated Oath Keepers went to a Virginia restaurant to celebrate their victory, the prosecutor said. In the days between the riot and Biden\u2019s inauguration, Rhodes spent more than $17,000 on firearm parts, ammunition and other items, prosecutors say. Shortly after the insurrection, Rhodes was secretly recorded saying that his \u201conly regret is that they should have brought rifles,\u201d Nestler said. Among those who may testify during the trial, which will last several weeks, are three Oath Keepers who\u2019ve pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy and are cooperating with prosecutors in hopes of getting lighter sentences. They include a man who says that after arriving in Washington, Meggs told him that another Florida Oath Keeper had brought explosives in his RV. The government\u2019s first witness was a FBI agent, who responded on Jan. 6 to help rescue senators. He described lawmakers crying, broken doors and windows and a scene that \u201clooked like a bomb had gone off.\u201d Defense lawyers say prosecutors have ripped the Oath Keepers\u2019 messages out of context to paint them unfairly. The Oath Keepers came to Washington to provide security at events for figures such as Stone before the president\u2019s big outdoor rally behind the White House, defense lawyers said. Rhodes\u2019 attorney described the group as a \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d force and called his client an \u201cextremely patriotic\u201d man who \u201cloves this country.\u201d Rhodes\u2019 attorneys plan to argue that Rhodes believed Trump was going to going to invoke the Insurrection Act and call up a militia, which Rhodes had been calling on him to do to stop Biden from becoming president. Rhodes\u2019 lawyers have said he was merely lobbying the president to invoke a U.S. law. Prosecutors say it\u2019s clear the Oath Keepers were going to act regardless of what Trump did. Nestler told jurors that Rhodes, a Yale Law School graduate, was only using the Insurrection Act as \u201clegal cover.\u201d In one message, Rhodes wrote in December 2020 that Trump \u201cneeds to know that if he fails to act, then we will.\u201d An attorney for Caldwell said his client is a disabled veteran who didn\u2019t even know of the Oath Keepers until November 2020. The defense lawyer, David Fischer, called Jan. 6 a \u201cblack eye\u201d for the country, but said Caldwell merely came to Washington \u201con a date with his wife\u201d and wasn\u2019t een planning to go to the Capitol until Trump\u2019s speech on the Ellipse before the riot. \u201cMr. Caldwell couldn\u2019t storm his way out of a paper bag,\u201d Fischer said. \u201cI came here to clear his name.\u201d ___ This story has been corrected to reflect that there are five defendants, not five men, on trial. ___ For full coverage of the Capitol riot, go to https://www.apnews.com/capitol-siege More on Donald Trump-related investigations: https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump",

    "Trump rallies drift to fringe ahead of potential 2024 bid": [
        "By JILL COLVINOctober 3, 2022 GMT",
        " WARREN, Mich. (AP) \u2014 Paige Cole is one of the \u201cAnons.\u201d The mother of three from Eastpointe, Michigan, saysJoe Bidenis a sham president and believesDonald Trumpwill soon be reinstated to the White House to finish the remainder of Biden\u2019s term. \u201cHis whole inauguration was fake. He didn\u2019t have real military people. He had, like, fake badges, fake people. And Trump is actually our president,\u201d she said while waiting in line for his latest rally on Saturday at Macomb Community College. Wearing a pink \u201cTrump 2024\u201d hat and draped in a large \u201cTRUMP WON\u201d flag, Cole \u2014 a former Democrat who says she voted twice for Barack Obama \u2014 began to cry as she described the significance of Trump\u2019s return and the 1,000 years of peace she believes will be ushered in with it. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna change everything,\u201d she says, \u201clike we have never in humanity seen before.\u201d Trump\u2019s rallies have always attracted a broad swath of supporters, from first timers taking advantage of their chance to see a president in person, todevotees who camp out for daysand follow him around the country like rock band groupies. But after spending much of the last two years obsessively peddling false claims of a stolen election, Trump is increasingly attracting those who have broken with reality, including adherents of the baseless QAnon conspiracy, which began in the dark corners of the internet and is premised on the belief that the country is run by a ring of child sex traffickers, satanic pedophiles and cannibals that only Trump can defeat. As he eyes another White House bid, Trump is increasinglyflirting with the conspiracy. He\u2019s reposted Q memes on his social media platform and amplified users who have promoted the movement\u2019s slogans, videos and imagery. And in recent weeks, he has been closing out his rally speeches with an instrumental song that QAnon adherents have claimed as their anthem and renamed \u201cWWG1WGA\u201d after the group\u2019s \u201cWhere we go one, we go all\u201d slogan. Trump and his allies often dismiss suggestions that he advances conspiracy theories or condones violence. \u201cThe continued attempts by the media to invent and amplify conspiracies, while also fanning the flames of division, is truly sick,\u201d his spokesperson, Taylor Budowich, said in a statement. \u201cAmerica is a nation in decline and our people are suffering, President Trump and his America First movement will not be distracted by the media\u2019s nonsense, and he will instead continue fighting to Make America Great Again.\u201d But interviews with more than a dozen Michigan rallygoers Saturday underscore his influence and serve as a reminder that many cling to his every word and see his actions as validation. Several of those interviewed said they only began attending Trump\u2019s rallies after the 2020 election, when they said they had become more politically engaged. Several, like Virginia Greenlee, of Holland, Michigan, said they had been in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021, when Trump supporters violently stormed the U.S. Capitol, trying to halt the peaceful transition of power by disrupting the certification of Biden\u2019s win. \u201cPresident Trump really woke people up because I didn\u2019t even know there was a deep state or fake media, fake news, until he started bringing light,\u201d said Greenlee, who said she did not go inside the building but watched from outside. She blamed the violence on leftist protesters masquerading as Trump supporters, though there is no evidence to support that claim. Meanwhile, Trump continues to elevate those who peddle conspiracies. Mike Lindell, the MyPillow salesman who has spent millions trying (and failing) to prove the election was stolen, spoke twice Saturday \u2014 once outside to attendees waiting in line to enter and again during the rally program. Also in attendance was Marjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right Georgia congresswoman who told the crowd that \u201cDemocrats want Republicans dead. And they\u2019ve already started the killings.\u201d Trump has long used angry and violent rhetoric to rile up his supporters, even after Jan. 6 made clear that some may act on that anger. As he inches closer to a possible announcement, Trump has leaned into the kind of racist and violent language that helped him clinch victory in 2016, when his ever-more-shocking statements \u2014 and the inevitable backlash \u2014 helped him dominate the news. On Friday, he again attacked Mitch McConnell, this time in a racist post on his social media site that accused the Senate Republican leader of having a \u201cdeath wish\u201d and derided McConnell\u2019s wife, who was born in Taiwan and served in Trump\u2019s administration as a Cabinet secretary. On Saturday, the crowd cheered enthusiastically as Trump touted plans to use the death penalty to kill drug dealers and traffickers if he returns to the White House, emulating the strongman leaders he\u2019s often admired. And again, he empathized with the Jan. 6 defendants who have been jailed for their role in the insurrection, casting the rioters \u2014 whom he has alreadypledged to pardonif he runs and wins \u2014 as \u201cpolitical prisoners\u201d and accusing authorities of \u201cpersecuting people who just happened to be there, many of them didn\u2019t even go in.\u201d The crowd in turn, broke into numerous \u201cLock her up!\u201d chants directed at Trump\u2019s 2016 Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, as well as the state\u2019s Democratic governor, secretary of state and attorney general, whom his endorsed candidates are trying to unseat. Still, Trump aides seem to want to have it both ways. As he began to wrap up his speech, some in the crowd raised their index fingers in what has been described as a QAnon salute. But for the second week in a row, burly event staff with tattoos carefully scanned the crowd, quickly asking those who raised their fingers to put them down. \u201cThey said they didn\u2019t want hands in the air,\u201d one of them explained he\u2019d been told. Still, Trump\u2019s nods to QAnon are encouraging to people like Cole, who said Trump had opened her eyes \u201cto everything, to the evil in the world.\u201d A 55-year-old semi-retired certified nursing assistant who relies on a bevy of fringe podcasts for information since eschewing cable news, Cole believes \u201cour money\u2019s no good because it was controlled by the Rothschilds,\u201d an anti-Semitic trope, and that the Supreme Court has \u201calready overturned\u201d the 2020 election, but \u201cthey\u2019re just sitting on it and they\u2019re waiting for things to come about.\u201d \u201cWe have to listen to underground news to get the truth of what\u2019s going on, really,\u201d she said. Trump\u2019s decision to play the song, she said after the rally, shows the American people \u201cand all those affiliated and committed in with the WWG1WGA bond and mission, that President Trump, too, is doing his best to help all involved to eradicate worldwide evil and helping to make the world better for all. It brings me strength in my mind to hold onto the hope and promises for a better life for all.\u201d But some in the crowd voiced discomfort. Christina Whipkey, 50, who lives in Warren, Michigan, said she found Trump\u2019s flirtations with QAnon \u201ckind of weird\u201d and \u201codd\u201d and worried their presence at his rallies was playing into negative stereotypes. \u201cI didn\u2019t like that,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s telling people what they said about us all along, that we\u2019re all just a bunch of QAnon supporters.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t want people to think just because you support him that you\u2019re that far into it, that you\u2019re one of those people,\u201d she went on. \u201cYou don\u2019t want people to think that about you.\u201d A longtime Trump supporter who remembers talking about him running for president while playing his board game in high school, Whipkey also said she thinks it\u2019s time for Trump to move on from the 2020 election, even if she has concerns about the vote. \u201cI just wish he\u2019d let that go now. Focus more on the future than on the past,\u201d she said, worried he was turning off potential voters. \u201cThey\u2019re tired of hearing it ... You get to a point where it\u2019s like, \u2018All right, buddy. We heard it enough. We got it. We know.\u2019\u201d Laurie Letzgus, 51, a machine operator from Port Huron, Michigan, and another longtime supporter, agreed. \u201cIt is time to move on, I think,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s look forward. And let\u2019s look to 2024.\u201d But Sharon Anderson, a member of the \u201cFront Row Joes\u201d group that travels the country to see Trump and who was attending her 29th rally Saturday, including the one held Jan. 6, disagreed. While she doesn\u2019t \u201cput a lot of faith in some of their beliefs,\u201d she took no issue with QAnon\u2019s growing presence at the rallies. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people, a big group that comes to his rallies. And they are for him, too. They\u2019re for his policies. Now whether they are trying to push their beliefs, I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Anderson, who lives in East Tennessee. \u201cBut I do know that everybody here that I\u2019ve encountered supports Donald J. Trump. That\u2019s what matters.\u201d",

    "Officials: US to send Ukraine more advanced rocket systems": [
        "By LOLITA C. BALDOR and MATTHEW LEEOctober 3, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The U.S. will soon deliver to Ukraine four more of the advanced rocket systems credited with helping the country\u2019s military gain momentum in its war with Russia. The High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, known as HIMARS, will be part of a new $625 million package of aid expected to be announced on Tuesday, according to U.S. officials. The decision marks the first time the U.S. has sent more HIMARS to Ukraine since late July, and it will bring the total number delivered so far to 20. The systems have become a key tool in Ukraine\u2019s ability to strike bridges that Russia has used to supply its troops, enabling Ukrainian forces to make inroads in Russia-controlled regions. The U.S. in recent weeks also provided funding through a separate program \u2014 the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative \u2014 so another 18 HIMARS can be purchased through longer-term contracts. USAI funds are being used as part of the effort by the U.S. and Western allies to ensure Ukraine\u2019s forces are trained and equipped to defend their country in the years to come. But those contracts will take several years to fulfill. The latest aid package is also expected to include other ammunition and equipment for Ukraine\u2019s troops. Several U.S. officials spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details of the package ahead of the announcement. This is the first tranche of U.S. aid delivered in the new fiscal year, which began Oct. 1. Ukraine has pressed its counteroffensive in the Kherson region since the summer, relentlessly pummeling Russian supply lines and making inroads into Russian-held areas west of the Dnieper River. Ukrainian troops have been using the HIMARS to repeatedly hit the main bridge across the Dnieper and a dam that served as a second crossing. It also has struck pontoon bridges that Russia has used to supply its troops. Ukraine\u2019s battlefield successes in Kherson are notable since that is one of the four areas that Russia is in the process of annexing. A senior U.S. military official said Monday that the attacks by Ukrainian forces have forced Russia into a \u201cdefensive crouch\u201d in Kherson, hampering Russian efforts to resupply their frontline troops. The official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity to provide a U.S. military assessment of the war, said that so far the U.S. has seen only small numbers of Russian reinforcements coming into Ukraine in an effort to shore up their defenses. Russia has said it will mobilize upwards of 300,000 conscripts to send to Ukraine. The official also said that despite persistent Russian threats to use nuclear force, the U.S. has seen no moves by the Kremlin that would cause the U.S. to change its own nuclear posture.",

    "High court will hear social media terrorism lawsuits": [
        "October 3, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court said Monday it will hear two cases seeking to hold social media companies financially responsible for terrorist attacks. The cases are seen as an important test of the federal law that generally makes internet companies exempt from liability for the material users post on their networks. In the cases the court agreed to hear, relatives of people killed in terrorist attacks in France and Turkey had sued Google, Twitter, and Facebook. They accused the companies of helping terrorists spread their message and radicalize new recruits. One of the cases was thrown out, mostly under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, while the other was allowed to proceed. The court,which began its new term Monday, is expected to hear arguments in the cases this winter with decisions before the court recesses for the summer, usually in late June. One of the cases the justices will hear involves Nohemi Gonzalez, a 23-year-old U.S. citizen studying in Paris. The Cal State Long Beach student was one of 130 people killed in Islamic State group attacks in November 2015. The attackers struck cafes, outside the French national stadium and inside the Bataclan theater. Gonzalez died in an attack at La Belle Equipe bistro. Gonzalez\u2019s relatives sued Google, which owns YouTube, saying the platform had helped the Islamic State group by allowing it to post hundreds of videos that helped incite violence and recruit potential supporters. Gonzalez\u2019s relatives said that the company\u2019s computer algorithms recommended those videos to viewers most likely to be interested in them. But a judge dismissed the case and a federal appeals court upheld the ruling. The other case the court agreed to hear involves Jordanian citizen Nawras Alassaf. He died in the 2017 attack on the Reina nightclub in Istanbul where a gunman affiliated with the Islamic State killed 39 people. Alassaf\u2019s relatives sued Twitter, Google and Facebook for aiding terrorism, arguing that the platforms helped the Islamic State grow and did not go far enough in trying to curb terrorist activity on their platforms. A lower court let the case proceed. The cases are Reynaldo Gonzalez et al. v Google, 21-1333, and Twitter et al. v Mehier Taamneh, 21-1496.",

    "Georgia election probe enters new phase with search warrants": [
        "By KATE BRUMBACKOctober 3, 2022 GMT",
        " ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 The Georgia prosecutor investigating whether former President Donald Trump and his allies broke the law trying to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state is seeking search warrants in the case, a sign that thewide-ranging probehas entered a new phase. The revelation came Monday in acourt orderfiled by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney, who\u2019s overseeing the special grand jury seated to help the investigation. In an order sealing any search warrants and related documents from being made public, McBurney wrote that District Attorney Fani Willis\u2019 office is \u201cnow seeking to obtain and execute a series of search warrants, the affidavits for which are predicated on sensitive information acquired during the investigation.\u201d Disclosure of the information could compromise the investigation, McBurney wrote, \u201cby, among other things, causing flight from prosecution, destruction of or tampering with evidence, and intimidation of potential witnesses.\u201d It could also result in risks to the \u201csafety and well-being\u201d of people involved in the investigation, he wrote. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear who the targets of the search warrants are or whether any search warrants had yet to be approved by a judge. To obtain a search warrant, prosecutors must convince a judge they have probable cause that a crime occurred at the location where authorities want to search. As Willis\u2019 investigation ramps up, the public court filings in the case have provided a rare window into the workings of a special grand jury that meets behind closed doors. Willis, a Democrat, opened the investigation early last year, shortly after the release of a recording ofa Jan. 2, 2021, phone callin which Trump suggested that Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger could \u201cfind\u201d the votes needed to overturn his loss to Democrat Joe Biden. In addition to the Trump-Raffensperger call, Willis confirmed early on that she was investigatinga call that Republican U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina madeto Raffensperger, thesudden departure of the U.S. attorney in Atlantain early January 2021 and statements made during legislative committee meetings by people pushing debunked claims casting doubt on the legitimacy of the state\u2019s election. Court filings in recent months have also shown that Willis is interested in a slate of fake electors who signed a certificate in December 2020 falsely stating that Trump had won the state and that they were the state\u2019s \u201cduly elected and qualified\u201d electors. She said in a court filing that the 16 Georgia Republicans who signed that certificate have all been notified they are targets of the investigation, meaning they could face criminal charges. Attorneys for Rudy Giuliani, a former New York mayor and Trump lawyer, say theirclient has also been notified that he\u2019s a target of Willis\u2019 investigation. He appeared at state legislative committee hearings in December 2020 and made claims of election fraud in Georgia. Giuliani was also involved in coordinating the fake elector plan, Willis wrote in a court filing. Hetestified before the special grand juryin August. Willis\u2019 investigation has also expanded intoa breach of voting equipmentat the elections office in a rural Georgia county, some 200 miles southeast of Atlanta. Documents, emails, security video and deposition testimony produced in response to subpoenas in a long-running lawsuit have shown that lawyer Sidney Powell and other Trump allies hired a computer forensics team to go toCoffee Countyto make complete copies of data and software on elections equipment there. Willis isseeking testimony from Powelland has also requested documents from the company that employs the computer forensics team. Another thread Willis seems to be pursuing is alleged attempts to pressure a Fulton County election worker. A petition filed last month indicates shewants to question Harrison Floyd, a director of Black Voices for Trump. Willis said in the petition that Floyd and Trevian Kutti, whom Willis described as a Chicago-based \u201cpurported publicist,\u201d tried to pressure Ruby Freeman.Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea \u201cShaye\u201d Moss,were election workers falsely accused by Trump allies of pulling fraudulent ballots from a suitcase during ballot counting. As the investigation has progressed, a number of people who have been summoned to testifyhave tried to avoidtestifying. Most have been unsuccessful. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican who\u2019s facing a reelection challenge from Democrat Stacey Abrams,managed to delayhis testimony until after next month\u2019s election. Graham\u2019sattempt to fight his subpoenais currently pending before a federal appeals court. Willis has said in a court filing that she wants to talk to Graham about calls he made to Raffensperger and his staff in which he reportedly asked about \u201creexamining certain absentee ballots cast in Georgia in order to explore the possibility of a more favorable outcome for former President Donald Trump.\u201d Graham has denied any wrongdoing and said hisstatus as a senator shields himfrom having to testify. A number of high-ranking Georgia state officials,including Raffenspergerand Attorney General Chris Carr, have already testified before the special grand jury. Others in Trump\u2019s orbit who\u2019ve undergone questioning include attorneysJohn Eastmanand Kenneth Chesebro. And the panel is still expecting testimony from others, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. Willis has indicated she couldseek to compel testimony from Trumphimself. The former president hashired a legal team in Atlantaand last month disparaged the investigation as a \u201cstrictly political Witch Hunt!\u201d",

    "Top US regulators say crypto poses financial stability risks": [
        "By FATIMA HUSSEINOctober 3, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Top regulators on Monday recommended a series of new safeguards to ensure that a growing and unregulated cryptocurrency market doesn\u2019t imperil U.S. financial stability. Among seven major recommendations, regulators called on Congress to pass legislation that would address the systemic risks caused by the growth of stablecoins, which are a form of cryptocurrency pegged to the price of another financial asset, like the U.S. dollar or gold. Recent volatilityin the cryptocurrency market, especially in stablecoins, has made regulators particularly wary about the need for regulation as usage of the digital asset continues to grow. Members of the Financial Stability Oversight Council met Monday to approve the recommendations of a 125-page report created in response to President Joe Biden\u2019s Marchexecutive orderon digital assets. The report also calls for giving agencies greater regulatory power over cryptocurrencies and digital assets. The oversight council is an interagency group headed by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and includes Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the role of the council is to identify risks and emerging threats to U.S. financial stability. Powell, whohas recently saidstablecoins will need greater regulation as they become more widely used by consumers, said Monday that \u201cacting now will allow us to support responsible financial innovation while preserving financial stability.\u201d Yellen said, \u201cAs we\u2019ve painfully learned from history, innovation without adequate regulation can result in significant disruptions and harm to the financial system.\u201d At the start of the year, the council stated it would focus its efforts on researching and developing recommendations on digital asset issues, as more Americans invest in cryptocurrencies. Roughly 16% of adult Americans, or 40 million people, have invested in cryptocurrencies, according to a September 2021Pew Research Center poll. And 43% of men age 18-29 have put money into cryptocurrency. Last month, the Treasury Departmentissued a reportthat recommended the U.S. work on developing a digital dollar. Yellen said Treasury recommends that the U.S. \u201cadvance policy and technical work on a potential central bank digital currency, or CBDC, so that the United States is prepared if CBDC is determined to be in the national interest.\u201d More than 100 central banks around the world are considering a digital currency, but just a few have actually issued one.",

    "Supreme Court welcomes the public again, and a new justice": [
        "By JESSICA GRESKO and MARK SHERMANOctober 3, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014The Supreme Court began its new term Monday with a new justice on the bench,the public back in the courtroomand a spirited debate in a case that pits environmental protections against property rights. The new member of the court,Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, wasted no time engaging, asking questions throughout nearly two hours of arguments in the dispute over the nation\u2019s main anti-water pollution law, the Clean Water Act. Jackson, the court\u2019s first Black female justice, seemed to be generally aligned with the court\u2019s other liberal justices in favor of Justice Department arguments to preserve theauthority of the federal government to regulate wetlands under the Clean Water Act against a business-backed challenge. If Jackson was eager to show she was ready to participate, several conservative justices also provided a quick reminder of the balance of power on a court where they hold a 6-3 majority. They asked questions that were more skeptical of the regulation in a case that tests the reach of the law beyond rivers, lakes and streams. One issue in the case is how far wetlands can be from a larger body of water and still be subject to regulation. Jackson said she wanted to know \u201cwhy would Congress draw the coverage line between abutting wetlands and neighboring wetlands when the objective of the statute is to ensure the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation\u2019s waters?\u201d Under an opinion written by retired Justice Anthony Kennedy in 2006, regulators can require permits before allowing development on properties that don\u2019t abut waterways as long as they prove a significant connection to the waterways. Kennedy, who retired in 2018, was in the courtroom to hear some conservative justices appear to agree with the lawyer for an Idaho couple that Kennedy\u2019s opinion was vague and unworkable. Chief Justice John Roberts was unsatisfied by Justice Department lawyer Brian Fletcher\u2019s explanation of how to translate Kennedy\u2019s opinion into practice. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Roberts asked at one point. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, who once was a law clerk to Kennedy, also appeared inclined to side with Chantell and Michael Sackett, who have wanted to build a home close to Priest Lake in Idaho for 16 years and won an earlier round in their legal fight at the Supreme Court. Monday\u2019s arguments were the first time the justices were back hearing cases since issuing alandmark rulingstripping away women\u2019s constitutional protections for abortion. And for the first time in two and a half years, since thecourt closed in March 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic,the public was allowed inside the courtroom, although the court is continuing to provide live audio of arguments on its website. Because of the pandemic the court is still closed to the public outside of arguments. And two justices wore masks in court Monday: Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who has diabetes and has worn a mask in court consistently during the pandemic, and Justice Elena Kagan, who the court said tested negative for COVID-19 but had been exposed to someone with the virus. Anew stack of high-profile casesawaits the justices in the upcoming term. Several cases the court has agreed to hear involve race or elections or both, and the court has also agreed to hear a dispute that returns the issue of free speech and LGBTQ rights to the court. Also hanging over the justices is some unfinished business from last term: the leak of a draft of the abortion decision seven weeks before it was formally announced. Chief Justice John Roberts ordered an investigation, but the court has yet to provide an update. Jackson, for her part, has been waiting for months to fully begin her new rolesince being confirmed in Apriland sworn in whenJustice Stephen Breyer retired in June. Jackson\u2019s husband, Patrick, and her parents were in the audience Monday, as were the parents of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and his wife, Ashley. Jackson joins the court at a time of declining public support for the court. Polls following the court\u2019s abortion decision have shown a sharp drop in the court\u2019s approval rating and in people\u2019s confidence in the court as an institution. A poll over the summer found 43% of Americans saying they have hardly any confidence in the court, up from 27% earlier in the year. In addition to the abortion ruling, the court alsoexpanded gun rights,reined in the government\u2019s ability to fight climate changeand blocked a Biden administrationeffort to get workers at large companies vaccinated against COVID-19. This term\u2019s significant cases include a struggle over whether Alabama must draw an additional Black majority congressional district, set for arguments Tuesday, and a controversial Republican-led appeal that could dramatically change the way elections for Congress and the presidency are conducted by handing more power to state legislatures. There\u2019s also the case of a Colorado website designer who says her religious beliefs prevent her working with same-sex couples on their weddings. Next month, the justices will hear a challenge to the consideration of race in college admissions. ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court",
