    "Pentagon promotes critical race theory, gender identity 'insanity': GOP report": [
        " \n        By\n        Patrick Hauf   | Fox News ",
        " The Biden administration has launched extensive diversity and equity initiatives in the military that have popularized elements of critical race theory and gender identity and significantly weakened the U.S. armed forces, according to a report obtained exclusively by Fox News Digital. \"Our military\u2019s singular purpose is to \u2018provide for the common defense\u2019 of our nation,\" the report said. \"It cannot be turned into a left-wing social experiment. It cannot be used as a cudgel against America itself. And it cannot be paralyzed by fear of offending the sensibilities of Ivy League faculty lounges or progressive pundits. \"The world is a dangerous place, and the Biden administration\u2019s insanity is eroding our greatest source of security in it.\" AIR FORCE TO END BASIC TRAINING 'BEAST WEEK' IN FAVOR OF 36-HOUR FIELD TRAINING The report from Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, details how the military has allocated resources to root out extremism within its ranks as it promotes predominantly left-wing ideas on race and gender. This includes documentation on how military employees promoted critical race theory and espouse anti-White views. For example, less than a month after his appointment by President Biden, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin directed commanding officers and supervisors at all levels to schedule a day to discuss extremism. However, a report from the Biden administration, \"Countering Extremist Activity Working Group,\" later identified fewer than 100 cases of extremism from the 2.1 million active forces, a rate of .005%. The report finds that instructors at military academies use \"antiracist\" approaches to education that direct soldiers to center their understanding of American society on an acknowledgment of its racist past and present, the report said. The Department of Defense, however, has emphasized it does not teach critical race theory and is focused on challenging its military students intellectually and rooting out extremism. HOUSE REPUBLICAN DEMANDS WEST POINT CEASE CRITICAL RACE THEORY TRAININGS TO MILITARY CADETS Rubio said these race-based initiatives are a distraction and danger to American security. \"Rather than making the case for American greatness and protecting our nation, the military is parroting woke nonsense,\" Rubio told Fox News Digital. \"It\u2019s dumb, it doesn\u2019t work, and it\u2019s dangerous. We need to spend more time thinking about how to counter Chinese aircraft carriers and less time thinking about pronouns.\" Some examples of \"woke\" defense policies have spilled out into the press. Kelisa Wing, the chief diversity equity and inclusivity officer at the Department of Defense, has tweeted she is \"exhausted with these White folx\" and suggested Black people are incapable of racism, comments that sparked an ongoing probe at the agency. Bishop Garrison, another diversity official at the agency, has promoted elements of critical race theory through his praise of the 1619 Project, a controversial education project that describes slavery at the core of American history. This focus on diversity, the Republicans' report notes, even extends to the United States Special Operations Command, which oversees special operations conducted for national security. That group\u2019s Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan, which all agencies were required to submit in response to an executive order from Biden, stated that \"leaders must integrate diversity and inclusion efforts into unit goals, mission objectives, talent management initiatives and operational priorities for a successful implementation.\" SERVICE MEMBERS SOUND ALARM AGAINST 'EXTREMELY WOKE' MILITARY The report also notes that the military covers the costs of transgender procedures for its members and allows them to serve as transgender and use the bathroom of their preferred gender. Military recruitment videos in recent years have touted the military\u2019s inclusivity to LGBT members with the use of the rainbow pride flag. A U.S. military base in Germany this year scheduled a drag queen story hour for children at its library but canceled the event after it faced public backlash. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Roy said this broad politicization of the military is a distraction from its focus on national security. \"The Department of Defense's priority should be training the men and women of our Armed Forces to be a united, lethal and battle-ready force primed to defend the United States and her interests at a moment's notice,\" Roy told Fox News Digital. \"Instead, Biden's woke Pentagon is using taxpayer dollars to promote blatant anti-American ideology.\"",

Lake told The Daily Mail on Saturday that she still believes she will become governor of Arizona.

        " \n        By\n        Anders Hagstrom   | Fox News ",
        " Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., says former President Donald Trump \"was right\" to go after the China-owned video-sharing app TikTok. Warner made the comments during an appearance on Fox News Sunday, telling host Shannon Bream that the app represents a major threat to Americans' privacy. He also warned parents against allowing their children to download the app on their phones. \"Well, I think Donald Trump was right. I mean, TikTok is an enormous threat,\" Warner told Bream. \"So, if you're a parent, and you've got a kid on TikTok, I would be very, very concerned. All of that data that your child is inputting and receiving is being stored somewhere in Beijing.\" Warner is only the most recent in a series of U.S. politicians and officials to call for a crackdown on TikTok. FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr called on regulators to ban the app in the U.S., and FBI Director Christopher Wray warned that it contributes to China's status as the No. 1 thief of U.S. data in the world. \"China\u2019s vast hacking program is the world\u2019s largest, and they have stolen more Americans\u2019 personal and business data than every other nation combined,\" Wray told lawmakers last week, adding specifically of TikTok: \"[Dangers] include the possibility that the Chinese government could use it to control data collection on millions of users or control the recommendation algorithm, which could be used for influence operations if they so chose or to control software on millions of devices, which gives the opportunity to potentially tactically compromise personal devices.\" STUDY FINDS 10% OF US ADULTS USE TIKTOK TO GET THEIR NEWS REGULARLY, UP FROM 3% IN 2020 Wray's statement came just weeks after Carr called for the U.S. to outright ban TikTok, arguing that efforts to separate its U.S.-based branch from its headquarters in China were pointless. TIKTOK ADDICTION: EXPERTS WEIGH IN ON THE SOCIAL MEDIA CRAZE AND WHAT'S BEHIND THE APP'S \u2018MASSIVE\u2019 INFLUENCE \"I don\u2019t believe there is a path forward for anything other than a ban,\" he told Axios at the time, adding that there isn't \"a world in which you could come up with sufficient protection on the data that you could have sufficient confidence that it\u2019s not finding its way back into the hands of the [Chinese Communist Party].\" TikTok pushed back on Carr in a statement to FOX Business, arguing that the commissioner has no role in discussions with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). The FCC has no authority to regulate TikTok, which is why Carr and others critical of Chinese apps have urged other federal agencies and Congress to take action. While TikTok representatives have insisted that users' data are safe, executives for the company have admitted under oath that the data is accessible from China. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP That access is used frequently as well, as was revealed in an extensive report from BuzzFeed earlier this year. The outlet obtained audio from more than 80 internal meetings at TikTok, showing that U.S. employees were not permitted to access user data and instead relied on Chinese employees to do so.",

It is common practice for the White House to absorb outgoing members of Congress following midterms, and Biden's administration already features several Capitol Hill alumni.

        " \n        By\n        Tyler Olson   | Fox News ",
        " High-ranking Democrats are pressing the Supreme Court to respond to allegations that Justice Samuel Alito leaked the result of a 2014 case to conservative activists, which they say highlights an \"inexcusable Supreme Court loophole in ethics rules.\" Alito has denied he leaked the opinion and said the allegation is \"completely false.\" But Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., and Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., asked Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts for more details about the allegation in a letter they sent Sunday. Whitehouse and Johnson said a July letter from a former conservative activist to Roberts alleging that Alito leaked the result of the Burwell v. Hobby Lobby case before it was final raises serious ethical questions the court must answer. GEORGIA JUDGE BLOCKS STATE'S LAW OUTLAWING MOST ABORTIONS AFTER SIX WEEKS \"Recent reporting by the New York Times that the orchestrators of this judicial lobbying campaign may have used their access to certain justices to secure confidential information about pending cases only deepens our concerns about the lack of adequate ethical and legal guardrails at the Court,\" Johnson and Whitehouse wrote in their letter, which was first reported by Politico. \"Moreover, it appears that the Court was alerted to these allegations as early as July 2022, when Chief Justice Roberts received a letter from the former leader of this lobbying operation,\" they added. The lawmakers demanded that Roberts answer whether the court has \"opened an investigation\" into Alito allegedly leaking the Hobby Lobby ruling; dinners and travel allegedly received from the justices by activists seeking to influence decisions; and whether donations to and membership in the Supreme Court Historical Society are being used to influence cases. Whitehouse and Johnson also referenced a previous letter that they sent to Roberts asking about potential unethical or illegal conduct from Supreme Court justices. They said Roberts didn't adequately respond to their questions and demanded more detail on those queries. \u2018JEOPARDY!\u2019 CONTESTANTS LEAVE CNN HOSTS OUTRAGED AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHO KETANJI BROWN JACKSON IS Alito has flatly denied that he had leaked the result of the Hobby Lobby case to conservative donor Gayle Wright. Former conservative religious leader Robert Schneck said in the letter published by The Times that Wright informed him of the outcome of the case. \"The allegation that the Wrights were told the outcome of the decision in the Hobby Lobby case, or the authorship of the opinion of the Court, by me or my wife is completely false,\" Alito said. \"My wife and I became acquainted with the Wrights some years ago because of their strong support for the Supreme Court Historical Society, and since then, we have had a casual and purely social relationship.\" \"I never detected any effort on the part of the Wrights to obtain confidential information or to influence anything that I did in either an official or private capacity, and I would have strongly objected if they had done so,\" Alito added. \"I have no knowledge of any project that they allegedly undertook for \u2018Faith and Action,\u2019 \u2018Faith and Liberty,\u2019 or any similar group, and I would be shocked and offended if those allegations are true.\" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, D-Ill., is also weighing in on the issue, and says Congress could act on legislation to implement more strict ethics rules on justices. \"The Senate Judiciary committee is reviewing these serious allegations, which highlight once again the inexcusable \u2018Supreme Court loophole\u2019 in federal judicial ethics rules,\" Durbin said. \"It is unacceptable that members of the highest court in the land are exempted from the judicial code of ethics,\" Durbin added. \"Congress should pass Senator Murphy's Supreme Court Ethics Act, which would require the court to adopt a code of ethics for Supreme Court justices.\" WHITE HOUSE FILES SUPREME COURT EMERGENCY APPEAL TO RESCUE $500B STUDENT DEBT HANDOUT CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP These allegations against Alito come as the Supreme Court still has not gotten to the bottom of who leaked the result of the Dobbs v.

He said the leak was a \"betrayal of the confidences of the Court\" and \"a singular and egregious breach of that trust that is an affront to the Court and the community of public servants who work here.\" Fox News reported in July that the probe had narrowed to a smaller group of people, and Justice Neil Gorsuch said at a legal gathering in Colorado in September he expected a report on the leak \"soon.\" Fox News' Shannon Bream and Bill Mears contributed to this report.",

        " Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Monday that Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., would be right to remove Democrats Ilhan Omar, Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell from their committee assignments. McCarthy said Sunday he would take the action when he becomes speaker of the GOP-controlled House. 3 HOUSE REPUBLICANS SAY THEY WON'T SUPPORT MCCARTHY FOR SPEAKER NEWT GINGRICH: I think Nancy Pelosi set the precedent. She did something that had never been done before and reached into the minority party to decide who could and could not serve on some committees. I think Kevin McCarthy is following her precedent. So the Democrats have nothing to complain about because they started this dance and frankly, the three people he's picked so totally deserve to be kicked off committees.\u00a0 It's unbelievable. Adam Schiff made a career out of lying to the American people while serving as chairman of the Intelligence Committee without any question, just plain, flat-out lying. Swalwell has had a relationship with a Chinese communist. That's unimaginable for somebody who's going to have security clearance. And of course, Omar is a viciously anti-Israel, antisemitic orator who has consistently violated the norms of civilized behavior. So I think those are three pretty good targets.

        " \n        By\n        Anders Hagstrom   | Fox News ",
        " President Biden condemned gun violence and attacks on the LGBTQ community following Saturday's mass shooting at Club Q in Colorado on Sunday. The president acknowledged that \"no motive\" had yet been determined in the shooting, but nevertheless connected the attack to the mass shooting at Pulse nightclub in Florida six years ago. Police say 22-year-old Anderson Lee Aldrich killed at least five people and injured 18 more in his assault on the nightclub. \"While no motive in this attack is yet clear, we\u00a0know that the LGBTQI+ community has been subjected to horrific hate violence in recent years,\" Biden wrote. \"Gun\u00a0violence continues\u00a0to have a devastating and particular impact on\u00a0LGBTQI+ communities across our nation and threats of violence are increasing.\u00a0We saw it six\u00a0years ago in Orlando, when our nation suffered the deadliest attack affecting the LGBTQI+ community in American history.\" \"We must address the public health epidemic of gun violence in all of its forms. Earlier this year, I signed the most significant gun safety law in nearly three decades, in addition to taking other historic actions. But we must do more. We need to enact an assault weapons ban to get weapons of war off America\u2019s streets,\" he added. CO MAN EXPERIENCING A MENTAL HEALTH EPISODE DIES AFTER ENCOUNTER WITH CRISIS TEAM Biden's statement came just after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also addressed the attack, calling it a \"senseless slaughter of five beautiful souls.\" \"The attack on Club Q, which fell\u00a0on the eve of Transgender Day of Remembrance, is despicable \u2014 further shattering the sense of safety of LGBTQ Americans across the country,\"\u00a0she wrote in a statement. \"While Democrats have taken important steps to combat gun violence this Congress, this deadly attack is a challenge to our conscience and a reminder that we must keep fighting to do more.\" COLORADO MAN ARRESTED IN SHOOTING THAT KILLED 12-YEAR-OLD, INJURED 14-YEAR-OLD: POLICE Authorities say no motive has been determined for Saturday's shooting so far, and they are still investigating whether it was a hate crime. Aldrich is currently in custody and receiving treatment for injuries at a local hospital in Colorado Springs. Colorado Springs Police Chief Adrian Vasquez says at least two \"heroic\" patrons were able to subdue Aldrich just before police arrived. Police say they received the first call regarding the attack at 11:56 p.m. on Saturday, and the first officer was dispatched to the scene at 11:57. The officer arrived to the scene at 12:02 a.m. and took the already-subdued suspect into custody before calling for more support. The investigation is in its early stages, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation is on the scene to assist. Many have concluded the shooting was motivated by anti-LGBTQ bias, including the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD). \"You can draw a straight line from the false and vile rhetoric about LGBTQ people spread by extremists and amplified across social media, to the nearly 300 anti-LGBTQ bills introduced this year, to the dozens of attacks on our community like this one,\" GLAAD\u2019s president and CEO, Sarah Kate Ellis, said in a statement to the Denver Post.

        " \n        By\n        Michael Lee   | Fox News ",
        " Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., sided with the Biden administration's argument that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was protected by sovereign immunity from lawsuits filed against him in the death of U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi. \"What the administration decided this week in granting sovereign immunity to Mohammed bin Salman\u2019 is in keeping with the practice and custom of lawsuits involving foreign heads of state,\" Cotton said during an appearance on Fox News Sunday. Cotton's comments come after the State Department on Thursday said the administration's determination the Saudi leader had sovereign immunity from U.S. courts in Khashoggi\u2019s killing is a \"purely a legal determination\" with long-standing legal precedent. The Arkansas senator agreed, saying it \"would have been a major break from those customs to not grant that kind of immunity.\" WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY EXPLAINS DECISION TO REQUEST IMMUNITY FOR CROWN PRINCE IN KILLING OF KHASHOGGI \"What I would say is Saudi Arabia is far from the world's worst abuser of human rights,\" Cotton said. \"You look at what's been happening in Iran for the last three months, for instance, and the way they've massacred protesters in the streets or what China does to harvest organs or to commit genocide against religious and ethnic minorities.\" Cotton pointed out that Saudi Arabia has been one of the U.S.'s most critical security partners even though they don't always share American values, arguing the U.S. wouldn't have many partners if countries were expected to 100% align with America's democratic system. \"What matters most about governments around the world is less whether they're democratic or not democratic and more whether they're pro-American or anti-American,\" Cotton said. \"The simple fact is Saudi Arabia has been an American partner going back 80 years.\" Cotton noted that his stance does not \"mean that we overlook or excuse countries that are pro-American,\" arguing they can be nurtured into democratic countries over time. BIDEN ADMINISTRATION REQUESTS IMMUNITY FOR SAUDI CROWN PRINCE IN KHASHOGGI KILLING: 'BEYOND IRONIC' The Biden administration's position on the issue has proved controversial, with Washington Post CEO Fred Bryan saying the decision fails \"to uphold America's most cherished values.\" \"He's granting license to kill to one of the world's most egregious human rights abusers,\" Bryan said of President Biden.\u00a0 Biden has seemingly struggled to balance the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia in recent months, most notably after the country went against the president's wishes to ramp up the supply of oil in response to surging prices. The 2018 killing of Khashoggi has become another focal point in the often tense relationship between Biden and Saudi Arabia, with Biden previously vowing on the campaign trail to make a \"pariah\" out of Saudi rulers over the issue.

    "Georgia appeals ruling on Saturday early voting for runoff": [
        "By KATE BRUMBACKNovember 21, 2022 GMT",
        " ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Georgia is appealing a judge\u2019s ruling that allows counties to offer early voting this coming Saturday in the U.S. Senate runoff election between Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker. Warnock\u2019s campaign, along with the Democratic Party of Georgia and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, sued the state last week, arguing that early voting should be allowed that day. They were challenging guidance from Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger that said state law doesn\u2019t allow voting this Saturday because it\u2019s the day after a state holiday.  That day is the only possibility for Saturday voting before next month\u2019s Senate runoff election between Warnock and Walker. Thursday is Thanksgiving, and Friday is a state holiday. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Thomas Cox on Friday issued an order siding with the Warnock campaign and the Democratic groups. Lawyers for the state on Monday filed a notice of appeal to the Georgia Court of Appeals. Warnock and Walker, a former football player, were forced into a Dec. 6 runoff because neither won a majority in the midterm election this month.  Georgia\u2019s 2021 election law compressed the time period between the general election and the runoff to four weeks, and Thanksgiving falls in the middle. Many Georgians will be offered only five weekdays of early in-person voting beginning Nov. 28.",

    "Obama to campaign for Warnock on Dec. 1 before Ga. runoff": [
        "By BILL BARROWNovember 21, 2022 GMT",
        " ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Former President Barack Obama, reprising his battleground blitz ahead of the midterm elections, will campaign again for Sen. Raphael Warnock as the Georgia Democrat tries to withstand a strong challenge from Republican Herschel Walker before their Dec. 6 runoff. Obama\u2019s return trip to Georgia is scheduled for Dec. 1, the eve of the final day of early in-person voting that has proven critical to Democrats in recent years, including Warnock\u2019s runoff special election victory nearly two years ago. Obama first appeared with Warnock in late October during the general election early voting period.  Warnock led Walker by about 36,000 votes in the general election but fell short of a majority, triggering a runoff under Georgia law.  Obama is the only significant national Democrat to campaign in person for Warnock, who has spent much of his reelection bid aiming for independent voters and even moderate Republicans, in addition to Democrats\u2019 core supporters. Republicans, in turn, have sought to frame the race more as a national referendum on the two parties, tying Warnock to President Joe Biden and generationally high inflation. Democrats managed to defend their Senate majority, already securing 50 seats -- along with Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 tie-breaking vote -- and managing to limit Republicans to a threadbare majority in the House. But Georgia remains a key seat because a 51st senator would give Democrats an outright majority, including on Senate committees, while giving the caucus insurance against defections. Warnock and other Democrats around the country embraced Obama as well-positioned to carry the party\u2019s banner because he remains intensely popular among the Democratic base and is still well-regarded among independents. Trying to capitalize on that standing before the general election, Obama took on the GOP framing of voters\u2019 midterm choice, arguing that Republicans were offering no real solutions to inflation that the former president stressed is a global phenomenon, not something that Biden and Democrats in Washington created. Obama also called Republicans a threat to democracy, pointing to many GOP leaders\u2019 continued support for former President Donald Trump and his false claims that the 2020 election was fraudulent. In Georgia specifically, Obama hammered Walker, a celebrity athlete turned politician, as woefully unprepared for the Senate, an argument Warnock is pressing both in his campaign speeches and in paid advertising.  Walker has welcomed a parade of national Republican figures, including multiple visits from Sens. Rick Scott of Florida, the GOP\u2019s Senate campaign chairman, and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. But he has not appeared with Trump, despite their long-running friendship and the former president encouraging Walker to run and then endorsing him.  Most early in-person voting for the runoff is expected to occur from Nov. 28 through Dec. 2, the week prior to the runoff Election Day. Some counties plan to open early voting sites as early as Tuesday, but many counties said they couldn\u2019t manage that in the days ahead of Thanksgiving. A state judge last week granted Democrats\u2019 request to allow early voting on the Saturday after Thanksgiving, though state officials have appealed. It\u2019s not clear how many local elections offices would be able to mobilize to stand up early sites on the holiday weekend even if they are allowed to do so.  ___ Associated Press reporter Darlene Superville contributed from Washington.

    "GOP\u2019s lackluster fundraising spurs post-election infighting": [
        "By BRIAN SLODYSKO and AARON KESSLERNovember 21, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Trailing badly in his Arizona Senate race as votes poured in, Republican Blake Masters went on Tucker Carlson\u2019s Fox News program and assigned blame to one person: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.  \u201cYou know what else is incompetent, Tucker? The establishment. The people who control the purse strings,\u201d Masters said before accusing the long-serving GOP leader and the super PAC aligned with him of not spending enough on TV advertising. \u201cHad he chosen to spend money in Arizona, this race would be over. We\u2019d be celebrating a Senate majority right now.\u201d Masters not only lost his race against Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly. He trailed every other Republican running for statewide office in Arizona. But there\u2019s another problem Masters didn\u2019t acknowledge: He failed to raise significant money on his own.  He was hardly alone.  As both parties sift through the results of Democrats\u2019 stronger-than-expected showing in the midterm elections, Republicans are engaged in a round of finger-pointing, including a failed attempt by Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who led the Senate GOP\u2019s campaign arm, to challenge McConnell for his leadership post.  But the recriminations obscure a much deeper dilemma for the party. Many of their nominees \u2014 a significant number of whom were first-time candidates who adopted far-right positions \u2014 failed to raise the money needed to mount competitive campaigns. That forced party leaders, particularly in the Senate, to make hard choices and triage resources to races where they thought they had the best chance at winning, often paying exorbitant rates to TV stations that, by law, would have been required to sell the same advertising time to candidates for far less. The lackluster fundraising allowed Democrats to get their message out to voters early and unchallenged, while GOP contenders lacked the resources to do the same. \u201cThis has become an existential and systemic problem for our party and it\u2019s something that needs to get addressed if we hope to be competitive,\u201d said Steven Law, a former McConnell chief of staff who now leads Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC that spent at least $232 million on advertising to elect Republicans to the Senate this year. \u201cOur (donors) have grown increasingly alarmed that they are being put in the position of subsidizing weak fundraising performances by candidates in critical races. And something has got to give. It\u2019s just not sustainable,\u201d Law said. In key Senate and House battlegrounds, Democratic candidates outraised their Republican counterparts by a factor of nearly 2-to-1, according to an Associated Press analysis of campaign finance data.  Consider the handful of races that helped Democrats retain their Senate majority.  In Arizona, Masters was outraised nearly 8-to-1 by Kelly, who poured at least $32 million into TV advertising from August until Election Day, records show. Masters spent a little over $3 million on advertising during the same period after Senate Leadership Fund pulled out of the race  Meanwhile, in Nevada, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto raised $52.8 million compared to Republican Adam Laxalt\u2019s $15.5 million. And in Pennsylvania, Democratic Sen.-elect John Fetterman took in $16 million more than his GOP opponent, Dr. Mehmet Oz. That\u2019s despite the celebrity TV doctor lending $22 million to his campaign, records show. Similar disparities emerged in crucial House races, including in Nevada, Pennsylvania and Virginia, helping to limit House Republicans to a surprisingly narrow majority.  When it came to purchasing TV ad time, Democrats\u2019 fundraising advantage yielded considerable upside. Ad sellers are required, by law, to offer candidates the cheapest rate. That same advantage doesn\u2019t apply to super PACs, which Republican candidates relied on to close their fundraising gap \u2014 often at a premium.  In Las Vegas, for example, a candidate could buy a unit of TV advertising for $598, according to advertising figures provided to the AP. That same segment cost a super PAC $4,500. In North Carolina\u2019s Raleigh-Durham media market, a $342 spot cost a super PAC $1,270. And a $580 candidate segment in the Philadelphia area cost a super PAC nearly $2,000, the advertising figures show.  Republicans also found themselves playing defense in states that weren\u2019t ultimately competitive.  J.D. Vance, who won his Ohio Senate race by more than 6 percentage points, was outraised nearly 4-to-1 by Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan. To shore him up, Senate Leadership Fund poured $28 million into the state. The group\u2019s advertising ultimately accounted for about 70% of all Republican media spending from August until Election Day.  A similar situation played out in North Carolina, where the McConnell-aligned super PAC was responsible for 82% of the Republican advertising spending during the same period. GOP Rep. Ted Budd won by over 3% of the vote. But money woes weren\u2019t the only complicating factor.  Donald Trump elevated a series of untested, first-time candidates. They included Masters, Vance and former NFL star Herschel Walker, whose complicated backstory includes threats of violence against his ex-wife, false claims of business success and allegations that he twice pressured a girlfriend to get an abortion, which Walker denies. Then there was Oz, who moved to Pennsylvania to seek the seat and also secured Trump\u2019s endorsement, but was pilloried by Democrats as an out-of-touch carpetbagger.  The former president gave them his endorsement, but he was parsimonious when it came to sharing some of the more than $100 million he\u2019s amassed in a committee designed to help other candidates. He ended up spending about $15 million on ads across five Senate races, records show.  Meanwhile, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, led by Scott, often worked at cross-purposes with McConnell\u2019s political operation. Early on, Scott ruled out getting involved in primaries, which he saw as inappropriate meddling. McConnell\u2019s allies, meanwhile, moved to fend off candidates they saw as poor general-election contenders, like Don Bolduc, a far-right conservative who lost his New Hampshire race last week by nearly 10 percentage points. McConnell forces also defended Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a GOP moderate, against a conservative challenger. \u201cSenate races are just different,\u201d McConnell said in August. \u201cCandidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome.\u201d  In response, Scott took a shot at McConnell without mentioning him by name, suggesting in an opinion article published in the Washington Examiner that any \u201ctrash-talking\u201d of Republican candidates was an \u201cact of cowardice\u201d that was \u201ctreasonous to the conservative cause.\u201d But his committee also struggled after making a series of bad bets, including a costly investment to boost the committee\u2019s online fundraising. An internal document obtained by the AP, which was previously reported by The New York Times, shows the committee invested $23.3 million to build out their digital fundraising program between June and January of 2021. But the NRSC raised just $6.1 million during that time \u2014 a deficit. Then, as inflation soared, the stream of cash from online donors slowed to a trickle. Chris Hartline, an NRSC spokesman, said the document showed a direct return from one part of the investment and did not reflect the total raised through the program, which he said topped more than $15 million, a figure that is still lower than what the committee put into the effort.  That prevented the NRSC from spending as much on TV ads as in years past, even as Scott made bullish predictions of picking up as many as five Senate seats. The digital fundraising effort was a boon, however, for consultants, who collected at least $31 million in payments, disclosures show.  Some Republican senators are now clamoring for an audit of the committee. In an at-times heated Senate GOP lunch at the Capitol last week, Maine Sen. Susan Collins questioned Scott\u2019s management of the NRSC. Scott\u2019s aides dismissed suggestions of financial impropriety, saying that the payments to consultants were ordinary and part of the effort to grow the NRSC\u2019s online fundraising. They also accuse McConnell of undercutting the committee. During a Senate GOP lunch in August, Scott asked senators for donations to the NRSC, which is now at least $20 million in debt. Then McConnell addressed the room and told the senators to instead prioritize giving to Senate Leadership Fund, according to two people familiar with the discussion; they requested anonymity to describe it. The interaction was part of a broader pattern by McConnell to sabotage the NRSC, said Hartline, the NRSC spokesman. \u201cThere was a very clear implication to donors that they should not give to the NRSC,\u201d Hartline said. \u201cAnd the result is it hurt our ability to boost our candidates and get their message out.\u201d  Scott has also said improper bonuses were paid out by the committee before he took over. And in a statement he suggested that the Senate Leadership Fund, McConnell\u2019s super PAC, should be audited, too.  McConnell allies, however, believe Scott has ulterior motives and has used his post to burnish his own image at the expense of the party, potentially working to set himself up for a presidential bid, according to senior Republicans strategists. They were not authorized to discuss the McConnell allies\u2019 conclusions and did so on condition of anonymity. The gambit failed, as did Scott\u2019s challenge of McConnell\u2019s leadership position last week.  Faced with the prospect of solidifying their majority with another seat during a December runoff election in Georgia, Democrats were happy to offer unsolicited guidance to Republicans.  \u201cMy advice is to keep on doing what they are doing,\u201d said Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, who led Senate Democrats\u2019 campaign arm this year.",

    "GOP sees slight Latino vote gains, painful candidate losses": [
        "By ADRIANA GOMEZ LICON and ACACIA CORONADONovember 20, 2022 GMT",
        " MIAMI (AP) \u2014 Republicans had placed hopes on a roster of Latina candidates around the country as they looked to make gains with Latino voters in a midterm election that some had predicted would yield sweeping GOP victories. The verdict was mixed. While Republican House candidates made modest inroads among Latino voters in 2022 compared with 2018, several GOP Latina candidates in high-profile races lost.  Overall, the House will see a net gain of at least eight Latino members, with seven of them being Democrats, according to a tally by the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials.  With the additions, the Republican Party will now have 11 Latino House members, while Democrats will have 35, with one race featuring a Democratic Latino still undecided, NALEO said. That will bring the total Latino representation in Congress to 11%, lower than the 19% Latino population in the U.S. \u201cIt obviously is not the outcome many of us were expecting, but it still brings hope,\u201d said Wadi Gaitan, communications director for the conservative group Libre Initiative, which mobilizes Latino voters to help get Republicans elected. \u201cInroads inspire Latinos and Latinas to look for office.\u201d The blows were felt in Texas and in Virginia, where Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger prevailed over Republican Yesli Vega, a daughter of Salvadoran immigrants, in one of the country\u2019s most expensive and competitive races. Vega, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, is a former police officer who co-chaired Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin\u2019s Latino voter coalition last year. In South Texas, Democrats held on to two of three heavily Latino districts aggressively targeted by Latina Republican candidates, who dubbed themselves the \u201cspicy tacos\u201d after a comment by first lady Jill Biden that Latinos were \u201cas unique\u201d as San Antonio breakfast tacos. She later apologized for the remark. The GOP scored a victory with Latina businesswoman Monica de la Cruz winning a newly redrawn district there. But in a rare race between two sitting members of Congress \u2014 both Latinos \u2014 in a Democratic-leaning district, Republican U.S. Rep. Mayra Flores was ousted. Flores, who made history in a special election earlier this year by becoming the first Mexican-born congresswoman, said the heavily Hispanic region has always been conservative, with a focus on faith and family values, leading to a growing GOP impact. \u201cThe future of South Texas is Republican. We didn\u2019t go backwards,\u201d Flores said. \u201cLittle by little, we are going to make bigger impacts.\u201d  Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott earned a slightly larger percentage of Latino voters in 2022 than he did four years ago, 42% now vs. 35% then, according to AP VoteCast, an expansive survey of almost 3,400 voters in the state. Dorian Caal, director of civic engagement research at NALEO, cautions against making wide assumptions, saying the real breakdown of Latino support needs to be analyzed down to precincts, which can take time.  \u201cIt really comes down to not taking the Latino vote for granted,\u201d Caal said. In Florida, Republicans invested heavily and gains were pronounced, according to AP VoteCast. More than half of Latino voters backed Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, compared with fewer than half in 2020 supporting Trump. DeSantis earned a somewhat higher percentage of Latino voters this year than he did in 2018. He also became the first Republican governor since Jeb Bush in 2002 to win Miami-Dade, the state\u2019s largest county and one with an influential immigrant population. Many analysts highlighted the landslide victory in Florida, saying the GOP needs to replicate the model around the country. While aligning with Trump may have hurt candidates in other areas, it helped them in Florida. Republicans increased their Latino representation in the House by adding Anna Paulina Luna, who has Mexican ancestry and won a newly redrawn district. Luna has said she believes Trump won the 2020 election and earlier this year promoted a film that has been discredited that claims people were paid to travel among drop boxes and stuff them with fraudulent ballots during the 2020 presidential vote. Another victory scored by the GOP turned into a milestone in Oregon when Republican Lori Chavez-DeRemer flipped a district red. She and Democrat Andrea Salinas, who won in another district, will be the first Latina congresswomen from Oregon. In Nevada, Democrats held on to Senate control with the victory of incumbent Catherine Cortez Masto, the first and only Latina in the Senate. Melissa Morales, founder of Somos PAC, a group that mobilizes Latino voters for Democrats, said Latinos were key in getting Cortez Masto reelected. Cortez Masto won 60% of Latino votes, according to AP VoteCast.  \u201cWe are not a sleeping giant. We are strategic giant,\u201d said Morales. \u201cAt the end of the day, there can always be more investment. That\u2019s what we will be pushing for.\u201d Back in South Texas, Democratic U.S. Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, who defeated Flores, shares the sentiment, saying the party must increase its investment in Latino communities and prioritize the \u201cmeat and potatoes\u201d issues that are important to local voters.  \u201cThe only way to turn more of Texas blue is raising large amounts of resources,\u201d Gonzalez said.  ___ Coronado reported from Austin, Texas.

    "Trump\u2019s growing GOP challengers revive fears of 2016 repeat": [
        "By STEVE PEOPLESNovember 20, 2022 GMT",
        " LAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 Memories of the tumultuous 2016 Republican primary hung over the Las Vegas ballroom this weekend during the first major gathering of the party\u2019s potential contenders for the 2024 nomination.  No fewer than 10 White House prospects stepped onto the stage to pitch their plans to fix the nation \u2014 and their party. The details varied, but within most speeches was an extraordinary sense of defiance rarely seen since former President Donald Trump seized control of the Republican Party six years ago. Their central message: Trump can and should be beaten. Nikki Haley, the former ambassador to the United Nations under Trump, pledged in April that she wouldn\u2019t challenge the former president if he ran again. But Saturday night, facing hundreds of cheering Republicans, she vowed to give \u201c1,000%\u201d to a White House bid if she decided to get in.  \u201cI\u2019ve never lost an election, and I\u2019m not going to start now,\u201d she said as the crowd roared. But as the donors and activists who gathered for the Republican Jewish Coalition\u2019s two-day leadership conference applauded, perhaps no one was cheering louder than Trump himself from his Florida estate. Trump\u2019s team believes, as do a growing number of anxious donors and Republican operatives, that the GOP\u2019s emboldened 2024 class may already be unintentionally re-creating the conditions that enabled Trump\u2019s success in 2016. That year, a crowded Republican field splintered the primary electorate and allowed Trump to become the party\u2019s presidential nominee despite winning just 35% or less of the vote in each of the three opening primary contests. In the earliest days of the 2024 season, the 2016 parallels are eerie. As then, Trump is viewed with suspicion within his party, his standing weakened considerably after several loyalists lost winnable races in this month\u2019s midterm elections. And most of all, a parade of ambitious Republicans is lining up to take him on.  A small, but growing group of Republican operatives is warning Trump\u2019s critics that the only way to defeat him is to rally behind a much smaller group of alternatives. Eric Levine, a New York-based donor who attended the weekend gathering, called on his party to embrace no more than two or three candidates \u2014 and to move with real urgency. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have the luxury of waiting,\u201d said Levine, who has raised millions of dollars for Republicans in recent years and began speaking out against Trump only after the midterms. \u201cIf he becomes the Republican brand, the party is going to be destroyed.\u201d  For now, at least, Trump\u2019s rivals don\u2019t appear to be heeding his warning.  The most popular alternative to Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, isn\u2019t likely to enter the race until the late spring, his allies say. But in his keynote address Saturday night, he left little doubt that 2024 was on his mind. \u201cIn times like these, there is no substitute for victory,\u201d DeSantis said, citing over and over his overwhelming midterm success in Florida. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot more to do, and I have only begun to fight.\u201d And in a series of interviews, several other would-be Republican candidates and their aides indicated they would likely wait until next spring or summer to enter the race should they decide to run. That\u2019s even after Trump formally launched his 2024 campaign this past week.  New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, who isn\u2019t ruling out a 2024 run, said Trump\u2019s early announcement has created no sense of urgency; it simply highlighted his weakened political standing.  \u201cI think all of us understand how little of a factor he\u2019s going to be,\u201d Sununu said in an interview. \u201cHe\u2019s not scaring anybody out. Anyone who wants to run is going to run. It\u2019ll be fun. It\u2019ll be a wide-open race.\u201d Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said it\u2019s much too early to worry about winnowing the field. \u201cI think more voices, more potential choices,\u201d said Hogan, who is openly weighing a 2024 bid after his term ends in January. \u201cTrump needs to be tested. People need to go out there and be willing to stand up to him.\u201d Hogan continued: \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s going to listen to narrowing the field. Everybody\u2019s going to say, \u2019I should be the guy, I should be the guy, we should all be the guy.\u201d Christie, a failed 2016 presidential contender who then went on to lead Trump\u2019s White House transition that year, said he ultimately expects seven or eight major candidates to enter the race, \u201cwhich is manageable\u201d compared with the 16 who ran against Trump in 2016. \u201cA lot of those people are fishing out of the Trump pond,\u201d Christie said, suggesting that prospects such as DeSantis and Mike Pompeo are \u201cMAGA guys\u201d who would steal support from Trump\u2019s base in a way that creates opportunities for others \u2014 like him.  Christie dismissed any talk of winnowing the field so soon.  \u201cWe should all rally behind someone? Okay, who? I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any obvious choice,\u201d Christie said. Trump advisers initially hoped that he might clear the field with his early announcement. They now believe a crowded field will help him by splitting the anti-Trump vote \u2014 just as was the case in 2016. Trump won the New Hampshire and South Carolina primary elections that year with just 35% and 32% of the vote, respectively. Seven others divided the overwhelming majority of the vote. Trump\u2019s team notes that his loyalists in key 2022 primary elections from Arizona to New Hampshire to Pennsylvania won their GOP nominations with between 30% and 40% of the vote \u2014 a base of support it believes continues to be his floor in the 2024 primary.  Former New Hampshire GOP Chair Jennifer Horn, who led the state party in 2016, said the growing number of likely 2024 candidates \u201cshould know better\u201d this time around. \u201cThey are feeding exactly the kind of environment that Trump needs to win,\u201d Horn warned. \u201cIf past is prologue, we\u2019ve all got reason to be concerned.\u201d And while there was evidence of Trump fatigue at the weekend conference, Trump received a warm reception when he appeared via teleconference on Saturday. The crowd cheered loudly when he noted his success in moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.  But there was notable silence when he repeated his baseless claims about his 2020 election loss.  \u201cThe election was rigged. And it\u2019s too bad it was, and Israel lost a lot,\u201d Trump told the packed ballroom. \u201cYou better hope that a certain person wins the election in 2024.\u201d  And with Trump already a declared candidate, some operatives worry it\u2019s much later than his challengers think.  The first presidential primary debate could be just nine months away, using the 2016 presidential primary as a guide. By the summer of 2015, there were already 17 candidates in the race. One of them was Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who is considering another run in 2024.  Speaking to reporters in Las Vegas, Cruz said Trump and his loyalists deserved some of the blame for the weaker-than-expected results in the midterms. \u201cI\u2019m frustrated when my party fields candidates with no realistic chance of success,\u201d Cruz said.  But when asked about the 2024 presidential contest, Cruz said only there were several candidates \u201cclearly positioning to run\u201d against Trump. \u201cI believe that voters can and should sort that out.\u201d Pompeo, Trump\u2019s former secretary of state, who is among those positioning themselves to run, slapped at the former president repeatedly on stage this weekend without mentioning his name directly. Instead, Pompeo said conservatives deserve leaders \u201cwho fight for them, not ourselves or our own egos.\u201d  And he acknowledged the looming 2024 primary.  \u201cWho knows, the next time we\u2019re together we could be on stage, multiple podiums,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cWho knows who else might be there and what nicknames we\u2019ll have?\u201d ___ AP writer Jill Colvin in New York contributed.

    "Lawmakers urge action after report of other high court leak": [
        "November 20, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee said his panel is reviewing \u201cserious allegations\u201d in a report that a former anti-abortion leader knew in advance the outcome of a 2014 Supreme Court case involving health care coverage of contraception. The report Saturday in The New York Times followed the stunning leak earlier this year of a draft opinion in the case in which the high court overturned Roe v. Wade, ending constitutional protections for abortion. That decision was written by Justice Samuel Alito, who is also the author of the majority opinion in the 2014 case at the center of the new report. In the Times story, Rev. Rob Schenck said he learned the outcome of the Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores case weeks before the decision was made public. In a 5-4 decision, Alito wrote that some companies with religious objections can avoid the contraceptives requirement in President Barack Obama\u2019s health care legislation.  Schenck, who previously headed the group Faith and Action, has said in other recent stories in Politico and Rolling Stone that he was part of a concerted effort to forge social and ministry relationships with conservative justices. In the Times story, Schenck said the information about the Hobby Lobby decision came from Gail Wright, a donor to his organization who was part of the outreach effort to the justices and who had dined with Alito and his wife. Wright herself denied obtaining or sharing any information in an interview with the Times. The New York Times also published a letter Schenck said he wrote Chief Justice John Roberts in July alerting him to the alleged breach years ago. Schenck wrote that he thought the information might be relevant as part of a probe into the leak of the abortion decision. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement Saturday that the committee is \u201creviewing these serious allegations,\u201d and he called on fellow members of Congress to pass a bill that would require the high court to adopt a code of ethics. Two fellow Democrats, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Rep. Hank Johnson of Georgia, who chair courts subcommittees, issued a statement calling the Times report \u201canother black mark on the Supreme Court\u2019s increasingly marred ethical record\u201d and said they \u201cintend to get to the bottom of these serious allegations.\u201d They too urged passage of a code of ethics. The Times\u2019 story included an emphatic denial by Alito that he\u2019d disclosed the outcome of the case. The court released Alito\u2019s full statement to The Associated Press: \u201cThe allegation that the Wrights were told the outcome of the decision in the Hobby Lobby case, or the authorship of the opinion of the Court, by me or my wife is completely false. My wife and I became acquainted with the Wrights some years ago because of their strong support for the Supreme Court Historical Society, and since then, we have had a casual and purely social relationship.  \u201cI never detected any effort on the part of the Wrights to obtain confidential information or to influence anything that I did in either an official or private capacity, and I would have strongly objected if they had done so. I have no knowledge of any project that they allegedly undertook for \u2018Faith and Action,\u2019 \u2018Faith and Liberty,\u2019 or any similar group, and I would be shocked and offended if those allegations are true,\u201d it said.  Schenck\u2019s Faith and Action group became Faith & Liberty after becoming part of the Liberty Counsel in 2018. Alito was appointed to the high court in 2006 by President George W. Bush.",

    "Musk restores Trump\u2019s Twitter account after online poll": [
        "By ALEX VEIGANovember 20, 2022 GMT",
        " LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Elon Musk reinstated Donald Trump\u2019s account on Twitter on Saturday, reversing a ban that has kept the former president off the social media site since a pro-Trump mob attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, as Congress was poised to certify Joe Biden\u2019s election victory. Musk made the announcement in the evening after holding a poll that asked Twitter users to click \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d on whether Trump\u2019s account should be restored. The \u201cyes\u201d vote won, with 51.8%. Previously, Musk had said Twitter would establish new procedures and a \u201ccontent moderation council\u201d before making decisions to restore suspended accounts. \u201cThe people have spoken. Trump will be reinstated. Vox Populi, Vox Dei,\u201d Musk tweeted, using a Latin phrase meaning \u201cthe voice of the people, the voice of God.\u201d Shortly afterward Trump\u2019s account, which had earlier appeared as suspended, reappeared on the platform complete with his former tweets, more than 59,000 of them. His followers were gone, at least initially, but he quickly began regaining them. There were no new tweets from the account as of late Saturday, however.  Musk restored the account less than a month after the Tesla CEO took control of Twitter and four days after Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 presidential race.  It is not clear whether Trump would actually return to Twitter. An irrepressible tweeter before he was banned, Trump has said in the past that he would not rejoin even if his account was reinstated. He has been relying on his own, much smaller social media site, Truth Social, which he launched after being blocked from Twitter. And on Saturday, during a video speech to a Republican Jewish group meeting in Las Vegas, Trump said that he was aware of Musk\u2019s poll but that he saw \u201ca lot of problems at Twitter.\u201d \u201cI hear we\u2019re getting a big vote to also go back on Twitter. I don\u2019t see it because I don\u2019t see any reason for it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt may make it, it may not make it,\u201d he added, apparently referring to Twitter\u2019s recent internal upheavals. The prospect of restoring Trump\u2019s presence to the platform follows Musk\u2019s purchase last month of Twitter \u2014 an acquisition that has fanned widespread concern that the billionaire owner will allow purveyors of lies and misinformation to flourish on the site. Musk has frequently expressed his belief that Twitter had become too restrictive of freewheeling speech. His efforts to reshape the site have been both swift and chaotic. Musk has fired many of the company\u2019s 7,500 full-time workers and an untold number of contractors who are responsible for content moderation and other crucial responsibilities. His demand that remaining employees pledge to \u201cextremely hardcore\u201d work triggered a wave of resignations, including hundreds of software engineers. Users have reported seeing increased spam and scams on their feeds and in their direct messages, among other glitches, in the aftermath of the mass layoffs and worker exodus. Some programmers who were fired or resigned this week warned that Twitter may soon fray so badly it could actually crash. Musk\u2019s online survey, posted on his own Twitter account, drew more than 15 million votes in the 24 hours in which it ran.  Musk conceded that the results were hardly scientific. \u201cBot & troll armies might be running out of steam soon,\u201d he tweeted Saturday morning. \u201cSome interesting lessons to clean up future polls.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s used Twitter polling to make business decisions. Last year he sold millions of shares of his Tesla stock after asking his followers whether he should. Democratic U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York responded to Musk\u2019s poll on Trump by tweeting video of the Jan. 6 insurrection. She tweeted Friday that when Trump was last on Twitter, it \u201cwas used to incite an insurrection, multiple people died, the Vice President of the United States was nearly assassinated, and hundreds were injured but I guess that\u2019s not enough for you to answer the question. Twitter poll it is.\u201d Trump lost his access to Twitter two days after his supporters stormed the Capitol, soon after the former president had exhorted them to \u201cfight like hell.\u201d Twitter dropped his account after Trump wrote a pair of tweets that the company said cast further doubts on the legitimacy of the presidential election and raised risks for the Biden presidential inauguration.  After the Jan. 6 attack, Trump was also kicked off Facebook and Instagram, which are owned by Meta Platforms, and Snapchat. His ability to post videos to his YouTube channel was also suspended. Facebook is set to reconsider Trump\u2019s suspension in January. Throughout his tenure as president, Trump\u2019s use of social media posed a significant challenge to major social media platforms that sought to balance the public\u2019s interest in hearing from public officials with worries about misinformation, bigotry, harassment and incitement of violence.  But in a speech at an auto conference in May, Musk asserted that Twitter\u2019s ban of Trump was a \u201cmorally bad decision\u201d and \u201cfoolish in the extreme.\u201d Earlier this month, Musk, who completed the $44 billion takeover of Twitter in late October, declared that the company wouldn\u2019t let anyone who had been kicked off the site return until Twitter had established procedures on how to do so, including forming a \u201ccontent moderation council.\u201d On Friday, Musk tweeted that the suspended Twitter accounts for the comedian Kathy Griffin, the Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson and the conservative Christian news satire website Babylon Bee had been reinstated. He added that a decision on Trump had not yet been made. He also responded \u201cno\u201d when someone on Twitter asked him to reinstate the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones\u2019 account. In a tweet Friday, the Tesla CEO described the company\u2019s new content policy as \u201cfreedom of speech, but not freedom of reach.\u201d He explained that a tweet deemed to be \u201cnegative\u201d or to include \u201chate\u201d would be allowed on the site but would be visible only to users who specifically searched for it. Such tweets also would be \u201cdemonetized, so no ads or other revenue to Twitter,\u201d Musk said. ___ This story has been corrected to reflect that the yes vote was 51.8%, not 51.2%. ",

    "US seeks expansion of military presence in Philippines": [
        "By JIM GOMEZNovember 21, 2022 GMT",
        " MANILA, Philippines (AP) \u2014 The United States is seeking an expansion of its military presence in the Philippines under a 2014 defense pact, U.S. and Philippine officials said, one of the initiatives Vice President Kamala Harris launched Monday during her visit to America\u2019s oldest treaty ally in Asia. Harries also reaffirmed Washington\u2019s commitment to defend the Philippines under the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty in talks with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. at the presidential palace in Manila.  The high-level assurance came a day after China\u2019s coast guard forcibly seized Chinese rocket debris that Filipino navy personnel found and were towing to a Philippines-occupied island in the disputed South China Sea. China, the Philippines and four other governments are locked in increasingly tense territorial disputes in the strategic waterway. \u201cAn armed attack on the Philippines armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft in the South China Sea would invoke U.S. Mutual Defense commitments,\u201d Harris told Marcos Jr. \u201cAnd that is an unwavering commitment that we have to the Philippines.\u201d Marcos Jr. thanked Harris. He said that given the upheavals in the region and beyond, \u201cthis partnership becomes even more important.\u201d On Tuesday, Harris flies to the western Philippine island province of Palawan, which faces the South China Sea, to showcase the level of concern America has for keeping the busy waterway open for commerce and navigation and to assure allies like the Philippines. China\u2019s increasingly aggressive actions to fortify its claims to most of the busy waterway have alarmed smaller claimant nations. The U.S. has been helping strengthen the Philippine coast guard, which said it would welcome Harris aboard one of its biggest patrol ships moored in Palawan. Harris and her delegation also announced a range of U.S. assistance and initiatives to help the Philippines deal with climate change and looming food and energy crises, including talks on a proposed agreement that would provide the legal basis for U.S. exports of nuclear equipment and material for energy to the Philippines. A former American colony, the Philippines used to host one of the largest U.S. Navy and Air Force bases outside the American mainland. The bases were shut down in the early 1990s after the Philippine Senate rejected an extension, but American forces returned for large-scale combat exercises with Filipino troops under a 1999 Visiting Forces Agreement. In 2014, the allies signed the Enhance Defense Cooperation Agreement, which allows larger numbers of American forces to stay in rotating batches within Philippine military camps, where they can build warehouses, living quarters, joint training facilities and store combat equipment, except nuclear arms. The Philippines could take over those buildings and facilities when the Americans leave. After the agreement was signed, the Americans launched construction projects in five Philippine camps and areas, including in the country\u2019s south, where U.S counterterrorism forces have helped train and provide intelligence to their Filipino counterparts for years. Many of the projects were delayed by legal issues and other problems, Philippine defense officials said. Large numbers of American forces stayed in local camps in southern Zamboanga city and outlying provinces at the height of threats posed by Muslim militants, which have eased in recent years. More than 100 U.S. military personnel currently remain in Zamboanga and three southern provinces, a Philippine military official told The Associated Press. A U.S. official told reporters that new areas have been identified to be developed to expand joint security cooperation and training. He did not provide details, including the type of military facilities, locations and the number of American military personnel to be deployed in those sites, saying the projects would have to be finalized with the Philippines. Philippine military chief of staff Lt. Gen. Bartolome Bacarro said last week that the U.S. wanted to construct military facilities in five more areas in the northern Philippines. Two of the new areas proposed by the Americans were in northern Cagayan province, Bacarro said. Cagayan is across a strait from Taiwan and could serve as a crucial outpost in case tensions worsen between China and the self-governed island that Beijing claims as its own.  The other proposed sites included the provinces of Palawan and Zambales, he said. They both face the South China Sea and would allow an American military presence nearer the disputed waters to support Filipino forces. The Philippine Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops in the country except when they are covered by treaties or agreements. Foreign forces are also banned from engaging in local combat.",

    "Biden at 80: A \u2018respecter of fate\u2019 mulls 2nd White House bid": [
        "By CALVIN WOODWARD, ZEKE MILLER and NATHAN ELLGRENNovember 19, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 People in their 80s lead countries, create majestic art and perform feats of endurance. One entered the record books for scaling Mount Everest. It\u2019s soon time for Joe Biden, 80 on Sunday, to decide whether he has one more mountain to climb \u2014 the one to a second term as president. Questions swirl now, in his own party as well as broadly in the country, about whether he\u2019s got what it takes to go for the summit again.  The oldest president in U.S. history, Biden hits his milestone birthday at a personal crossroads as he and his family face a decision in the coming months on whether he should announce for reelection. He\u2019d be 86 at the end of a potential second term.  Biden aides and allies all say he intends to run \u2014 and his team has begun quiet preparations for a campaign \u2014 but it has often been the president himself who has sounded the most equivocal. \u201cMy intention is that I run again,\u201d he said at a news conference this month. \u201dBut I\u2019m a great respecter of fate.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to have discussions about it,\u201d he said. Aides expect those conversations to pick up in earnest over Thanksgiving and Christmas, with a decision not until well after New Year\u2019s. Biden planned to celebrate his birthday at a family brunch in the White House on Sunday. To observe Biden at work is to see a leader tap a storehouse of knowledge built up over a half century in public office as he draws on deep personal relationships at home and abroad, his mastery of policy and his familiarity with how Washington works or doesn\u2019t. In short, the wisdom of the aged. \u201cThere is something to be said for experience,\u201d said Dartmouth College historian Matt Delmont as he noted the dozens of global leaders in their 80s. But to observe Biden is also to see him walk now often with a halting gait, in contrast to his trotting on stage on election night 2020.  It is to see him take a pass on a formal dinner with other world leaders without a real explanation, as happened on his trip abroad this past week, when he twice spoke of visiting Colombia when he meant Cambodia. Some supporters wince when he speaks, hoping he gets through his remarks OK. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s decision, at age 82, to pull back from leadership and let a new generation rise may spill over into Biden\u2019s thinking and that of his party as Democrats weigh whether they want to go with a proven winner or turn to the energy of youth. Among the questions Pelosi\u2019s move raises, said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, an authority on political communications at the University of Pennsylvania: \u201cEven if one is highly competent and successful, is there a point at which one should step aside to give others the opportunity to lead just as others stepped aside to make it possible for you to do so?  \u201cPelosi\u2019s decision makes such questions more salient in the context of Biden\u2019s 2020 statement that he was the bridge to a new generation of leaders.\u201d Biden\u2019s verbal flubs have been the stuff of legend throughout his five-decade political career, so sussing out the impact of age on his acuity is a guessing game for \u201carmchair gerontologists,\u201d as Dr. S. Jay Olshansky, an aging expert, puts it. In the distorted mirrors of social media commentary, every slip is magnified into supposed proof of senility. A moment of silent reflection by Biden in a meeting is presented as the president nodding off. All of that went into Donald Trump\u2019s quiver of falsehoods when he announced Tuesday he will seek the presidency again. Some allies see Biden\u2019s blunders as an increasing vulnerability in the eyes of voters as he\u2019s grown older. In an AP VoteCast survey of the electorate this month, fully 58% of voters said he does not have the mental capability to serve effectively as president. That was a grim picture of his standing now, not just looking ahead to another potential term. Only 34% said he\u2019s a strong leader. Those findings come alongside notably low approval ratings in league with Trump\u2019s at this point of their presidencies. Two months before the 2020 election, Olshansky, at the University of Illinois, Chicago, published a paper that predicted both Biden and Trump were bound to maintain their good health beyond the end of this presidential term. Based on a scientific team\u2019s evaluation of available medical records, family history and other information, the paper further concluded that both men are probably \u201csuper-agers,\u201d a subgroup of people who maintain their mental and physical functioning and tend to live longer than the average person their age. Nothing has changed Olshansky\u2019s mind about either of them. \u201cWhile President Biden may chronologically be 80 years old, biologically he probably isn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd biological age is far more important than chronological age.\u201d He calls Biden a \u201cclassic example of everything that\u2019s good about aging ... and so his age, I think, should be almost completely irrelevant.\u201d Biden is already in the club of high achievers for people his age. Unlike 92% of people 75 and over in the U.S., he still has a job, not to mention a mightily demanding one. And he\u2019s been on a roll. The November elections produced the best result for a Democratic president\u2019s party in midterms in decades \u2014 despite the poison pill of high inflation \u2014 as Democrats kept control of the Senate, narrowly lost the House in defiance of expectations of a rout, and won several competitive governors\u2019 races in key states. The president also sealed a string of consequential legislative victories in recent months, on climate, infrastructure, health care expansion, military aid to Ukraine and more. Biden says he begins most days with an 8 a.m. workout, when he is usually joined by his personal trainer and physical therapist, Drew Contreras, if he doesn\u2019t ride his Peloton bike. \u201cIf I let it go for a week, I feel it,\u201d he told the \u201cSmartless\u201d podcast recently. \u201cI used to be able to go for a week and nothing would change.\u201d White House aides say Biden reads his briefing book deep into the night, holds intensive evening meetings with advisers and has never balked at their scheduling requests that may have him out late, though rarely up early.  Yet his aides are deeply protective of the president, especially with his public schedule, which is lighter than those of Barack Obama and George W. Bush, both far younger in office. They\u2019ve shielded him from formal interviews and, until recently, press conferences.  To his doubters, he says: \u201cWatch me.\u201d Biden has been diagnosed with several very common age-related health conditions, none causing him serious problems. In his November 2021 summary of Biden\u2019s health after the president\u2019s first full physical in office, Dr. Kevin O\u2019Connor noted Biden\u2019s gait had become somewhat stiffer, something doctors watch for in older patients as it could signal a fall risk.  But after testing, the doctor concluded it\u2019s mostly due to ongoing \u201cwear and tear\u201d arthritis of the spine, as well as compensation for a broken foot sustained a year earlier and the development of \u201cmild peripheral neuropathy\u201d or subtle damage to some sensory nerves in the feet.  Experts say age is not destiny; what matters is good health, fitness and functioning. Japanese climber Yuichiro Miura had enough of those attributes to make it to the top of Mount Everest in 2013 at age 80, setting a record that an 85-year-old Nepali man died trying to break in 2017. Growing old is inexorable \u2014 at whatever pace, it comes.  It came at one pace for Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, for example, and it\u2019s coming at another for Pelosi, who is another institution in town. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d Marshall asked upon his decision to retire from the Supreme Court at age 82, before answering: \u201cI\u2019m old. I\u2019m getting old and coming apart.\u201d (He died two years later.) At the same age, Pelosi buzzes Capitol hallways in high heels, outpacing much younger people. And her cognitive abilities have never been in question.  The knock against her was that she blocked the highest ambitions of generations of younger lawmakers before her decision this past week not to seek reelection as House Democratic leader when Republicans take control. Supreme Court justices, shielded from the electorate and bosses, can grow as old in the job as they want and as fate allows \u2014 and they tend to stick around. Justice John Paul Stevens retired in 2010 at age 90, attributing his decision to a small stroke while reading his Citizens United dissent from the bench.  Ruth Bader Ginsberg, a hugely consequential 80-something, fell three years short of her goal to be as old as Stevens on the bench. She died in September 2020. In democracies, where voters are the boss, and in autocracies, where they\u2019re not, plenty of people in power soldier on in their advanced years, even if few are up there like former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who became the world\u2019s oldest leader at 92 and is running to get the office back, at 97.  Much of the leadership in the U.S. Congress is over 70, especially Democrats, and so were Biden\u2019s main rivals in the 2020 Democratic primaries and Trump. Attribute that, in part, to increasing longevity. \u201cLife expectancy back around 1900 in the United States was about 50,\u201d Olshansky said, \u201cand we added about 30 years\u201d since. In Cockeysville, Maryland, outside Baltimore, Nelson Hyman, 85, and his wife, Roz Hyman, 77, credit Biden with getting big things right and especially with appointing a strong team. To these Democrats, that adds up to an effective presidency that taps the value of age in a society that often doesn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt the president is as good as the people that he appoints, and I think he\u2019s appointed some very, very good people, very competent people, and he uses them,\u201d said Roz, a retired counselor in a psychiatric hospital. \u201cNow, are you going to ask me, is he going to be competent in two years? Who knows? I don\u2019t know.\u201d  A president can only be conceptual, said Nelson, retired from an insurance career, \u201cand the detail people will take care of the details.\u201d When Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, he said, Biden stepped up, \u201dspoke beautifully and strongly\u201d and \u201chas not been afraid to deal with Putin. Not at all.\u201d They recalled seeing Ronald Reagan struggle in his second term, before he was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s after he left office, and felt that he, too, had surrounded himself with competence, as much as they disagreed with his direction. Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center, said Reagan posted major achievements even when his memory may have been slipping, in part because his aides were strong and accomplished and Reagan retained the values that informed his judgments. That\u2019s true of many presidents, Biden included, she said. Trump, in contrast, preferred a team largely of acolytes. But when a perception does take hold in the public, any slipup can feed it, whether it is relevant or not. When Biden tumbled on his bicycle in Delaware in June, his foot or feet caught in the pedals\u2019 cages, the mishap fed the perception of a president not at the top of his game physically. \u201cThose of us that know a little about aging were pretty impressed by the fact that he was on his bicycle to begin with ... that you\u2019ve got somebody who is really active and healthy for his age,\u201d said Olshansky. Instead, the focus was on his injury-free fall. Ageism pops up in campaigns even when opposing candidates are both old themselves; witness Trump\u2019s references to \u201cSleepy Joe\u201d in 2020 and Biden\u2019s characterization of Trump as \u201cmentally deranged.\u201d But it was particularly pronounced in the 2008 presidential contest between Obama, 47 in that fall\u2019s campaign, and Sen. John McCain, then 72. When Obama misidentified the city he was in, the flub was attributed to a long day by a nation-trotting barnstormer, Jamieson said. When McCain did that, it was his age. The Obama campaign exploited the age gap in what Jamieson said were underhanded ways. She noticed and, with her technical team, confirmed that in at least two ads, recordings of McCain had been slowed down to make him sound mentally feeble. But the sharpest cracks about age came from McCain himself. \u201cGood evening, my fellow Americans,\u201d he said on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d \u201cI ask you, what should we be looking for in our next president? Certainly someone who is very, very, very old.\u201d ___ Associated Press writers Mark Sherman and Lauran Neergaard contributed to this report.",

    "Justices asked to hear dog toy dispute. Will they bite?": [
        "By JESSICA GRESKONovember 20, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The company that makes Jack Daniel\u2019s is howling mad over a squeaking dog toy that parodies the whiskey\u2019s signature bottle. Now, the liquor company is barking at the door of the Supreme Court. Jack Daniel\u2019s has asked the justices to hear its case against the manufacturer of the plastic Bad Spaniels toy. The high court could say as soon as Monday whether the justices will agree. A number of major companies from the makers of Campbell Soup to outdoor brand Patagonia and jeans maker Levi Strauss have urged the justices to take what they say is an important case for trademark law. The toy that has Jack Daniel\u2019s so doggone mad mimics the square shape of its whisky bottle as well as its black-and-white label and amber-colored liquor while adding what it calls \u201cpoop humor.\u201d While the original bottle has the words \u201cOld No. 7 brand\u201d and \u201cTennessee Sour Mash Whiskey,\u201d the parody proclaims: \u201cThe Old No. 2 on Your Tennessee Carpet.\u201d Instead of the original\u2019s note that it is 40% alcohol by volume, the parody says it\u2019s \u201c43% Poo by Vol.\u201d and \u201c100% Smelly.\u201d The toy retails for about $13 to $20 and the packaging notes in small font: \u201cThis product is not affiliated with Jack Daniel Distillery.\u201d The toy\u2019s maker says Jack Daniel\u2019s can\u2019t take a joke. \u201cIt is ironic that America\u2019s leading distiller of whiskey both lacks a sense of humor and does not recognize when it \u2014 and everyone else \u2014 has had enough,\u201d lawyers for Arizona-based VIP Products wrote the high court. They told the justices that Jack Daniel\u2019s has \u201cwaged war\u201d against the company for \u201chaving the temerity to produce a pun-filled parody\u201d of its bottle. But Jack Daniel\u2019s lead attorney, Lisa Blatt, made no bones about the company\u2019s position in her filing. \u201cTo be sure, everyone likes a good joke. But VIP\u2019s profit-motivated \u2018joke\u2019 confuses consumers by taking advantage of Jack Daniel\u2019s hard-earned goodwill,\u201d she wrote for the Louisville, Kentucky-based Brown-Forman Corp., Jack Daniel\u2019s parent company. Blatt wrote that a lower court decision provides \u201cnear-blanket protection\u201d to humorous trademark infringement. And she said it has \u201cbroad and dangerous consequences,\u201d pointing to children who were hospitalized after eating marijuana-infused products that mimicked candy packaging. If VIP Products is allowed to confuse consumers with dog toys, \u201cother funny infringers can do the same with juice boxes or marijuana-infused candy,\u201d Blatt wrote.  The toy is part of a line of VIP Products called Silly Squeakers that mimic liquor, beer, wine and soda bottles. They include Mountain Drool, which parodies Mountain Dew, and Heini Sniff\u2019n, which parodies Heineken. A court in 2008 barred the company from selling its Budweiser parody, ButtWiper. After the company began selling its Bad Spaniels toy in 2014, Jack Daniel\u2019s told the company to stop, but VIP went to court to be allowed to continue to sell its product. Jack Daniel\u2019s won the first round in court but lost an appeal. The case reached the Supreme Court at an earlier stage, but the justices didn\u2019t bite. Bad Spaniels isn\u2019t the only parody puppy toy to draw the ire of the brand it imitated. Luxury bag maker Louis Vuitton sued the makers of Chewy Vuiton over their plush purse dog toys. In 2007 a federal appeals court sided with the chew toy\u2019s manufacturers, Nevada-based Haute Diggity Dog. Louis Vuitton didn\u2019t appeal to the Supreme Court. The case is Jack Daniel\u2019s Properties Inc. v. VIP Products LLC, 22-148.",

    "Aid sought for Moldova, hit hard by war in next-door Ukraine": [
        "By ANGELA CHARLTON and STEPHEN McGRATHNovember 21, 2022 GMT",
        " PARIS (AP) \u2014 Diplomats are drumming up money and other support Monday for Europe\u2019s poorest country, Moldova, which is suffering massive blackouts, heavy refugee flows and potential security threats from the war in neighboring Ukraine. Monday\u2019s international aid conference in Paris is aimed at \u201cconcrete and immediate assistance\u201d for the land-locked former Soviet republic, according to the French Foreign Ministry. Two previous conferences for Moldova this year raised hundreds of millions of euros, but as the war drags on, its needs are growing. \u201cThis international support is all the more important as Moldova is currently facing an unprecedented energy crisis which, with the approach of winter, poses a risk of a humanitarian crisis for the Moldovan population,\u201d the ministry said. Broad blackouts temporarily hit more than a half-dozen Moldovan cities last week as the Russian military pounded infrastructure targets across Ukraine. Moldova\u2019s Soviet-era energy systems remain interconnected Ukraine, which is why the Russian missile barrage triggered the automatic shutdown of a supply line. Nicu Popescu, Moldova\u2019s foreign minister and minister for European integration, said at the Paris conference Monday that \u201cthe objective of today is to continue moving forward with ensuring peace, stability in our part of Europe.\u201d  \u201cUkraine is facing this brutal Russian aggression but this aggression is posing a problem for everyone in Europe and that of course applies (to) Moldova,\u201d he said. \u201cMoldova is severely affected by this war economically, when it comes to the security of energy supplies.\u201d Earlier this month, the European Union pledged 250 million euros (nearly $260 million) to help Moldova after Russia halved its natural gas supply. Moldova\u2019s energy crisis worsened when Transnistria \u2014 a Moscow-backed separatist region of Moldova with a key power plant \u2014 also cut electricity to other parts of the country.  Sharply rising energy costs and skyrocketing inflation are set to put a huge strain on consumers in the country of about 2.6 million people as the cold season begins to grip. Moldova relied heavily on Russian energy before the war, and has increasingly been looking to forge closer ties with the West. It became a candidate for EU membership in June, along with Ukraine. However, its joining the 27-nation bloc is contingent on a series of key reforms such as cleaning up corruption and the rule of law and full membership will take many years.  \u201cWe\u2019ve had rockets, Russian missiles crossing our airspace,\u201d Moldova\u2019s Popescu said. \u201cWe face multiple challenges so we are here to work with our European partners to alleviate the impact of this war on Moldova, to maintain peace and stability.\u201d Since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, Moldova has been rocked by a series of worrisome events \u2014 with many fearing that the war could spill across its border. In July and August, scores of false bomb threats were reported in the country; missile debris landed last month in a Moldovan border village; in April, tensions in Transnistria soared after a series of explosions hit the breakaway region. Moldova\u2019s pro-Western president, Maia Sandu, is meeting French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday. ___ Stephen McGrath reported from Sighisoara, Romania. ___ Follow the AP\u2019s coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "VP Harris to visit front-line Philippine island in sea feud": [
        "By JIM GOMEZNovember 20, 2022 GMT",
        " MANILA, Philippines (AP) \u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris will underscore America\u2019s commitment to defending treaty ally the Philippines with a visit that started Sunday and involves flying to an island province facing the disputed South China Sea, where Washington has accused China of bullying smaller claimant nations. After attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Thailand, Harris flew Sunday night to a red-carpet welcome in Manila. On Monday, she meets President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. for talks aimed at reinforcing Washington\u2019s oldest treaty alliance in Asia and strengthening economic ties, said a senior U.S. administration official, who was not identified according to practice, in an online briefing ahead of the visit. Harris said her trip to Thailand was \u201cquite successful\u201d as she reiterated the U.S. commitment to the region Sunday afternoon at a roundtable discussion on climate change.  The panel of climate activists, civil society members and business leaders focused on clean energy and the threat climate change is posing to the Mekong River, which more than 60 million people in Southeast Asia use for food, water and transport. Harris announced the U.S. plans to provide up to $20 million in funding for clean energy in the region via the Japan-U.S. Mekong Power Partnership. Before her flight out, she stopped by a local market and perused a maze of shops, struck up conversations with shopkeepers and purchased Thai green curry paste. On Tuesday she\u2019ll fly to Palawan province, which lies along the South China Sea, to meet fishermen, villagers, officials and the coast guard. Once there, she\u2019ll be the highest-ranking U.S. leader to visit the frontier island at the forefront of the long-seething territorial disputes involving China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan. The Philippine coast guard is scheduled to welcome Harris on board one of its biggest patrol ships, the BRP Teresa Magbanua, in Palawan, where she is scheduled to deliver a speech, according to coast guard spokesperson Commodore Armand Balilo. Harris will underscore the importance of international law, unimpeded commerce and freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, the U.S. official said.  China can view the visit the way it wants, the official added in response to a question, but Washington\u2019s message is that the U.S., as a member of the Indo-Pacific, is engaged and committed to the security of its allies in the region. Philippine Ambassador to Washington Jose Manuel Romualdez said Harris\u2019s trip to Palawan shows the level of America\u2019s support to an ally and concern over China\u2019s actions in the disputed sea. \u201cThat\u2019s as obvious as you can get, that the message they\u2019re trying to impart to the Chinese is that \u2018we support our allies like the Philippines on these disputed islands,\u2019\u201d Romualdez told The Associated Press. \u201cThis visit is a significant step in showing how serious the United States views this situation now.\u201d Washington and Beijing have long been on a collision course in the contested waters. While the U.S. lays no claims to the strategic waterway, where an estimated $5 trillion in global trade transits each year, it has said that freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea is in America\u2019s national interest. China opposes U.S. Navy and Air Force patrols in the busy waterway, which Beijing claims virtually in its entirety. It has warned Washington not to meddle in what it says is a purely Asian territorial conflict \u2014 which has become a delicate front-line in the U.S.-China rivalry in the region and has long been feared as a potential flashpoint. In July, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called on China to comply with a 2016 arbitration ruling that invalidated Beijing\u2019s vast territorial claims in the South China Sea and warned that Washington is obligated to defend treaty ally Philippines if its forces, vessels or aircraft come under attack in the disputed waters. China has rejected the 2016 decision by an arbitration tribunal set up in The Hague under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea after the Philippine government complained in 2013 about China\u2019s increasingly aggressive actions in the disputed waters. Beijing did not participate in the arbitration, rejected its ruling as a sham and continues to defy it. Harris\u2019 visit is the latest sign of the growing rapport between Washington and Manila under Marcos Jr., who took office in June after a landslide electoral victory.  America\u2019s relations with the Philippines entered a difficult period under Marcos\u2019 predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, who threatened to sever ties with Washington and expel visiting American forces, and once attempted to abrogate a major defense pact with the U.S. while nurturing cozy ties with China and Russia. When President Joe Biden met Marcos Jr. for the first time in September in New York on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, he stressed the depth by which the U.S. regards its relations with the Philippines despite some headwinds.  \u201cWe\u2019ve had some rocky times, but the fact is it\u2019s a critical, critical relationship, from our perspective. I hope you feel the same way,\u201d Biden said then. Marcos Jr. told him, \u201cWe are your partners. We are your allies. We are your friends.\u201d The rapprochement came at a crucial time when the U.S. needed to build a deterrent presence amid growing security threats in the region, Romualdez said. Philippine military chief of staff Lt. Gen. Bartolome Bacarro said last week that the U.S. wanted to construct military facilities in five more areas in the northern Philippines under a 2014 defense cooperation pact, which allows American forces to build warehouses and temporary living quarters within Philippine military camps.  The Philippines Constitution prohibits foreign military bases but at least two defense pacts allow temporary visits by American forces with their aircraft and Navy ships for joint military exercises, combat training and bracing to respond to natural disasters. The northern Philippines is strategically located across a strait from Taiwan and could serve as a crucial outpost in case tensions worsen between China and the self-governed island.  Harris spoke briefly with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Saturday while heading into a closed-door meeting at APEC. When asked Sunday whether they discussed Taiwan or North Korea, she reiterated they talked about \u201ckeeping open lines of communication.\u201d While aiming to deepen ties, the Biden administration has to contend with concerns by human rights groups over Marcos Jr. The Philippine leader has steadfastly defended the legacy of his father, a dictator who was ousted in a 1986 pro-democracy uprising amid human rights atrocities and plunder. Harris also plans to meet Vice President Sara Duterte, daughter of Marcos\u2019 predecessor, who oversaw a deadly anti-drugs crackdown that left thousands of mostly poor suspects dead and sparked an International Criminal Court investigation as a possible crime against humanity. The vice president has defended her father\u2019s presidency. Given the Biden administration\u2019s high-profile advocacy for democracy and human rights, its officials have said human rights were at the top of the agenda in each of their engagements with Marcos Jr. and his officials. After her meeting Monday with Marcos Jr., Harris plans to meet civil society activists to demonstrate U.S. commitment and continued support for human rights and democratic resilience, the U.S. official said. ___ Associated Press writer Krutika Pathi in Bangkok contributed to this report.",

        "November 20, 2022 GMT",
        " LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Democratic U.S. Rep. Jimmy Gomez defeated rival Democrat David Kim on Saturday in a Los Angeles district after a battle on the party\u2019s progressive flank. With nearly all the ballots counted, Gomez had 51.3% to 48.7% for Kim, or a margin of about 3,000 votes. The race was a rematch from 2020 when Gomez defeated Kim, an immigration lawyer. Under California\u2019s primary rules, only the top two finishers advance to the November election, which set up the fight between two Democrats. The heavily Democratic 34th District is a diverse, urban mishmash of neighborhoods that cuts across income, racial and ethnic groups. It includes downtown Los Angeles, Koreatown and heavily Latino Boyle Heights.  Fewer than 1 in 10 voters in the district are Republicans, over 60% are Democrats and most of the remainder are independents who lean Democratic. Earlier this week, Republicans regained overall control of the House by reaching the 218 seat threshold for a majority. The outcome in the Los Angeles district doesn\u2019t sway the balance of control since both candidates were Democrats.  Counting is not yet finished in a handful of other undecided races.  Gomez\u2019s campaign touted him as \u201cthe proven progressive who delivers for us,\u201d and his website includes photographs of him with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. It spotlights that he supports Medicare-for-all and Green New Deal climate change proposals. Kim supported so-called universal basic income checks of $1,000 a month for every adult, Medicare-for-all and building 12 million publicly funded housing units over 10 years. ",

    "Biden\u2019s granddaughter Naomi, Peter Neal wed at White House": [
        "By DARLENE SUPERVILLENovember 19, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Trailed by a lengthy, flowing veil, President Joe Biden\u2019s granddaughter Naomi Biden walked across the South Lawn of the White House on Saturday toward an altar of shrubs and flowers to marry her longtime boyfriend Peter Neal in a rare wedding on the grounds.  Theirs was just the 19th wedding in 200-plus years of White House history.  Under a sunny, blue sky paired with unseasonably crisp 40-degree temperatures, the bride and groom, both dressed by American fashion designer Ralph Lauren, exchanged \u201cI do\u2019s\u201d as 250 family members and friends watched as they were united in a nearly hourlong ceremony.  Naomi Biden, 28, wore a long-sleeved, high-neck gown and veil covering hair that had been styled behind her head. Neal, 25, chose a navy blue, three-piece suit with a double-breasted vest.  President Biden and first lady Jill Biden hosted the wedding of their eldest grandchild.  \u201cIt has been a joy to watch Naomi grow, discover who she is, and carve out such an incredible life for herself,\u201d they said in a statement announcing the marriage of Naomi King Biden and Peter George Heermann Neal.  \u201cNow, we are filled with pride to see her choose Peter as her husband and we are honored to welcome him to our family,\u201d they said. \u201cWe wish them days full of laughter and a love that grows deeper with every passing year.\u201d  The south side of the White House, facing the lawn and Washington Monument, was decorated with wreaths and garland bearing white flowers. The bride walked down an aisle that led from the Diplomatic Reception Room to the altar of shrubs and white flowers.  Guests began arriving at the security checkpoint hours before the ceremony, including women in open-toed shoes despite the chill. Some guests were given hand warmers. Most wore coats, and some topped off with hats and scarves. It is the first White House wedding with a president\u2019s granddaughter as the bride, and the first one ever on the South Lawn.  Pennsylvania Avenue was closed to ordinary pedestrians before and during the ceremony, as was a sidewalk bordering the Ellipse, the park just south of the White House.  After the ceremony, the newlyweds, their families and the wedding party had lunch in the White House. A reception with dessert and dancing was planned for later Saturday. President Biden went to church in Washington in between events.  Unlike some past White House weddings, Naomi Biden and Neal barred journalists, although the ceremony was outdoors on the grounds of what the president and first lady call the \u201cpeople\u2019s house.\u201d The White House released a photo, and others were posted on the wedding planner\u2019s social media account. Naomi Biden is a lawyer in Washington. She is the daughter of Hunter Biden and his first wife, Kathleen Buhle. Neal, of Jackson Hole, Wyoming, recently graduated from the University of Pennsylvania law school. He works at Georgetown University Law Center in Washington. His parents are Drs. Mary C. and William \u201cBill\u201d C. Neal of Jackson Hole.  The couple, who have been living at the White House, was set up by a mutual friend about four years ago in New York City and have been together ever since, the White House said. Neal proposed in September 2021 near his childhood home in Jackson Hole with a ring that repurposed the band of his grandmother\u2019s engagement ring, according to the White House. The White House has released few other details about the wedding, citing the couple\u2019s desire for privacy. The Biden family will pay for all wedding activities, officials have said. \u201cNaomi and Peter have asked that their wedding be closed to the media and we are respecting their wishes,\u201d White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Friday. White House weddings are rare. There have been 18 documented weddings in the 200-plus-year history of the White House. Nine involved a president\u2019s daughter, most recently Richard Nixon\u2019s daughter Tricia in 1971 and Lyndon Johnson\u2019s daughter Lynda in 1967.  But nieces, a grandniece, a son and first ladies\u2019 siblings have also gotten married there. One president, Grover Cleveland, tied the knot at the White House, too, while in office. Some of the weddings were open to coverage by the news media, while others weren\u2019t at all. Journalists were allowed into Tricia Nixon\u2019s wedding to Ed Cox, the first wedding held in the Rose Garden. Her wedding planner \u2014 a three-ring black binder in the offices of the White House Historical Association \u2014 includes extensive notes on the media plan. But the May 1994 wedding of a brother of then-first lady Hillary Clinton and the daughter of then-U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer \u2014 the first since Tricia Nixon\u2019s marriage \u2014 was closed to the press. Clinton\u2019s spokesperson commented afterward and the White House released a photo. It was the same for the October 2013 wedding of Pete Souza, President Barack Obama\u2019s official photographer, and his longtime partner, Patti Lease. The White House announced the wedding in a statement following the small, private wedding in the Rose Garden.  The White House Correspondents Association, which advocates for press access to the White House and the president, said it was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d that the White House declined its request for press coverage of Naomi Biden\u2019s wedding. \u201cWhite House weddings have been covered by the press throughout history and the first family\u2019s wish for privacy must be balanced against the public\u2019s interest in an event occurring at the People\u2019s House with the president as a participant,\u201d the WHCA board said in a statement. Stewart McLaurin, president of the White House Historical Association, said it\u2019s important to remember that first families are families first. \u201cTheir privacy should be respected, their wishes should be respected,\u201d he said.",

    "Walker, Kemp campaign in Ga. together for the 1st time": [
        "By BILL BARROWNovember 19, 2022 GMT",
        " SMYRNA, Ga. (AP) \u2014 Fresh off his commanding reelection, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp on Saturday played the role of dutiful Republican soldier as he campaigned for the first time alongside Senate hopeful Herschel Walker after spending months steering clear of his ticket-mate. The joint appearance reflects how important Kemp\u2019s broad coalition will be in determining whether Walker can unseat Sen. Raphael Warnock in a Dec. 6 runoff. The fact it occurred only now underscores the challenges that Walker, a celebrity athlete turned politician, has had appealing to many independents and moderate Republicans amid an intense focus on his rocky past. \u201cWe cannot rest on our laurels, everyone,\u201d Kemp told a few hundred supporters standing in the parking lot of a gun store in suburban Atlanta, urging them to cast one more ballot in a midterm election year that was underwhelming for Republicans nationally. Kemp was the top vote-getter in Georgia\u2019s general election, drawing 200,000 more votes in his matchup with Democratic challenger Stacey Abrams than Walker did in his challenge to Warnock. The result: Kemp defeated Abrams by 7.5 percentage points, while Walker trailed Warnock by about 36,000 votes or almost 1 percentage point. Warnock fell just shy of a majority, however, triggering the four-week runoff blitz. The governor campaigned throughout the fall mostly for his own reelection, though he made appearances with several GOP nominees for lower statewide offices. All of them won without runoffs. The notable absence was always Walker, with Kemp sometimes avoiding even saying his name when reporters asked about the distance between the two campaigns. Kemp would often say only that he backed the \u201centire ticket.\u201d Since securing a second term, Kemp has become more explicit in his support, even if still calculated. He\u2019s signed over his voter turnout operation to a Republican political action committee aligned with Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell and endorsed Walker anew in recent interviews. On Saturday, he pitched Walker as a fiscal and cultural conservative who would back tax cuts and support law enforcement and the military, and he repeated Republicans\u2019 principal attack on Warnock: That he votes with President Joe Biden \u201c96% of the time.\u201d \u201cI know that Herschel Walker will fight for us,\u201d Kemp said. \u201cHe will go and fight for those values that we believe in here in our state.\u201d Yet Kemp also used his brief time on stage as a personal victory lap, nodding to his coming second term and mentioning Abrams before he said anything about Walker or Warnock. \u201cI\u2019ve never been more optimistic about the future of our state, and we\u2019re going to keep our state moving in the right direction because we stopped Stacey and saved Georgia,\u201d he said. Republicans see Kemp as a critical validator for Walker, especially since the Georgia runoff is now more locally focused because Democrats already have secured 50 seats and hold Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019s tie-breaking vote.  For much of the year, Walker and Republicans tried to nationalize the race because it was among the battlegrounds that would determine Senate control, as Georgia did two years ago with concurrent Senate runoffs won by Democrats Warnock and Sen. Jon Ossoff. The strategy was partly about tying Warnock to Biden because of the president\u2019s lagging approval ratings and generationally high inflation. But it was also seen as a necessity because of some of Walker\u2019s liabilities. Walker has on multiple occasions exaggerated his academic achievements, business success and philanthropic activities. He\u2019s faced accusations of violence against his first wife. During the campaign, he acknowledged multiple children he\u2019d not previously talked about publicly, doing so only after media reports on their existence. In October, two women Walker once dated alleged that he encouraged and paid for their abortions despite his stance as a candidate for a national abortion ban with no exceptions. Walker denies he ever paid for an abortion and has answered with a withering assault on Warnock, focusing in recent weeks on the poor living conditions at an Atlanta apartment building owned by a foundation of the Ebenezer Baptist Church where Warnock serves as senior pastor. Walker has used apparent eviction notices issued to some tenants and complaints by its residents to cast Warnock as a \u201chypocrite\u201d and \u201cwolf in sheep\u2019s clothing.\u201d  Still, the cumulative effect has fed Warnock\u2019s efforts to tag Walker as \u201cnot ready\u201d and \u201cnot fit\u201d for the Senate, and it\u2019s made Walker much less popular than Kemp, especially among independents and moderate Republicans. That\u2019s more concerning in an environment where the GOP can\u2019t use Senate control as the incentive for wary GOP-leaning voters to back Walker. Walker\u2019s electoral shortcomings were especially acute in suburban Atlanta. While Walker ran about 5 points behind Kemp statewide, that gap was almost 7 points in Cobb County, where Saturday\u2019s rally was held, with similar gaps in several other metro area counties that are critical to Republicans\u2019 statewide coalition. Indeed, an AP VoteCast survey of the general electorate found that 7 in 10 voters who backed Kemp said they did so enthusiastically, but only about half of Walker\u2019s voters said the same. Among Walker supporters, about 4 in 10 said they backed him with reservations and about 1 in 10 said they were opposing the other candidates. Further, Kemp seems to have reaped benefits from having resisted former President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia and nationally. Only 29% of Georgia\u2019s voters said Kemp supports former President Trump too much, according to AP VoteCast, while 43% said that of Walker, who is a friend of Trump and is running with his endorsement. \u201cBrian Kemp is clearly the most popular Republican in Georgia, and he clearly has the most significant organization,\u201d said Josh Holmes, an influential Republican strategist in Washington and former chief of staff to McConnell. Even Democrats concede the point, holding a press conference earlier Saturday featuring voters who said they voted for Kemp and Warnock.  \u2014 Associated Press reporter Hannah Fingerhut contributed from Washington.

    "New special counsel has long career confronting corruption": [
        "By ERIC TUCKERNovember 19, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The year was 2010 and the Justice Department\u2019s prestigious public integrity section was still recovering from a costly debacle over the withholding of exculpatory evidence in a case against Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens. The crisis had caused then-Attorney General Eric Holder, in a remarkable move, to ask a judge to throw out all convictions against the Republican lawmaker. In search of a new leader for the unit, the Justice Department turned to a war crimes prosecutor in The Hague who\u2019d cut his teeth in New York prosecuting state and federal crimes, including the brutal beating of a Haitian immigrant by police. Jack Smith told The Associated Press in an interview that year that he\u2019d read about the Stevens case and couldn\u2019t resist the chance to step in and run the section. \u201cI had a dream job and I had no desire to leave it, but opportunities like this don\u2019t come up very often,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI left the dream job for a better one.\u201d Now, Smith has a new position that, if not necessarily a dream job, nonetheless places him at the center of two of the most significant Justice Department investigations in years. As a newly named special counsel, Smith will be tasked with overseeing probes into the retention of classified documents at former President Donald Trump\u2019s Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, as well as aspects of an investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election won by Democrat Joe Biden. The investigations carry obvious political implications because they concern a former president and current White House hopeful \u2014 indeed, Attorney General Merrick Garland cited Trump\u2019s entry into the race this week, along with Biden\u2019s stated intention to run again, as reasons he acted now in appointing Smith on Friday. Smith will presumably have to move swiftly to ensure his work concludes before the home stretch of the 2024 presidential election, given the Justice Department\u2019s historic interest in avoiding action that could be seen as interfering in the outcome of a race. Colleagues who have worked with Smith describe him as hard-charging, fast-working and passionate, a prosecutor who operates free of political persuasion and who is relentless about his cases. He displays a similar style outside court, where he is a competitive athlete who has participated in triathlons all over the world. \u201cHe\u2019s an exquisite lawyer and an exquisite prosecutor,\u201d said Lanny Breuer, who led the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division, which includes the public integrity section, at the time Smith was hired for the job. \u201cHe\u2019s not political at all. He\u2019s straight down the middle.\u201d The Harvard-educated Smith spent his formative years in New York, where his cases included the prosecution of police officers involved in the broomstick sodomy of Haitian immigrant Abner Louima. While in New York, he once spent a weekend sleeping in the hallway of an apartment building so he could intercept a victim who was afraid to testify in a domestic violence case. The woman wound up taking the stand after what Smith said was a \u201clong, long talk.\u201d After a stint as a war crimes prosecutor, he rejoined the Justice Department to lead the public integrity section. During his tenure, the section pressed ahead with significant, but challenging, prosecutions against prominent public figures from both political parties. Prosecutors scored a public corruption conviction against former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican, but the case was later overturned by the Supreme Court. The section also prosecuted former Democratic vice presidential nominee John Edwards, but a jury acquitted him on one count and deadlocked on others and the Justice Department declined to try him again. Although those two cases ultimately came up short, the section brought successful cases against a number of state officials charged with defrauding taxpayers as well as service members who defrauded the military. There were high-profile victories for the section, too.  Smith, for instance, led the unit when Arizona congressman Rick Renzi was convicted of corruption, a verdict that was left in place by the Supreme Court \u2014 though Trump pardoned the Republican before he left office. Former New York state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver was indicted in 2015 on corruption charges, and was later sent to prison. As chief, he also showed a willingness to walk away from cases when the evidence was insufficient, closing out some long-running investigations into political figures without charges. He told the AP in the same 2010 interview that \u201cyou have to be able to admit that if it\u2019s not there, it\u2019s not there.\u201d In 2015, Smith became a federal prosecutor in Nashville and later served as acting chief of that office before heading to private practice and, more recently, as chief prosecutor for the special court in The Hague tasked with investigating war crimes in Kosovo. Alan Tieger, a fellow war crimes prosecutor who has worked with Smith, described him as \u201cboth a guy imbued with old-fashioned ideals but who\u2019s relentless and driven and brilliant.\u201d He said Smith \u201cbrings that entire skill set to bear.\u201d \u201cYou never see Jack dragging through a day,\u201d Tieger said. \u201cHe\u2019s full-on every day.\u201d Yet even in a career of high-profile cases, the Trump investigations are likely to be closely watched, his actions dissected by the public not just through a legal lens but also for their political impact.  He will be responsible for assessing whether Trump or anyone else should be prosecuted. His decisions are to be given such great deference that, under the regulations, should the Justice Department reject any major investigative step or move that Smith wants to take, it would have to notify Congress at the end of the investigation. In a statement Friday, Smith pledged to conduct the investigations \u201cindependently and in the best traditions of the Department of Justice.\u201d \u201cThe pace of the investigations will not pause or flag under my watch,\u201d he said. \u201cI will exercise independent judgement and will move the investigations forward expeditiously and thoroughly to whatever outcome the facts and the law dictate.\u201d _____ Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP",

    "NC Democrats\u2019 parity in Congress delegation may be fleeting": [
        "By GARY D. ROBERTSON and HANNAH SCHOENBAUMNovember 19, 2022 GMT",
        " RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Democrats celebrated winning what was billed as North Carolina\u2019s lone toss-up race for the U.S. House this month, as state Sen. Wiley Nickel\u2019s narrow victory over Republican Bo Hines in the 13th Congressional District helped weaken any national GOP midterm wave. Nickel\u2019s win creates a 7-7 split in the state\u2019s delegation, marking the best showing for state Democrats after a decade of trailing the GOP in an otherwise closely divided state. Trial judges drew the latest district boundaries after redistricting litigation successfully blocked maps passed by the Republican-controlled legislature that could have whittled Democrats down to four seats.  \u201cWe\u2019re a 50-50 state \u2014 we should have a 7-to-7 delegation,\u201d Nickel told The Associated Press this week during a break in his congressional orientation in Washington. \u201cWhen we have fair maps, we get fair results that reflect the choice of the voters.\u201d But there\u2019s a good chance Nickel\u2019s Raleigh-area district and others will be dramatically altered for the 2024 elections, returning the advantage to Republicans. A confluence of events opens the door for General Assembly Republicans to pass their preferred congressional map in 2023 and have it used the following year. A new GOP majority on the state Supreme Court likely will be more skeptical of legal challenges that allege excessive partisanship. \u201cSeven-seven does not reflect the will of the voters in North Carolina,\u201d House Speaker Tim Moore told reporters the day after the election. \u201cSo it should be something different. I don\u2019t know what that is. But at the end of the day ... let\u2019s trust the voters of this state.\u201d Republicans hold eight of the state\u2019s 13 U.S. House districts through the year\u2019s end. Population growth gave North Carolina a 14th seat with the November election.  GOP legislators vehemently opposed a split opinion by the state Supreme Court last winter that struck down a more favorable map for their party by declaring the state constitution prohibited partisan gerrymandering of boundaries.  State law required the judge-drawn map be used only for this year\u2019s races. Republicans will continue to have majorities in the state House and Senate next year comfortable enough to pass their favored map. Redistricting plans are not subject to Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper\u2019s veto stamp.  Most importantly, Republicans will have a 5-2 majority on the Supreme Court come January with victories by Trey Allen and Richard Dietz for seats currently held by registered Democrats.  The current 4-3 Democratic majority ruled that congressional and legislative maps approved by the General Assembly in November 2021 unlawfully gave Republicans outsized favoritism compared with Democrats. The three Republican justices who dissented wrote that the constitution doesn\u2019t expressly bar or limit partisan advantage in mapmaking. The arrival of two more GOP justices makes it more likely \u2014 but not assured \u2014 that the court would uphold a future congressional map by the legislature while rejecting last year\u2019s landmark ruling that defined illegal partisan gerrymandering. Senate leader Phil Berger said he expected the state would now move away from what he called the \u201cjudicial gerrymander\u201d to \u201cwhat would be, I think, a different drawing of the congressional maps.\u201d  It\u2019s too soon to say what the next congressional lines will look like. Plans approved by the legislature but never implemented would have positioned Republicans to win 10 of the state\u2019s 14 congressional seats.  Michael Bitzer, a political science professor at Catawba College in Salisbury, said Nickel would be a likely target for Republican lawmakers to place in a more GOP-friendly district.  Democratic state Sen. Jeff Jackson, who won the newly created 14th District seat covering portions of Mecklenburg and Gaston counties, and 6th District Democratic Rep. Kathy Manning of Greensboro, who won her third term, are also vulnerable, Bitzer said.  It\u2019s possible the state Supreme Court shift could be moot. Litigation involving the congressional map is before the U.S. Supreme Court and could result in state courts losing the ability to judge laws involving federal elections, including seat boundaries. Oral arguments are scheduled for next month in the case, in which lawyers for Berger and Moore argue the U.S. Constitution delegates \u201cthe Times, Places and Manner\u201d of congressional elections solely to state legislatures. \u201cEven if they\u2019re unsuccessful in the U.S. Supreme Court, they now have a state Supreme Court that is most likely to be deferential to whatever the legislature comes up with, excusing any precedent\u201d reached by the state justices, Bitzer said. An analysis by Bitzer of federal statewide contests in North Carolina since 2008 show Republican candidates winning nearly 51% of the cumulative votes compared with 47% for Democrats. But the idea that a political party should be assured of seats aligned with their percentage support at the ballot box over time was shunned by authors of the state Supreme Court\u2019s prevailing and dissenting opinions last February. Nickel said he\u2019s not worrying himself about what a future map looks like. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a huge opportunity to make some real bipartisan accomplishments in the next Congress, so that\u2019s really the focus,\u201d Nickel said. \u201cAt some point, they will draw new maps, but I\u2019m optimistic that when that happens, we\u2019ll have a seat we can run in.\u201d ___ Schoenbaum is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

    "Officials: Georgia audit confirms secretary of state winner": [
        "By SUDHIN THANAWALANovember 19, 2022 GMT",
        " ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 A hand count of random batches of votes in Georgia\u2019s recent election for secretary of state has confirmed Republican Brad Raffensperger\u2019s victory, state election officials said. The audit \u2014 required by state law \u2014 turned up a small difference in votes from the machine count used during the election, but the difference was well within the expected margin of error, the Secretary of State\u2019s office announced Friday. \u201cThis audit shows that our system works and that our county election officials conducted a secure, accurate election,\u201d Raffensperger said in a statement.  The audit follows a law passed in 2019, not from any concerns about the integrity of the state\u2019s election results. An audit is required for general elections in even-numbered years on a race selected by the secretary of state. It must be completed before the election results are certified. Raffensperger announced earlier this month that he was choosing his race for the audit because it had the widest margin of victory, which would make the audit easier for counties to carry out. Raffensperger beat Democratic state House Rep. Bee Nguyen by more than 9 percent.  In risk-limiting audits, the smaller the margin between candidates in a race, the larger the sample of ballots that must initially be audited.  In 2020, he chose the presidential contest in Georgia between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden for the risk-limiting audit. Biden won that race by a narrow margin, prompting a hand tally of all votes cast to confirm the accuracy of vote-tallying scanners. Trump, who falsely claimed fraud cost him the 2020 election, targeted Raffensperger for failing to overturn his narrow loss in Georgia. In a now-notorious January 2021 phone call, Trump suggested Raffensperger could \u201cfind\u201d enough votes to reverse Biden\u2019s presidential victory.  Raffensperger defeated a Trump-endorsed primary challenger in this year\u2019s election contest. For this year\u2019s audit, Georgia election officials hosted a dice roll at the state Capitol to help determine the batches of votes that counties had to count by hand.  In total, county election officials reviewed 328 batches of ballots \u2014 a fraction of the total number of batches. More than 85 percent of those batches had no deviation from the original candidate vote totals. Of the remaining batches, all but one had a discrepancy within an expected margin of error for a hand count, the Secretary of State\u2019s office said. The audit counted 156,832 votes for Raffensperger and 67,486 votes for Nguyen. A machine count of the same ballots had Raffensperger\u2019s vote total at 156,811 and Nguyen\u2019s total at 67,504.  Officials had said such a difference was expected because of human error during the hand counting process. Overall, Raffensperger won more than 2 million votes compared to over 1.7 million for Nguyen, according to his office.  State law requires 90% certainty that the outcome is correct, but Raffensperger said he was increasing that to 95%, that is to say a \u201crisk limit\u201d of 5%.",

    "EXPLAINER: What are special counsels and what do they do?": [
        "By ERIC TUCKER and MEG KINNARDNovember 19, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The appointment of a special counsel to oversee the remainder of two significant investigations related to former President Donald Trump focuses fresh attention on the role such prosecutors have played in modern American history. In this case, Attorney General Merrick Garland has turned to Jack Smith, a veteran war crimes prosecutor with a background in public corruption probes to lead investigations into the retention of classified documents at Trump\u2019s Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, as well as key aspects of a separate probe involving the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and efforts to undo the 2020 election.  A look at the origins of the special counsel, the position\u2019s powers and what to expect as Smith pursues his work: ___ WHAT EXACTLY IS A SPECIAL COUNSEL? A special counsel is an attorney appointed to investigate, and possibly prosecute, a case in which the Justice Department perceives itself as having a conflict or where it\u2019s deemed to be in the public interest to have someone outside the government come in and take responsibility for a matter. According to the Code of Federal Regulations, a special counsel must have \u201ca reputation for integrity and impartial decisionmaking,\u201d as well as \u201can informed understanding of the criminal law and Department of Justice policies.\u201d  Though they\u2019re not subject to the day-to-day supervision of the Justice Department, special counsels must still comply with department regulations, policies and procedures. They also technically report to the attorney general \u2014 the one government official who can fire them. The attorney general is entitled to seek explanations from a special counsel about any requested investigative or prosecutorial step, but under the regulations, is also expected to give great weight to the special counsel\u2019s views. In the event the attorney general rejects a move the special counsel wants to make, the Justice Department is to notify Congress at the end of the investigation. WHAT POWERS DO THEY HAVE? Special counsels are provided with a budget and can request a staff of attorneys, both inside the outside the department, if they need extra help. Smith is expected to inherit the months of work that\u2019s already been done by career prosecutors rather than start from scratch. In addition to the ability to bring indictments, special counsels are vested with bread-and-butter law enforcement tools such as the power to issue subpoenas and search warrants. Robert Mueller, the former FBI director who as special counsel in the Trump administration led the investigation into possible coordination between Russia and the 2016 Trump campaign, issued more than 2,800 subpoenas and executed nearly 500 search-and-seizure warrants. HOW DO INDEPENDENT COUNSELS DIFFER FROM SPECIAL COUNSELS? Smith\u2019s position as special counsel differs in key ways from the work of independent counsels who used to operate outside the supervision of the Justice Department and who led significant investigations in the post-Watergate era into administrations of both political parties. One such independent counsel was Lawrence E. Walsh, who during the \u201cIran Contra Affair\u201d in President Ronald Reagan\u2019s second term was appointed to probe secret arms sales to Iran and the diversion of funds to rebel forces fighting the Nicaraguan government. A decade later, independent counsel Ken Starr investigated fraudulent real estate deals involving a long-time associate of President Bill Clinton and first lady Hillary Clinton, delved into the removal of documents from the office of deputy White House counsel Vincent Foster after his suicide and assembled evidence of Clinton\u2019s sexual encounters with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. As a result, Clinton was impeached by the U.S. House but survived a Senate trial. But amid concerns over the cost and sprawling nature of such probes, Congress in 1999 permitted the provision governing independent counsels to expire.  The Justice Department then created new special counsel regulations, designing a position with intentionally less autonomy for circumstances in which the department feels it has a conflict of interest or wants to avoid becoming excessively entangled in politically sticky matters \u2014 like the current Trump-related probes. Smith isn\u2019t even the first special counsel to deal with Trump-related matters. Mueller was appointed in 2017 to investigate Russian election interference, a two-year probe that yielded criminal charges against 34 people, including several Trump associates, and three business entities. Mueller did not allege a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia. Though Mueller reached no conclusion on whether Trump obstructed justice, he also did not exonerate him.  Weeks before then-Attorney General William Barr left office, he gave John Durham, then the top federal prosecutor in Connecticut, the title of special counsel to ensure that he could continue investigating the origins of the Russia probe under new, Democratic Justice Department leadership. WHO IS SPECIAL COUNSEL JACK SMITH? He\u2019s a veteran prosecutor who for five years oversaw the Justice Department\u2019s public integrity section, which investigates wrongdoing by politicians and election crimes. He arrived in 2010, tasked with restoring a vaunted unit which had rocked by a scandal over the failure to produce exculpatory evidence in a prosecution of former Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens. During his tenure in that job, the unit brought tough cases against prominent public figures of both political parties, including Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell (the Supreme Court ultimately threw out his public corruption conviction) and former Democratic vice presidential nominee John Edwards. A jury in that campaign finance case acquitted him on one count and deadlocked on all others. He later led the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Nashville before becoming vice president of litigation for a non-governmental healthcare provider. More recently, he\u2019s been a prosecutor for the special court in The Hague that investigates war crimes in Kosovo. The Justice Department on Friday described Smith as a registered independent, an effort to blunt any attack of perceived political bias. Trump is a Republican, and Biden is a Democrat. Outside of work, the hard-charging Smith is a competitive athlete who says he\u2019s participated in triathlons around the world.  ___ Kinnard reported from Columbia, S.C. ___ Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP and Meg Kinnard at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP",

        " NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A day after Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced she would step aside, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York launched a history-making bid Friday to become the first Black person to helm a major political party in Congress as leader of the House Democrats. In a letter to colleagues, Jeffries gave a nod to the \u201clegendary figures\u201d before him: Pelosi, the first female speaker in U.S. history, and her leadership team. He encouraged his fellow House members to embrace a \u201conce-in-a-generation opportunity\u201d to unleash their \u201cfull potential as a team.\u201d And he pledged to draw on the diverse Democratic caucus as it works to govern in a divided Congress and win back the majority after House Republicans narrowly seized control in the midterm elections. \u201cThe House Democratic Caucus is the most authentic representation of the gorgeous mosaic of the American people,\u201d Jeffries wrote.  \u201cI write to humbly ask for your support for the position of House Democratic Leader as we once again prepare to meet the moment.\u201d Along with Pelosi, the other top two House Democrats \u2014 Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader, and Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, the whip \u2014 also announced their intentions to step down from the top posts. All three are in their 80s. Clyburn is stepping down as whip but says he wants to remain in leadership.  A new generation wasted no time preparing to take their place. Along with Jeffries, Reps. Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and Pete Aguilar of California \u2014 who have worked together as a lower-rung leadership team \u2014 swiftly wrote to colleagues with their bids for the second- and third-ranking positions in House Democratic leadership. Jeffries and Clark are in their 50s, while Aguilar is in his 40s. The trio has been working together for years, preparing for just this moment, seeking to engineer a smooth transition when Pelosi, Hoyer and Clyburn decided to leave. Pelosi heartily backed the potential new leaders. \u201cIt is with pride, gratitude and confidence in their abilities that I salute Chairman Hakeem Jeffries, Assistant Speaker Katherine Clark and Vice Chairman Pete Aguilar for being ready and willing to assume this awesome responsibility,\u201d Pelosi said Friday in a statement. House Democrats will meet behind closed doors as a caucus in two weeks, after the Thanksgiving holiday, to select their members. So far, Jeffries, Clark and Aguilar have no stated challengers. The Brooklyn-born Jeffries has long been seen as a charismatic new leader, known for his sharp but careful style, first in New York politics and then when he entered the national stage upon winning election to Congress in 2012. A former corporate lawyer and state assemblyman, Jeffries has represented Brooklyn and parts of Queens for a decade and quickly rose through the ranks in Congress, serving as the party\u2019s 5th-highest-ranking member as chair of the House Democratic Caucus.  \u201cYou could sense there was some purpose in him,\u201d said the Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader, recalling the quiet and pensive young lawmaker he first met decades go.  \u201cHe always seemed like a guy that was headed somewhere but was willing to pace himself to get there,\u201d Sharpton said. \u201cYou meet a lot of people that are ambitious, that would do anything. You never got that impression from Hakeem.\u201d  While Jeffries has been part of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, he\u2019s seen as a more moderate, business-friendly lawmaker who is sometimes at odds with the House\u2019s furthest-left members.  But his appeal rests in his political skill at a transformative time as Pelosi and her team make way for a new era.  Carl Heastie, a Democratic state lawmaker who became the first Black person to serve as the speaker of the New York State Assembly, bonded with Jeffries on the campaign trail two decades ago over a love of hip-hop. \u201cHakeem had that \u2018it\u2019 factor,\u201d Heastie said. \u201cHe stands out in the room.\u201d If Jeffries is chosen to serve as the minority leader, the Democrats will be led in both chambers of Congress by men from Brooklyn \u2014 Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Brooklyn native, lives in a neighborhood near where Jeffries lives with his wife and two sons.  His district includes the Black cultural hub of the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, home to Jackie Robinson and once represented by Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman elected to Congress. The job of minority leader puts Jeffries in line to become speaker if Democrats regain House control. \u201cAnother glass ceiling broken,\u201d said Rep. James McGovern, D-Mass., about his colleague\u2019s rise. \u201cI look forward to be able to call him speaker.\u201d Jeffries first won election to the House in 2012, replacing Democrat Edolphus Towns, who decided to retire instead of facing what was expected to be a tough primary challenge from Jeffries.  Growing up in Brooklyn\u2019s Crown Heights neighborhood, Jeffries attended New York City public schools before graduating from the State University of New York at Binghamton, where he studied political science. He received a master\u2019s in public policy from Georgetown University and a law degree from New York University.  He clerked for a federal judge and worked for several years at a New York City law firm and later as a corporate lawyer for CBS. His first runs for public office were strong back-to-back but unsuccessful attempts to unseat longtime Democratic state Assemblyman Roger Green starting in 2000. New York Attorney General Letitia James, who was Green\u2019s campaign manager, said Jeffries was then \u201can up-and-coming insurgent\u201d who \u201cwanted to make his mark in central Brooklyn \u2014 and in fact, he did.\u201d When the seat opened in 2006, Jeffries won. He served six years in Albany, working on criminal justice and civil rights legislation.  He sponsored a law that stopped the New York Police Department from keeping a database of personal details of every person stopped and questioned under the department\u2019s controversial stop-and-frisk tactic, even if the people were released and not charged with a crime.  He continued that work in Congress. After the 2014 chokehold death in New York of Eric Garner, a Black man whose gasps of \u201cI can\u2019t breathe!\u201d became part a national rallying cry against police brutality, Jeffries sought to pass legislation that would make the chokehold maneuver a federal crime. James, who rose up through the same Brooklyn Democratic political circles as Jeffries and worked with him on affordable housing issues when she was on the City Council, said she reached out to Jeffries on Thursday night. \u201cI texted him and urged him not to forget the residents of public housing we served,\u201d James said. \u201cAnd he answered back and said, \u2018Never.\u2019\u201d ___ Mascaro reported from Washington.",

    "Ohio\u2019s Intel project triggers housing fears in tight market": [
        "By ANDREW WELSH-HUGGINSNovember 19, 2022 GMT",
        " COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Intel\u2019s announcement earlier this year of a $20 billion manufacturing operation bringing thousands of jobs to rural Ohio was greeted as an economic boon. But behind that enthusiasm lurked a pressing question. \u201cWhere are we putting everybody?\u201d asked Melissa Humbert-Washington, vice president of programs and services at Homes for Families, which helps low-wage workers find housing in a region already suffering a major shortage. Intel says its initial two computer chip factories will employ 3,000 people when the operation is up and running in 2025. The project is also expected to employ 7,000 construction workers. And none of that includes the hundreds of additional jobs as Intel suppliers move in, along with the expected boom in the service sector. Such housing challenges are playing out across the country as companies increasingly come under fire for failing to consider the shelter needs of their new employees or the impact big developments will have on already tight housing markets. Experts agree that years of underbuilding dating to the Great Recession of 2008 has caused widespread housing shortages. Nationally, the country is short about 1 million homes, according to Rob Dietz, senior economist at the National Association of Home Builders. The National Apartment Association estimates a rental shortage of about 600,000 units. \u201cWe have underbuilt housing by millions of homes over the past 15 years,\u201d said Dennis Shea, executive director of the J. Ronald Terwilliger Center for Housing Policy. \u201cSo when a big company comes into a community that is supply constrained, the demand that they\u2019re going to inject ... is going to affect home prices and rental prices because there\u2019s more demand than supply.\u201d For a big company\u2019s impact on housing, look no farther than Intel\u2019s own operations in Chandler, Arizona, which grew from a small agricultural city of about 30,000 in 1980 when the company built its first factory to a high-tech metropolis of 220,000 today. That was accompanied by tremendous housing growth, and today Chandler is running out of developable land, with nearly 95% of the area built out with residential, office, industrial and retail projects, according to the Greater Phoenix Economic Council. Housing is also more expensive in Chandler, with a median home sale price of $525,000 compared to $455,000 in greater Phoenix, and median rents of $2,027 compared to $1,950 in Phoenix. The challenge for areas like rural Ohio is that they don\u2019t have local employees to build or staff a large project, said Mark Stapp, director of the Center for Real Estate Theory and Practice at Arizona State University. There\u2019s neither the housing nor the infrastructure to accommodate the thousands of new arrivals, increasing housing prices and possibly forcing existing residents out. \u201cIt\u2019s economic development. It\u2019s going to employ people. But you are probably going to have to bring a lot of people into the area,\u201d he said. And \u201cthose jobs require housing.\u201d  \u201cIf you don\u2019t recognize that and don\u2019t properly plan infrastructure, land use policies and manage that growth, it can be a big problem. The great opportunity turns into a big problem.\u201d In central Ohio, the Intel site is rising on hundreds of acres of rural land once occupied by farm fields and modest homes where large business parks have also sprung up near major thoroughfares. The region has averaged about 8,200 building permits per year for both single-family and multi-unit buildings, even as job and population growth estimates predating the Intel project called for more than twice that, according to the Building Industry Association of Central Ohio. \u201cWe\u2019re not building enough of anything,\u201d said the group\u2019s executive director Jon Melchi. Central Ohio, with about 2.4 million residents today, will grow to at least 3 million by 2050, the group said. The central Ohio shortage includes the \u201cmissing middle\u201d of workforce housing, or homes up to $250,000, said Tre\u2019 Giller, CEO and president of Metro Development, one of Ohio\u2019s largest apartment developers. A recent Zillow search showed only about 570 listings for homes $250,000 or less in the area.  The housing pressure is especially intense for low-wage workers. Central Ohio already has about 71,000 households considered \u201cseverely rent burdened\u201d \u2014 families spending more than half their income on housing, said the Coalition on Homelessness and Housing in Ohio. The region has only 34 affordable units available for every 100 low-rent households, it said. The problem is even more severe in Licking County, home to the future Intel plants, where more than one in five renters are considered severely rent burdened. Affordable housing is crucial for the low-wage workers who keep the economy running, from pre-school teachers to medical assistants, said COHIO executive director Amy Riegel. But housing also has to be viewed on a spectrum: Without enough higher-end properties to purchase, buyers will snap up rentals, which then shuts out workers of limited means. \u201cHousing is definitely an ecosystem,\u201d Riegel said. \u201cIf you add housing at one end, and don\u2019t take care of the other end, it has an impact and a ripple effect through the whole system.\u201d On the Nov. 8 ballot, Columbus voters approved a $200 million bond issue aimed at increasing the city\u2019s affordable housing stock for homeowners earning less than $50,000 annually. \u201cWe simply do not have enough places for people to live,\u201d Mayor Andrew Ginther said in announcing the issue in July. Janna Sharrett is grateful for her apartment in an affordable housing complex in suburban Columbus as the region braces for Intel\u2019s arrival and its real estate impact. The 60-year-old customer service rep works from home and earns just $14.94 an hour. Her rent on the one-bedroom apartment she shares with her dog, Bella, and cat, Daisy, is $695.  The $6.5 million, 28-unit building where Sharrett lives was developed by Homeport, a Columbus-based nonprofit that works to expand affordable housing. Sharrett moved in two years ago seeking relief from a $1,000 rent payment, and today isn\u2019t sure what she\u2019d do without it. She worries about the needs of people like herself as the region grows through projects such as Intel. \u201cRent is outrageous. Prices of homes are outrageous. And my income is not outrageous,\u201d Sharrett said. Across the country, a growing number of companies are responding to housing concerns by rolling out ambitious plans for thousands of units of new housing \u2014 though efforts fall far short of actual needs. In 2021, Amazon launched its $2 billion Housing Equity Fund to create over 8,000 affordable homes across three regions where it operates: the Puget Sound in Washington state; Arlington, Virginia, and Nashville, Tennessee. In 2019, Apple said it would commit $2.5 billion toward easing California\u2019s housing crisis, one of a number of initiatives by high tech companies. This month Walt Disney World picked a developer to construct affordable housing on 80 acres of its land in Orange County, Florida. Intel, too, looks forward to partnering with Ohio community leaders to prepare for the increased housing demand over the next few years, said Intel spokesperson Linda Qian, without providing details. Experts say it\u2019s in Intel\u2019s best interest to contribute toward alleviating the region\u2019s housing shortage. Employers in greater Columbus already blame high worker turnover and reduced productivity on long commute times, according to a report by the Affordable Housing Alliance of Central Ohio. \u201cWithout the housing product it can easily stifle the workforce needs of Intel and others,\u201d said Jamie Green, a Columbus-based planning consultant. As the Intel project unfolds, it highlights the challenges ahead, said Leah Evans, president and CEO of Homeport, which developed Sharrett\u2019s affordable apartment complex. \u201cThis just brought to light that for every one job you create, you\u2019ve got a commute and you\u2019ve got a housing unit\u201d need, Evans said. \u201cYou have to be thinking about all those things.\u201d ___ Michael Casey in Boston contributed to this report.",

    "Election conspiracists claim some races for local offices": [
        "By NICHOLAS RICCARDINovember 19, 2022 GMT",
        " As voting experts cheered the losses of election conspiracy theorists in numerous high-profile races on Election Day, Paddy McGuire prepared to hand over his office to one of them. McGuire, the auditor of Mason County in western Washington, lost his reelection bid to Steve Duenkel, a Republican who has echoed former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies about the 2020 election. Duenkel, who invited a prominent election conspiracist to the area and led a door-to-door effort to find voter fraud, defeated McGuire by 100 votes in the conservative-leaning county of 60,000. \u201cThere are all these stories about the election denier secretary of state candidates who lost in purple states,\u201d said McGuire, referring to the state office that normally oversees voting. \u201cBut secretaries of state don\u2019t count ballots. Those of us on the ground, whether we\u2019re clerks or auditors or recorders, do.\u201d Republicans who supported Trump\u2019s effort to overturn the 2020 election lost bids for statewide offices that play key roles in overseeing voting in the six states that decided the last presidential election, as well as in races across the country. But an untold number won in local elections to control the positions that run on-the-ground election operations in counties, cities and townships across the country. \u201cWithout a doubt, election denial is alive and well, and this is a continuing threat,\u201d said Joanna Lydgate of States United, a group highlighting the risk of election conspiracy theorists trying to take over election administration. Of the nine Republicans running for secretary of state who echoed Trump\u2019s lies about the 2020 presidential election or supported his efforts to overturn its results, three won \u2014 all in Republican-dominated states. In Alabama, state Rep. Wes Allen isn\u2019t even waiting to take office before making waves. Last week, he announced that once he becomes secretary of state he will withdraw from ERIC, a multistate database of voter registrations. The system is designed to notify states when voters need to be removed because they\u2019ve relocated, but it\u2019s become a target of election conspiracy theorists. Allen echoed those conspiracy theories during his campaign, but in a statement last week he instead said he was motivated by a desire to protect the privacy of Alabama voters. His call to exit ERIC drew a stark rebuke from the state\u2019s outgoing secretary of state, John Merrill, a fellow Republican. \u201cSo, if Wes Allen plans to remove Alabama from its relationship with ERIC, how does he intend to maintain election security without access to the necessary data, legal authority, or capability to conduct proper voter list maintenance?\u201d Merrill\u2019s office said in a statement, referencing how ERIC flags when a voter has moved out of state and can be removed from Alabama\u2019s rolls. In deeply conservative Wyoming, Republican Chuck Gray was the only candidate for secretary of state on the ballot. Once he won the GOP primary in August, his ascension was guaranteed. In Indiana, Diego Morales ousted the incumbent secretary of state, a fellow Republican, during the party\u2019s nominating convention by echoing Trump\u2019s conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election. He reined in his rhetoric during his successful general election campaign. Morales did not respond to a request for comment. He was the only one of 17 Republican election conspiracists in a group called the America First Secretary of State Coalition to win his general election race. The record is far murkier at the local level, where elections are actually run and ballots are counted. There are thousands of separate election offices in the U.S. In many states, elections are conducted by county offices overseen by clerks or auditors, though in some they are administered at the municipal level in cities or even townships. No organization tracks local election offices. The Democratic group Run for Something, alarmed at the prospect of election conspiracists occupying these posts, started an initiative to support candidates it dubbed \u201cdefenders of democracy\u201d this year. It estimated 1,700 separate elections were being held either for posts to run elections, or for bodies such as county commissions that appoint election directors. Amanda Litman, co-founder of the organization, said the group was tracking 32 races where they supported candidates. Their candidate won in 17 races and lost in 12, while three have yet to be called. Most significantly, she said, they won eight races against election deniers, and lost only three. \u201cIt\u2019s generally a good sign that when you\u2019re able to make the stakes of the race about democracy, you win,\u201d Litman said. Still, she added, it\u2019s hard to track all the potential election conspiracy theorists who got into local office: \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit unknowable.\u201d Some prominent election conspiracy theorists did win local posts. In the Atlanta area, Bridget Thorne, who attended numerous meetings of the Fulton County Commission to talk about conspiracy theories revolving around the 2020 election, won a post on the commission. However, it\u2019s dominated by Democrats, so she likely will have limited ability to bring pressure on the county\u2019s elections department. In Washoe County, the swing area in Nevada that includes Reno, Republican Mike Clark won one of the five county commission seats. He told a local newspaper that \u201cI don\u2019t have any personal knowledge\u201d of whether President Joe Biden legitimately won the 2020 election. And in Mason County, Duenkel spread conspiracy theories about local and national elections. He helped lead a group of volunteers who went door-to-door checking for voters who didn\u2019t live where they were registered, and claimed they had found thousands. A local television station retraced their steps and found numerous errors by the group. Still, every Republican on the ballot won Mason County this election. McGuire said he called Duenkel to congratulate him and left him a voice mail, but never got a call back. Duenkel also did not respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press. \u201cHe got more votes than me and he won,\u201d McGuire said. \u201cThat\u2019s what an election professional does \u2014 respect the will of the voters and stand behind the results, whether one is happy about the outcome or not.\u201d ___ Learn more about the issues and factors at play in the midterms at https://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-elections.

    "In Pelosi, women admire a leader with calm, cool confidence": [
        "By MARYCLAIRE DALENovember 19, 2022 GMT",
        " PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 As they watched House Speaker Nancy Pelosi step forward to wrangle an unruly Congress over the years or stare down a bombastic president, many women across the country saw a version of the calm, confident leader they hoped to be themselves.  Pelosi, in rooms full of powerful men, was tenacious, tactical, tough. All while being a devoted mother and grandmother at home. And rarely finding the need to raise her voice.  \u201cThe image of her coming out in the red coat was just always amusing to me because it just kind of personified how badass she is,\u201d said Gina Lind, 61, of Phoenix, a marketing director for an airline. \u201cIt completely represented a woman in quiet control.\u201d  After her announcement this week that she would step down from Democratic leadership after two decades, many people reposted that meme of Pelosi confidently striding out of the Trump White House in sunglasses and a long red coat following a tense meeting. The moment was a reminder of how Pelosi, the first woman to become House speaker, redefined outdated expectations about the role of women in the highest levels of government. Fans of Pelosi, a California Democrat, have taped the image to their refrigerator, downloaded it as a screensaver or emblazoned it on coffee mugs. They likewise savor the photos of her confronting then-President Donald Trump in the White House Cabinet Room or ripping up his final State of the Union speech.  \u201cWhen I look at that (Cabinet Room) picture, I think, \u2018Okay, stand up and say what you have to say,\u2019\u201d said Kelly Haggerty, 49, an engineer for the city of Syracuse, New York, who works on construction projects and often finds herself, like Pelosi, squaring off in a room full of men.  \u201cI mean, these guys across the table from me are not the president of the United States, but it\u2019s not fun to always be the only woman in the room,\u201d said Haggerty, who called the photo inspiring. \u201cI did put it on my refrigerator because I have two teenage girls, and I want them to be the same way. I don\u2019t want them to ever stand down,\u201d she said. Like many other women of her generation, Pelosi did not formally start her career until she was in her late 40s and her five children were mostly grown. But her father had been in politics, serving first as the mayor of Baltimore and then in Congress. And Pelosi, in her leadership farewell speech from the House floor on Thursday, recalled being awed by the sight of the Capitol building at the age of 6.  \u201cMake no mistake, though, she\u2019s been in politics since she was born, whether she was running for office or not,\u201d said Rep. Karen Bass, a fellow California Democrat who is now the incoming mayor of Los Angeles. In her view, Pelosi embraces her power without being \u201cheavy-handed about it.\u201d She credits Pelosi with standing firm during the tumultuous Trump years. \u201cWomen do lead differently, and have to leverage their power in a way that is just different, and I think she has perfected that,\u201d she said. \u201c(But) if anybody has to go up against her, good luck.\u201d And that female strength and tenacity are what angers people about Pelosi, Hillary Clinton and other female leaders, some women believe. \u201cPeople expect us to be nice all the time. If and when we don\u2019t behave in that particular \u2018box,\u2019 people can get pretty emotional and angry about that,\u201d said Maryland state Sen. Sarah Elfreth, 34, a Democrat.  \u201cI think she took an undue amount of criticism for doing the job the same way and often times better than men had done that job,\u201d Elfreth said. \u201cAnd in doing so she paves the way for other women in elected office to be just as tough and just as resilient.\u201d If the country has yet to see a female president, the younger generations have at least seen Pelosi and a growing number of other women in Congress working beside her. When Pelosi first came to Congress in 1987, she had only two dozen female colleagues among the 535 lawmakers. This year, there are 147 women in the House and Senate \u2014 and a growing number of female governors. \u201cI think we take for granted how that (Pelosi\u2019s leadership) has transformed what it means to be a woman in power, maybe what it means to be a woman executive, and I think that in years to come we\u2019ll be especially grateful to her for breaking that glass ceiling,\u201d said Cecilia Ritacco, a 22-year-old graduate student in government studies at Georgetown University. ___ Follow Maryclaire Dale on Twitter at https://twitter.com/Maryclairedale",

    "Trump 2024 rivals court his donors at big Las Vegas meeting": [
        "By STEVE PEOPLESNovember 19, 2022 GMT",
        " LAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 The Republican Party\u2019s nascent 2024 class, emboldened as ever, openly cast Donald Trump as \u201ca loser\u201d over and over on Friday as they courted donors and activists fretting about the GOP\u2019s future under the former president\u2019s leadership. Trump\u2019s vocal critics included current and former Republican governors, members of his own Cabinet and major donors who gathered along the Las Vegas strip for what organizers described as the unofficial beginning of the next presidential primary season. It was a remarkable display of defiance for a party defined almost wholly by its allegiance to Trump for the past six years. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s a little blood in the water and the sharks are circling,\u201d Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican presidential prospect himself and frequent Trump critic said in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever gotten to this point before.\u201d The gathering of the Republican Jewish Coalition\u2019s annual leadership meeting, which began Friday, comes just days after Trump became the first candidate to formally launch a 2024 campaign. His allies hoped his early announcement might ward off serious primary challenges, but several potential candidates said that\u2019s not likely after Trump loyalists lost midterm contests last week in battleground states from Arizona to Pennsylvania. His political standing within the GOP, already weakening, plummeted further. Ahead of his Friday night address, Mike Pompeo, the former Secretary of State under Trump, mocked one of his former boss\u2019 slogans: \u201cWe were told we\u2019d get tired of winning. But I\u2019m tired of losing.\u201d \u201cPersonality, celebrity just aren\u2019t going to get it done,\u201d he said later from the ballroom stage. Trump is scheduled to address the weekend gathering by video conference on Saturday. The vast majority of the high-profile Republican officials considering a 2024 White House bid appeared in person the two-day conference, which included a series of private donor meetings and public speeches. The program featured DeSantis, a leading Trump rival, and Pence, whom Trump blames for not overturning the 2020 election. Other speakers included Hogan, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu and Florida Sen. Rick Scott. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, another potential 2024 contender, canceled his appearance after a Sunday shooting at the University of Virginia that left three dead. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, who could become the House speaker when Republicans take over in January, is also scheduled.  There seemed to be little sympathy for Trump\u2019s latest legal challenges.  Hours before Friday\u2019s opening dinner, Attorney General Merrick Garland named a special counsel to oversee the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into the presence of classified documents at Trump\u2019s Florida estate as well as key aspects of a separate probe involving the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and efforts to undo the 2020 election. Sununu, the New Hampshire governor who easily won reelection last week, said there was no sign that his party would rally to Trump\u2019s defense this time.  \u201cThose are his issues to sort out,\u201d Sununu said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s gonna sit back and watch the show. And that\u2019s not just his supporters \u2014 that\u2019s his money, that\u2019s donors, that\u2019s fundraisers,\u201d said the Republican governor, who easily won reelection last week. \u201cWe\u2019re just moving on.\u201d  With a loyal base of support among rank-and-file voters and a sprawling fundraising operation featuring small-dollar contributions, Trump does not need major donors or party leaders to reach for the GOP nomination a third time. But unwillingness by big-money Republicans to commit to him \u2014 at least, for now \u2014 could make his path back to the White House more difficult.  There was little sign of enthusiasm for Trump\u2019s 2024 presidential aspirations in the hallways and conference rooms of the weekend gathering. At Friday night\u2019s dinner, organizers offered attendees yarmulkes bearing Trump\u2019s name, but there were few takers.  That\u2019s even as Jewish Republicans continued to heap praise on Trump\u2019s commitment to Israel while in the White House. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that what President Trump accomplished over his four years in terms of strengthening the the U.S.-Israel relationship was unparalleled. He was the most pro-Israel president ever,\u201d said Matt Brooks, the Republican Jewish Coalition\u2019s executive director.  But that may not be enough to win over the coalition\u2019s leading donors this time.  \u201cFor a lot of people who are attending this conference, this is about the future,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cAnd for some of them, President Trump may be their answer. For others, they\u2019re interested in what others have to say.\u201d New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie leaned into Trump\u2019s political failures during a private dinner with the group\u2019s leading donors on Thursday. In a subsequent interview, he did not back down.  \u201cIn my view, he\u2019s now a loser. He\u2019s an electoral loser,\u201d said Christie, another 2024 prospect. \u201cYou look at a general electorate, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a Democrat he can beat because he\u2019s now toxic to suburban voters on a personal level, and he\u2019s earned it.\u201d The annual event is playing out at the Las Vegas Strip\u2019s Venetian Hotel in a nod to the Republican Jewish Coalition\u2019s longtime benefactor, Sheldon Adelson, a billionaire casino magnate who died last year. His wife Miriam Adelson remains a fundraising force within the GOP, though her level of giving in the recent midterm election, which exceeded $20 million, was somewhat scaled back. The 76-year-old Israeli-born Miriam Adelson \u201cis staying neutral\u201d in the GOP\u2019s 2024 presidential primary, according to the family\u2019s longtime political gatekeeper Andy Abboud.  She is not alone. Ronald Lauder, the president of the World Jewish Congress and heir to the Estee Lauder cosmetics fortune, backed Trump\u2019s previous campaigns but has no plans to support him in 2024, according to a Lauder spokesman.  Longtime Trump backer Stephen A. Schwarzman, chairman and CEO of the Blackstone Group investment firm, told Axios this week that he would back someone from a \u201cnew generation\u201d of Republicans. Kenneth C. Griffin, the hedge-fund billionaire, is already openly backing DeSantis.  On Friday, aerospace CEO Phillip Friedman described himself as a \u201cbig Trump supporter,\u201d but said he\u2019s open to listening to others moving forward. \u201cThere\u2019s a couple other people who have his policies but don\u2019t have the baggage,\u201d Friedman said of Trump.  In his keynote address, Pence focused largely on the Trump administration\u2019s accomplishments, but included a few indirect jabs at the former president.  \u201cTo win the future,\u201d Pence said, \u201cwe as Republicans and elected leaders must do more than criticize and complain.\u201d He was more direct i n an interview this week. \u201cI think we will have better choices in 2024,\u201d Pence told The Associated Press. \u201cAnd I\u2019m very confident that Republican primary voters will choose wisely.\u201d ___ AP writer Michelle Price in New York contributed.

    "Election certification avoiding chaos, except in Arizona": [
        "By MORGAN LEE and SCOTT SONNERNovember 19, 2022 GMT",
        " SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) \u2014 Certification of this year\u2019s midterm election results appears to be proceeding smoothly with little controversy across the country, with a small Arizona county being a rare exception, calming fears that local commissions consumed by talk of election conspiracies would create chaos by refusing to validate the will of the voters. Action has been orderly even in places where suspicions about election fairness ran deep and led to bitter clashes at local public meetings. In Nevada, a state that has been a hotbed of election conspiracy accusations and movements to ditch voting machines in favor of hand-counting all ballots, all 17 counties met a Friday-night deadline to certify election results. In rural Elko County, the county commission unanimously certified the results just weeks after questioning the reliability of voting machines and expressing support for hand-counting all ballots. Commissioners praised county Clerk Kris Jakeman for a post-election audit that included random hand-counts backing up the results from machine tabulators. Some commissioners had watched the audit and said it helped relieve some of their skepticism. \u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot this year,\u201d said Commissioner Delmo Andreozzi. \u201cAnd I appreciate everybody\u2019s willingness to help educate me and help me become more aware about the whole process.\u201d It was much the same story in New Mexico, where several rural county commissions have been under intense pressure by some residents to reject certification since the state\u2019s primary election in June. In Otero County, where a crisis occurred this summer when commissioners initially denied certification after the primary, the general election results were certified this week with a drama-free unanimous vote. \u201cIn my heart of hearts, I think Otero County does a good job,\u201d Commission Chairwoman Vickie Marquardt said. \u201cI have no reason not to certify this election.\u201d In another rural New Mexico county, where a livid crowd in June berated county commissioners as \u201ccowards\u201d and \u201ctraitors\u201d as they certified the primary results, the room fell silent this week as the all-Republican board pored over vote tallies and signatures from poll judges. Commissioners peppered Torrance County election officials with questions before voting 3-0 to certify. The commission had spent months responding to doubts about voting systems with a hand recount of the primary ballots and invitations to attend security testing of ballot-counting machines. \u201cI\u2019m not seeing any discrepancies, commissioners. Are you?\u201d Republican commission Chairman Ryan Schwebach told colleagues. He won reelection to the local post with roughly two-thirds of the vote, defeating a challenger who said vote-counting machines can\u2019t be trusted. All but one county in New Mexico certified vote tallies this week. Conspiracy-focused protesters rallied Friday outside an election board meeting in Reno, Nevada, with signs reading \u201cDon\u2019t certify before hand count\u201d and \u201cWe the people demand hand count.\u201d Despite the protests, the Washoe County commission voted 4-1 to certify the results. County Commissioner Jeanne Herman, who represents the most rural part of the county, which stretches north to the border with Oregon, cast the lone dissenting vote. She made a failed attempt earlier this year to push an election reform package that, among other things, would have posted National Guard troops at polling places and relied almost exclusively on paper ballots. Christiane Brown, a Reno gun control activist, told the commission that the system worked this year, and even most candidates who had embraced the 2020 election falsehoods conceded defeat. \u201cDenying results does not change them,\u201d she said. \u201cThe people rejected lies, disinformation, intimidation and ignorance, as well as hatred. The voters spoke, the system worked, and the rule of law held.\u201d  In Arizona, the state\u2019s 15 counties are just beginning to certify their election results and have until Nov. 28 to do their canvass and send final vote tallies to the secretary of state. Kari Lake, the Republican who lost the race for governor, has refused to concede and in a Thursday video said she has a team of lawyers reviewing whether Election Day issues at the polls disenfranchised some voters. The two Republicans who control the board in southeastern Arizona\u2019s Cochise County delayed their certification Friday night after hearing from a trio of conspiracy theorists who argue vote-counting machines are not certified. The board ignored testimony from the state elections director, who said the contention was false. The board delayed the vote until the Nov. 28 deadline, saying they wanted to see proof and have the three men evaluate it. State Elections Director Kori Lorick threatened legal action \u201cto compel compliance\u201d and ensure that votes from about 46,000 residents were property reported.  The state is set to certify results from all 15 counties on Dec. 5, a move needed before a recount can proceed in the race for state attorney general, which is too close to call. Under Arizona law, the only role of the elected county boards is to accept the numbers as they are tallied by their elections departments. If they refuse to do so, either the secretary of state or a candidate would sue. Election certification emerged as an issue after the 2020 presidential election in Michigan, where Trump and his allies pressured Republicans on both the state certification board and the one for Wayne County, which includes Detroit. The results, showing Democrat Joe Biden winning the state by 154,000 votes, were eventually certified. Detroit City Clerk Janice Winfrey said her office anticipates having no problems with certification of the Nov. 8 general election. By midday Friday, 71 of the state\u2019s 83 counties had certified results. \u201cMore Michigan citizens cast ballots than ever before in a midterm election, and now bipartisan canvassing boards across the state are certifying the results in accordance with state law,\u201d said Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. \u201cWe are optimistic that all canvassers will continue to demonstrate this level of professionalism and commitment to upholding the will of the voters.\u201d ___ Sonner reported from Reno, Nevada.

    "Leak at Pennsylvania gas storage well spewing methane": [
        "By MICHAEL BIESECKER and MICHAEL RUBINKAMNovember 19, 2022 GMT",
        " A vent at an underground natural gas storage well in Western Pennsylvania has been spewing massive amounts of planet-warming methane into the atmosphere for more than 11 days and attempts to plug the leak have thus far failed. Owner Equitrans Midstream said the well at its Rager Mountain storage facility, located in a rural area about 1.5 hours east of Pittsburgh, is venting about 100 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, according to initial estimates. If accurate, that would total 1.1 billion cubic feet in emissions so far, equal to the greenhouse gas emissions from burning 1,080 rail cars of coal. Pennsylvania environmental regulators issued the company notice of five potential violations of state law. As a precaution, the Federal Aviation Administration has restricted aircraft from within a 1-mile radius of the leaking well. A written statement provided Friday by Equitrans spokeswoman Natalie Cox said \u201cthere are no immediate public safety concerns\u201d and the company has been working with a specialty well services company to plug the leak, which was first reported Nov. 6. The Rager facility is in Jackson Township, at the heart of the Marcellus Shale formation that has seen a boom in gas production since the introduction of hydraulic fracturing more than a decade ago. Residents living as far as four miles away from the leak told The Associated Press on Friday they could hear the roar of pressurized gas escaping from the well and could smell the fumes. Tracey Ryan, who homeschools her two young children at her house about three miles away, said the air reeks of sulfur and the noise is so bad she has had trouble sleeping. \u201cWhen you\u2019re laying in bed at night, it sounds like a jet plane taking off,\u201d said the 39-year-old mother. \u201dIt\u2019s unreal, the noise that\u2019s coming, and it\u2019s constant. ... Everybody just keeps telling us we\u2019re safe. But it doesn\u2019t feel safe if you can hear it and smell it.\u201d Methane, the primary component of natural gas, is colorless and odorless. But when the gas is processed for transport and sale, producers add a chemical called mercaptan to give it a distinctive \u201crotten egg\u201d smell that helps make people aware of leaks. Methane\u2019s earth-warming power is some 83 times stronger over 20 years than the carbon dioxide that comes from car tailpipes and power plant smokestacks. Oil and gas companies are the top industrial emitters of methane, which, once released into the atmosphere, will be disrupting the climate for decades, contributing to more heat waves, hurricanes, wildfires and floods. The new leak comes as the Environmental Protection Agency on Nov. 11 updated proposed new rules intended to cut methane and other harmful emissions from oil and gas operations. The Rager facility has 10 storage wells with a total storage capacity of 9 billion cubic feet of natural gas. Equitrans announced Thursday the leak had been stopped when workers flooded the leaking well, but the hiss of venting gas returned early Friday morning. Cox cautioned the estimate of 100 million cubic feet of natural gas leaking per day is preliminary and the company would be unable to provide an accurate account of the gas lost until an inventory verification study is completed. The initial estimate would potentially put the Rager leak as smaller but comparable to the daily emissions from the worst uncontrolled gas leaks in U.S. history \u2014 a 2018 blowout at an Ohio gas well owned by a subsidiary of ExxonMobil and the 2015 disaster at the Aliso Canyon storage facility in California. The citations issued against the company by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection include failures to properly maintain and operate the gas facility, creating a public nuisance and producing a \u201chazard to public health a safety.\u201d The company was also cited for failing to provide state inspectors \u201cfree and unrestricted access.\u201d Lauren Camarda, spokeswoman for the state environmental agency, said that when members of a state emergency response team first arrived at the site on Nov. 7 they were initially barred from entering and told \u201caccess was restricted to critical personnel only.\u201d Cox said that when the state team arrived, Equitrans\u2019 contractors were still in the process of implementing a safety boundary to avoid introducing a potential ignition source that could ignite the highly flammable methane leaking into the air. The gas is coming from a vent designed to relieve intense pressures building up in the well and prevent a blowout. Cox said the company is now withdrawing gas from four storage wells to reduce the overall pressure in the field. Efforts to plug the leak were expected to continue through the weekend, including attempts to plug the well with concrete. Nearby residents said a resolution can\u2019t come soon enough. Edana Glessner, who runs a wedding venue 3.6 miles from the well site, said the smell was making her nauseous and impacted her business. \u201cYou could hear it during the last wedding we had,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it smelled, but everybody was OK with it. We said we\u2019re really sorry.\u201d ____ Biesecker reported from Washington and Rubinkam from northeastern Pennsylvania.",

    "Frisch concedes race against Boebert as it goes to recount": [
        "By JESSE BEDAYNNovember 18, 2022 GMT",
        " DENVER (AP) \u2014 While conceding his tight U.S. House race to Republican Lauren Boebert, Democrat Adam Frisch said on Friday that his surprisingly strong campaign showed just how tired many GOP voters are of Boebert\u2019s brash style. The Associated Press has declared the election in Colorado\u2019s sprawling 3rd Congressional District too close to call. AP will await the results of a potential recount to call the race. With nearly all votes counted, the incumbent Boebert leads Frisch by about 0.17 percentage points, or 554 votes out of over 327,000 votes counted.  The unexpectedly close margin for Boebert, one of Congress\u2019s staunchest supporters of former President Donald Trump, was the latest indication that Trump\u2019s influence on Republican voters could be waning amid a nationwide fight over the direction of the Republican Party. It is a question some Republican leaders raised in partly blaming Trump for their dismal midterm results even as the former president forged ahead in launching his 2024 presidential bid. \u201cAmerica is tired of the circus, tired of the lack of respect for our institutions and democracy, and tired of the lack of civility in our discourse,\u201d Frisch said. The Democrat added that he hasn\u2019t ruled out another bid for the seat in 2024. Prognosticators, pundits and the political establishment had largely thought Frisch\u2019s campaign futile, but the thin margin is its own small victory for the Democrat.  \u201cWe were written off by the political class, we were written off by the donor class and we were written off by the political media,\u201d Frisch told the AP. \u201cI wish more people didn\u2019t take nine months to call me back.\u201d Frisch said he supports the mandatory recount but that it would be unrealistic to think it would flip enough votes for him to win. He called Boebert to concede the race.  In Colorado, a mandatory recount is triggered when the margin of votes between the top two candidates is at or below 0.5% of the leading candidate\u2019s vote total. That margin was around 0.34% on Friday. Frisch\u2019s comments come after Boebert claimed victory late Thursday in a tweeted video of her standing in front of the U.S. Capitol.  \u201cCome January, you can be certain of two things,\u201d said Boebert before thanking her supporters, \u201cI will be sworn in for my second term as your congresswoman and Republicans can finally turn Pelosi\u2019s house back into the People\u2019s House.\u201d In the mold of Trump, Boebert\u2019s provocative style has galvanized anti-establishment angst and won a loyal following on the right. With frequent TV appearances and a near-household name, the campaign cash flowed in \u2014 she raised $6.6 million in the past two years, an astronomical sum for a freshman member of the House. Frisch campaigned on a largely conservative platform and against what he dubbed Boebert\u2019s \u201cantics\u201d and \u201cangertainment.\u201d The former city council member in the posh town of Aspen hoped to entice disaffected Republicans and build a bi-partisan political coalition. He rarely mentioned he was a Democrat on the campaign trail and backed removing Democrat Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the House, saying he wanted to lower the partisan temperature in Washington. It was an indirect dig at Boebert that resonated with voters in a highly rural district that, though conservative, have often backed pragmatists. \u201cWe have shown the country that extremists politicians can be defeated, loud voices are not invincible, and shouting will not solve problems,\u201d said Frisch.",

    "EPA orders Ohio power plant to stop dumping toxic coal ash": [
        "By MATTHEW DALYNovember 18, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 In a major action to address toxic wastewater from coal-fired power plants, the Environmental Protection Agency on Friday ordered an Ohio utility to stop dumping dangerous coal ash into unlined storage ponds and speed cleanup of the site. The order to the Gen. James Gavin Power Plant in southern Ohio marks the first time the EPA has formally denied a utility\u2019s request to continue disposing toxic coal ash after a deadline to stop such disposal has passed. The Gavin plant, located along the Ohio River in Cheshire, Ohio, is one of the largest coal-fired electricity plants in the U.S. At least five other plants, most in the Midwest, face similar action by the EPA under a crackdown proposed in January. \u201cFor too long, communities already disproportionately impacted by high levels of pollution have been burdened by improper coal ash disposal,\u201d EPA Administrator Michael Regan said Friday. \u201cToday\u2019s action reaffirms that surface impoundments or landfills cannot be closed with coal ash in contact with groundwater.\u2033 The action is intended to ensure that local water resources are safe while protecting the public health and ensuring a reliable electricity supply, Regan said. Coal ash, the substance that remains when coal is burned to generate electricity, contains a toxic mix of mercury, cadmium, arsenic and other heavy metals. It can pollute waterways, poison wildlife and cause respiratory illness among those living near massive ponds where the waste is stored. The EPA order directs the power plant to stop placing coal ash and other waste streams into an on-site storage pond no later than 135 days after publication in the Federal Register, expected next week. As a practical matter, the plant may have have to pause or even cease operations next year in order to comply with the order. A spokesperson for the plant\u2019s owner, Lightstone Generation LLC, could not be reached for comment. The company is a joint venture between private-equity firms ArcLight Capital Partners and Blackstone Group. EPA said Friday that its decision recognizes the importance of maintaining grid reliability. The order establishes a process for Gavin to seek additional time, if needed, to address demonstrated grid reliability issues.  EPA said it is working with a regional grid operator to prevent unscheduled outages and protect reliability of the grid. Under rules established by the grid operator, PJM Interconnection, Gavin must request a planned outage at least 30 days in advance, EPA said. The order finalized Friday follows through on a proposal issued in January that implements a 2015 rule aimed at reducing groundwater pollution from coal-fired power plants. The Trump administration weakened the Obama-era rule in 2020, allowing utilities to use cheaper technologies and take longer to comply with guidelines that were less stringent than the initial rule. The action on coal ash was among dozens of public health and environmental mandates that were weakened, rolled back or eliminated under former President Donald Trump. U.S. coal plants produce about 100 million tons (90 million metric tons) annually of ash and other waste. The EPA has proposed denial of requests for extensions of coal ash permits by several other power plants, including the Clifty Creek power plant in Madison, Indiana and the Ottumwa Generating Station in Ottumwa, Iowa. The H.L. Spurlock plant in Maysville, Kentucky, is required to fix groundwater monitoring as a condition for continued operation of its coal ash pond, the EPA said. Lisa Evans, a senior attorney for the environmental group Earthjustice, called the Gavin plant \u201ca super-polluter\u2033 and said EPA\u2019s action was overdue. \u201cIn this case, the violations are very obvious and very severe,\u2033 she said, adding that the plant\u2019s previous and current operators \u201chave continued their reckless and illegal disposal of toxic coal ash and contaminated groundwater. Now they will be forced to clean it up.\u2033  A report issued this month by Earthjustice and the Environmental Integrity Project said 91% of U.S. coal-fired plants have ash landfills or waste ponds that are leaking arsenic, lead, mercury and other metals into groundwater at dangerous levels, often threatening streams, rivers and drinking water aquifers. Some power companies are illegally manipulating data and monitoring systems to avoid cleanup requirements and have proposed inadequate cleanup strategies that will not restore groundwater quality, the report said.",

    "Feds: Oath Keepers sought \u2018violent overthrow\u2019 of government": [
        "By LINDSAY WHITEHURSTNovember 18, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 For weeks leading up to Jan. 6, 2021, Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes and four associates discussed using violence to overturn the results of the 2020 election, and when rioters started storming the Capitol they saw an opportunity to do it, a federal prosecutor told jurors Friday as the seditious conspiracy case wound toward a close.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Kathryn Rakoczy said in her closing argument to jurors after nearly two months of testimony in the high-stakes case that Rhodes\u2019 own words show he was preparing to lead a rebellion to keep Democrat Joe Biden out of the White House. Rhodes and his co-defendants repeatedly called for \u201cviolent overthrow\u201d of the U.S. government and sprang into action on Jan. 6, she said.  \u201cOur democracy is fragile. It cannot exist without respect for the rule of law, and it will not survive if people dissatisfied with the results of an election can use force and violence to change the outcome,\u201d Rakoczy said.  The closing arguments began in Washington federal court after the final pieces of evidence were presented in the trial alleging Rhodes and his band of antigovernment extremists plotted for weeks to interrupt the peaceful transfer of power from Republican Donald Trump to Biden.  The jury is expected to begin deliberations Monday, after closing statements from the defense conclude.  Rhodes\u2019 attorney sought to downplay his violent rhetoric in the run-up to Jan. 6, describing it as \u201cventing\u201d and insisting there was no agreement or conspiracy. Defense attorney James Lee Bright said Rhodes\u2019 language was focused on persuading Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act over what he saw as a stolen election.  Rhodes \u201cwasn\u2019t hiding his opinions, he wasn\u2019t hiding any plans,\u201d Bright told jurors. He was \u201cas open as daylight with every plan on what he was asking President Trump to do.\u201d  Evidence presented by prosecutors shows Rhodes and his co-defendants discussing the prospect of violence and the need to keep Biden out of the White House in the weeks leading up to Jan. 6, before stashing a cache of weapons referred to as a \u201cquick reaction force\u201d at a Virginia hotel across the Potomac River. On Jan. 6, Oath Keepers wearing helmets and other battle gear were seen pushing through the pro-Trump mob and into the Capitol. Rhodes remained outside, like \u201ca general surveying his troops on a battlefield,\u201d a prosecutor told jurors. After the attack, prosecutors say, Rhodes and other Oath Keepers celebrated with dinner at a local restaurant.  Defense attorneys have spent weeks hammering prosecutors\u2019 relative lack of evidence that the Oath Keepers had an explicit plan to attack the Capitol. Rhodes, who is from Texas, testified that he and his followers were only in Washington to provide security for right-wing figures including Roger Stone. Those Oath Keepers who did enter the Capitol went rogue and were \u201cstupid,\u201d he said.  Rhodes testified that the mountain of writings and text messages showing him rallying his band of extremists to prepare for violence and discussing the prospect of a \u201cbloody\u201d civil war ahead of Jan. 6 was only bombastic talk.  The prosecutor sought to rebut suggestions that Rhodes\u2019 rhetoric was simply bluster, urging jurors not to become \u201cnumb\u201d to messages weren\u2019t just \u201cranting and raving\u201d but instead \u201cdeadly serious.\u201d  \u201cThe way they have appointed themselves to be above the law is why they are here today,\u201d she said. \u201cThe sense of entitlement that led to frustration followed by rage and then violence \u2013 that is the story of this conspiracy.\u201d  Rhodes\u2019 lawyer said his client was back at a hotel room eating chicken wings and watching TV when the first rioters started storming the Capitol. He noted that the Oath Keepers never deployed their \u201cquick reaction force\u201d arsenal. \u201cYou\u2019re either the Keystone Cops of insurrectionists, or there is no insurrection,\u201d he told jurors, referring to the inept police officers of silent movies. Two other defendants testified in the case. Jessica Watkins, of Woodstock, Ohio, echoed that her actions that day were \u201creally stupid\u201d but maintained she was not part of a plan and was \u201cswept along\u201d with the mob, which she likened to a crowd gathered at a store for a sale on the popular shopping day known as Black Friday.  Defendant Thomas Caldwell, a Navy veteran from Virginia, downplayed a chilling piece of evidence: messages he sent trying to get a boat to ferry weapons from Virginia across the Potomac into Washington. He testified that he was never serious about his queries, though he struggled to explain other messages referencing violence on Jan. 6.  Two other defendants, Kelly Meggs and Kenneth Harrelson, both from Florida, did not testify. Meggs\u2019 attorney, Stanley Woodward, argued that there were thousands of people involved, and his client was not among the first people to enter the Capitol. Attorneys for the other defendants are expected to making closing arguments Monday. The group is the first among hundreds of people arrested in the deadly Capitol riot to stand trial on seditious conspiracy, a rare Civil War-era charge that calls for up to 20 years behind bars upon conviction. The stakes are high for the Justice Department, which last secured such a conviction at trial nearly 30 years ago and intends to try two more groups on the charge later this year. ___ Follow the AP\u2019s full coverage of the Capitol riot at https://www.apnews.com/capitol-siege.",

    "Judge says Georgia law allows Saturday voting for runoff": [
        "By KATE BRUMBACK and JEFF AMYNovember 18, 2022 GMT",
        " ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 A judge on Friday said Georgia law allows counties to offer early voting on the Saturday after Thanksgiving, which is the only possibility for Saturday voting before next month\u2019s Senate runoff election between Democratic Sen Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker. Warnock\u2019s campaign, along with the Democratic Party of Georgia and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, filed a lawsuit this week arguing that early voting should be allowed that day. They were challenging guidance by Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger that said it would be illegal to hold early voting on Saturday, Nov. 26, the day after a state holiday. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Thomas Cox on Friday issued an order saying Georgia law \u201cdoes not specifically prohibit counties from conducting advanced voting on Saturday, November 26, 2022, for a runoff election.\u201d He also prohibited the state from interfering in efforts to hold early voting that day or preventing any votes cast that day from being counted. \u201cWe disagree with the Court\u2019s order and look forward to a prompt appeal,\u201d Raffensperger\u2019s office said in an emailed statement. During a hearing earlier Friday, Uzoma Nkwonta, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, noted that last week both Raffensperger and one of his top deputies said on national television that early voting would be allowed that day. Then, Nkwonta said, the secretary of state issued guidance to counties a few days later saying it wouldn\u2019t be allowed because the law doesn\u2019t permit early voting the day after a state holiday. Thanksgiving and the following Friday are both state holidays. Nkwonta argued at the hearing that the state holiday restriction applies only to primary and general elections, not to runoffs. Provisions in the law that directs the state\u2019s 159 counties to open early in-person voting \u201cas soon as possible\u201d for a runoff, and no later than Monday, Nov. 28, reinforce the idea that counties can choose to offer early voting that Saturday, he said. State lawmakers intentionally created a distinction between primary and general elections on one hand and runoff elections on the other, Nkwonta said. That makes sense, he reasoned, because of the condensed time period before a runoff. \u201cThe legislature has provided voting opportunities that the state now seeks to withdraw,\u201d Nkwonta said. \u201cThat is unlawful.\u201d Charlene McGowan, a lawyer for the state, rejected assertions that Raffensperger was cherry-picking parts of the law. \u201cThis is a legal issue, it\u2019s not a policy one,\u201d she told the judge. \u201cThe issue is what does Georgia law require?\u201d McGowan argued that there are two types of elections in Georgia: primary elections and general elections. Runoffs are a continuation of one of those two types of election and, therefore, do not have different rules for allowing early voting after a holiday. Cox disagreed saying that a runoff \u201cis not merely a continuation of a primary or (general) election but is in fact it\u2019s own distinct event.\u201d Warnock and Walker were forced into a Dec. 6 runoff because neither won a majority in the midterm election this month.  Under Georgia\u2019s 2021 election law, there will be only four weeks between the general election and the runoff \u2014 with Thanksgiving in the middle. Many Georgians will be offered only five weekdays of early in-person voting beginning Nov. 28.  The lawsuit says the state\u2019s interpretation of the law would hurt Warnock in particular because Democrats tend to push early voting more than Republicans. It\u2019s not clear how many counties will scramble to offer Saturday voting. Counties are supposed to give public notice seven days before starting early voting. But Cox prohibited the state from interfering in counties\u2019 efforts to provide early voting that day due to any failure to provide the required notice.  Counties may also not be interested in offering Saturday voting, or may not have enough time to organize and schedule poll workers. As of Thursday, only nine predominantly Democratic urban counties planned Sunday voting, according to Associated Press reporting. Six are in the Atlanta area and the others are home to some of the state\u2019s other bigger cities. Some counties plan to offer early voting Tuesday and Wednesday, while others have said they couldn\u2019t mobilize in time to offer voting on those pre-Thanksgiving days.",

    "Saudi prince\u2019s new title key to dodging lawsuit over killing": [
        "By ELLEN KNICKMEYER and MATTHEW LEENovember 18, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 It raised eyebrows six weeks ago when Saudi Arabia\u2019s aged king, Salman, named his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as prime minister. The kingdom\u2019s laws designate the king as prime minister. King Salman had to declare a temporary exception to loan out the title, and at the same time made clear he retains key duties. But that move reaped dividends Thursday, when the Biden administration declared that Prince Mohammed\u2019s standing as prime minister shielded him from a U.S. lawsuit over what the U.S. intelligence community says was his role in Saudi officials\u2019 2018 killing of a U.S.-based journalist. A judge will now decide whether Prince Mohammed has immunity. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby insisted Friday that the administration\u2019s declaration of immunity for Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince was purely a \u201clegal determination\u201d that \u201chas absolutely nothing to do with the merits of the case itself.\u201d  Many experts in international law agreed with the administration \u2014 but only because of the king\u2019s late September title boost for the crown prince, ahead of a scheduled U.S. decision. \u201cIt would have been just as remarkable for the United States to deny MBS\u2019s head-of-state immunity after his appointment as Prime Minister as it would have been for the United States to recognize MBS\u2019s head-of-state immunity before his appointment,\u201d William S. Dodge, a professor at the University of California-Davis School of Law, wrote, using the prince\u2019s initials. State Department spokesman Vedant Patel gave examples Friday of past instances of the U.S. recognizing immunity for heads of government or state \u2014 Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and Narendra Modi of India, both in allegations of rights abuses. The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Washington by the fianc\u00e9e of slain journalist Jamal Khashoggi and by a D.C.-based rights group he founded. It accuses the crown prince and about 20 aides, officers and others of plotting and carrying out Khashoggi\u2019s slaying at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.  The killing, condemned by Biden on the campaign trial in 2019 as \u201cflat-out murder\u201d that must have consequences for Saudi rulers, is at the core of a rift between strategic partners, the United States and Saudi Arabia. Before and immediately after taking office, Biden vowed to take a stand on Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, as part of a presidency that would be based on rights and values. But Biden has since offered a fist bump and other conciliatory gestures in hopes \u2014 disappointed so far \u2014 of persuading the crown prince to pump more oil for world markets. Biden\u2019s administration argues that Saudi Arabia is too important to the global economy and to regional security to allow the United States to walk away from the decades-old partnership. But rights advocates, some senior Democratic lawmakers, and Khashoggi\u2019s newspaper, The Washington Post, on Friday condemned the administration\u2019s move. \u201cJamal died again today,\u201d Khashoggi\u2019s fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, tweeted. Fred Ryan, publisher of the Post, called it a \u201ccynical, calculated effort\u201d to manipulate the law and shield Prince Mohammed. Khashoggi wrote columns for the Post that in his last months criticized the crown prince\u2019s rights abuses. \u201cBy going along with this scheme, President Biden is turning his back on fundamental principles of press freedom and equality,\u201d Ryan wrote. Cengiz and Khashoggi\u2019s rights group, Democracy for the Arab World Now, or DAWN, had argued that the crown prince\u2019s late September title change was no more than a maneuver to escape U.S. courts, without legal standing or any change in authority or duties.  Saudi Arabia has not commented publicly on the administration\u2019s decision. Spokespeople with the Saudi Embassy and Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Friday. Saudi Arabia blames what it says were \u201crogue\u201d officials for Khashoggi\u2019s killing. It says the prince played no part. Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy, as opposed to a constitutional one like the United Kingdom, where a prime minister rather than king or queen governs. \u201cPretty pathetic,\u201d Sarah Leah Whitson, head of Khashoggi\u2019s rights group, said Friday of the title change.  \u201cIf anything, it just demonstrated how afraid Mohammed bin Salman was and has been of our lawsuit and actual accountability and actual discovery of his crimes,\u201d Whitson said. The Biden administration appeared to dismiss her group\u2019s argument that Prince Mohammed\u2019s recent title change ran counter to Saudi Arabia\u2019s governing law and should be disregarded.  King Salman has continued making appointments and presiding over meetings of his council since the title change.  But Prince Mohammed for years has been a key decision-maker and actor in the kingdom, including representing the king abroad.  Some Western news outlets had presented the temporary transfer of the prime minister title as King Salman \u2014 who is in his late 80s \u2014 devolving responsibility to Prince Mohammed, who is 37. A federal judge had given the U.S. until Thursday to offer an opinion, or not, on the claim by the crown prince that his standing shields him from U.S. courts. Rights advocates had hoped up to the moment of filing that the administration would stay silent, offering no opinion on Prince Mohammed\u2019s immunity either way. Sovereign immunity, a concept rooted in international law, holds that states and their officials are protected from some legal proceedings in other foreign states\u2019 courts.  Prior criminal and civil cases brought against foreign governments and leaders in which the U.S. has not intervened have generally involved countries with which the U.S. has no diplomatic relations or does not recognize their heads of state or government as legitimate. Cases brought against Iran and North Korea seeking damages for deaths or injuries to American citizens are two prominent examples of instances where the executive branch has not weighed in with an opinion about sovereign immunity. By contrast, the United States has full diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia. The State Department stressed Thursday that honoring the principle for other governments\u2019 leaders helps ensure that courts in other countries don\u2019t seek to haul U.S. presidents before them to answer to lawsuits there. Kirby, the National Security Council spokesman, said the U.S. decision had \u201cabsolutely nothing\u201d to do with \u201ctense\u201d U.S.-Saudi relations over Saudi-led oil production cuts, and other matters. Biden has been \u201cvery, very vocal\u201d about the \u201cbrutal, barbaric murder of Khashoggi,\u201d Kirby said. But some of Biden\u2019s fellow Democrats in Congress expressed disappointment at the administration\u2019s move. \u201cIs the Administration casting aside its confidence in its own intelligence community\u2019s judgment?\u201d Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, said in a statement. \u201cIf the friends and family of Khashoggi are denied a path to accountability in the American court system, where in the world can they go?\u201d Whitson, the official for Khashoggi\u2019s rights group, said the lawsuit would continue against the others named in the lawsuit. __ Associated Press writer Aamer Madhani contributed to this report.",

    "Biden says inflation help is coming but \u2018will take time\u2019": [
        "By CHRIS MEGERIAN and AAMER MADHANINovember 18, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden cautioned on Friday that \u201cit\u2019s going to take time\u201d for inflation to recede, but he offered fresh assurance that legislation he signed earlier this year will soon help limit costs for health care and energy.  He made the remarks while meeting with business and labor leaders in his first public event since returning from an around-the-world trip to Egypt, Cambodia and Indonesia. Biden has been encouraged by the Democrats\u2019 stronger-than-expected performance in the midterm elections, but he could be entering a perilous stretch when it comes to the economy.  The White House has emphasized a strong jobs market to try to allay concerns about a potential recession. However, the Federal Reserve continues to try to slow economic growth by raising interest rates to battle inflation.  It\u2019s a delicate situation that Biden will be navigating amid turnover in his economic team. Cecilia Rouse, a labor economist who became the first Black woman to lead the Council of Economic Advisers, will leave the administration in the spring, according to a White House official. She is expected to return to Princeton University, where she has been on academic leave. The official was not authorized to publicly discuss personnel changes and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The pending departure comes as Biden\u2019s term reaches its halfway point, often a time of transition for a presidential administration.  Bloomberg was first to report Rouse\u2019s planned departure, and it said Brian Deese, director of Biden\u2019s National Economic Council, plans to depart next year.  The official said there was no timeline for Deese to leave. Another key member of Biden\u2019s economic team, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, has said she wants to remain in the administration.  \u201cI plan to stay,\u201d she told MSNBC last month. \u201cI am very excited about the president\u2019s economic program. There is a lot to implement.\u201d There was additional turnover in the Biden administration earlier this month when Chris Magnus, head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, was forced out of his job. Immigration authorities have struggled to manage the flow of migrants toward the United States\u2019 border with Mexico, a frequent point of criticism from Republicans. At Friday\u2019s event, Biden said his trip overseas showed \u201cthe United States is as well or better positioned as any nation in the world to lead the world on the economy in the years ahead.\u201d He conceded that \u201cit\u2019s going to take time to get inflation back down to normal levels.\u201d However, he said that \u201cin six short weeks, Americans are going to start to feel the effects of the Inflation Reduction Act,\u201d the massive legislation that he signed in August. He said the law\u2019s provision to limit to $35 the cost of insulin for seniors on Medicare begins on Jan. 1.  Thousands of dollars in tax credits also will become available to help make homes more energy efficient with new windows, solar panels or heat pumps.  \u201cWe\u2019re talking about real money . . . and it\u2019s just going to start kicking in now,\u201d Biden said.  The focus on the economy could serve as a contrast to Republicans\u2019 agenda in the House, where they just won a narrow majority and have planned sweeping investigations into the president, his family and his administration.  ___ AP writer Fatima Hussein contributed to this report.",

    "US moves to shield Saudi crown prince in journalist killing": [
        "By ELLEN KNICKMEYER and MATTHEW LEENovember 18, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Biden administration says Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s high office should shield him from a lawsuit over his role in the killing of a U.S.-based journalist, making a turnaround from Joe Biden\u2019s passionate campaign trail denunciations of the prince over the brutal slaying. The administration spoke out in support of a claim of legal immunity from Prince Mohammed \u2014 Saudi Arabia\u2019s de facto ruler, who also recently took the title of prime minister \u2014 against a suit brought by the fianc\u00e9e of slain Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi and by the rights group Khashoggi founded, Democracy for the Arab World Now. \u201cJamal died again today,\u201d Khashoggi\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Hatice Cengiz, tweeted after the U.S. filing late Thursday in her lawsuit. The U.S. government\u2019s finding of immunity for the Prince Mohammed, sometimes known as MBS, is non-binding, and a judge will ultimately decide whether to grant immunity. But it angered rights activists and risked blowback from Democratic lawmakers. The U.S move came as Saudi Arabia has stepped up imprisonment and other retaliation against peaceful critics at home and abroad and has cut oil production, a move seen as undercutting efforts by the U.S. and its allies to punish Russia for its war against Ukraine. The State Department on Thursday called the administration\u2019s call to shield the Saudi crown prince from U.S. courts in Khashoggi\u2019s 2018 killing \u201cpurely a legal determination.\u201d It cited what it called longstanding precedent. Despite its recommendation to the court, the State Department said in its filing late Thursday that it \u201ctakes no view on the merits of the present suit and reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of the heinous murder of Jamal Khashoggi.\u201d Saudi officials killed Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. They are believed to have dismembered him, although his remains have never been found. The U.S. intelligence community concluded Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince had approved the killing of the widely known and respected journalist, who had written critically of Prince Mohammed\u2019s harsh ways of silencing of those he considered rivals or critics. The Biden administration statement Thursday noted visa restrictions and other penalties that it had meted out to lower-ranking Saudi officials in the death.  \u201cFrom the earliest days of this Administration,\u202fthe United States Government has expressed its grave concerns regarding Saudi agents\u2019 responsibility for Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s murder,\u201d the State Department said. Its statement did not mention the crown prince\u2019s own alleged role. Biden as a Democratic presidential candidate vowed to make a \u201cpariah\u201d out of Saudi rulers over the 2018 killing of Khashoggi.  \u201cI think it was a flat-out murder,\u201d Biden said in a 2019 CNN town hall, as a candidate. \u201cAnd I think we should have nailed it as that. I publicly said at the time we should treat it that way and there should be consequences relating to how we deal with those \u2014 that power.\u201d But Biden as president has sought to ease tensions with the kingdom, including bumping fists with Prince Mohammed on a July trip to the kingdom, as the U.S. works to persuade Saudi Arabia to undo a series of cuts in oil production. Khashoggi\u2019s fianc\u00e9e and DAWN sued the crown prince, his top aides and others in Washington federal court over their alleged roles in Khashoggi\u2019s killing. Saudi Arabia says the prince had no direct role in the slaying. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond ironic that President Biden has singlehandedly assured MBS can escape accountability when it was President Biden who promised the American people he would do everything to hold him accountable,\u201d the head of DAWN, Sarah Leah Whitson, said in a statement, using the prince\u2019s acronym. Biden in February 2021 had ruled out the U.S. government imposing punishment on Prince Mohammed himself in the killing of Khashoggi, a resident of the Washington area. Biden, speaking after he authorized release of a declassified version of the intelligence community\u2019s findings on Prince Mohammed\u2019s role in the killing, argued at the time there was no precedent for the U.S. to move against the leader of a strategic partner. The U.S. military long has safeguarded Saudi Arabia from external enemies, in exchange for Saudi Arabia keeping global oil markets afloat. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to read the Biden administration\u2019s move today as anything more than a capitulation to Saudi pressure tactics, including slashing oil output to twist our arms to recognize MBS\u2019s fake immunity ploy,\u201d Whitson said. A federal judge in Washington had given the U.S. government until midnight Thursday to express an opinion on the claim by the crown prince\u2019s lawyers that Prince Mohammed\u2019s high official standing renders him legally immune in the case.  The Biden administration also had the option of not stating an opinion either way. Sovereign immunity, a concept rooted in international law, holds that states and their officials are protected from some legal proceedings in other foreign states\u2019 domestic courts. Upholding the concept of \u201csovereign immunity\u201d helps ensure that American leaders in turn don\u2019t have to worry about being hauled into foreign courts to face lawsuits in other countries, the State Department said. Human rights advocates had argued that the Biden administration would embolden Prince Mohammed and other authoritarian leaders around the world in more rights abuses if it supported the crown prince\u2019s claim that his high office shielded him from prosecution. Prince Mohammed serves as Saudi Arabia\u2019s de facto ruler in the stead of his aged father, King Salman. The Saudi king in September also temporarily transferred his title of prime minister \u2014 a title normally held by the Saudi monarch \u2014 to Prince Mohammed. Critics called it a bid to strengthen Mohammed\u2019s immunity claim. \u2014\u2014 Eric Tucker and Aamer Madhani contributed.",

        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A federal judge on Friday sentenced an Ohio man who claimed he was only \u201cfollowing presidential orders\u201d from Donald Trump when he stormed the U.S. Capitol to 3 years in prison. Dustin Byron Thompson was convicted in April by a jury that took less than three hours to reject his novel defense for obstructing Congress from certifying Joe Biden\u2019s presidential victory.  The jury also found Thompson guilty of all five of the other charges in his indictment, including stealing a coat rack from an office inside the Capitol during the Jan. 6, 2021 riot. Thompson apologized and said he was ashamed of his actions.  U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton told Thompson he could not understand how someone who had a college degree could \u201cgo down the rabbit hole\u201d and believe \u201cso much in a lie.\u201d The judge said Thompson had to pay a price for a \u201cserious crime\u201d that undermined the \u201cintegrity and existence of this country.\u201d The maximum sentence for the obstruction count was 20 years imprisonment. The government had recommended a sentence of 70 months while the defense sought a year and a day in prison. Thompson testified at trial that he joined the mob\u2019s attack and stole the coat rack and a bottle of bourbon. He said he regretted his \u201cdisgraceful\u201d behavior. But he also said he believed Trump\u2019s false claim that the election was stolen and was trying to stand up for him. Thompson was charged and convicted on six counts: obstructing Congress\u2019 joint session to certify the Electoral College vote, theft of government property, entering or remaining in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly or disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly or disruptive conduct in a Capitol building and parading, demonstrating or picketing in a Capitol building. More than 770 people have been charged with federal crimes arising from the riot. Over 250 of them have pleaded guilty, mostly to misdemeanors. Thompson was the fifth person to be tried on riot-related charges.",

    "Top progressive Jayapal passes on Dem leadership race": [
        "By FARNOUSH AMIRINovember 18, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Pramila Jayapal, the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, took herself out of the running Friday for Democratic leadership in the next Congress by announcing a bid for a second term to lead one of the largest groups of lawmakers in the party.  In a letter to her progressive colleagues, Jayapal, of Washington, noted the series of achievements the caucus had during her tenure as chair. She also acknowledged the challenges House Democrats face as they become the minority party in January.  Jayapal\u2019s tenure began when President Joe Biden \u2014 whom she has dubbed the most progressive president in history \u2014 came to office. \u201cThe next two years are going to be important in a very different way than the last two years were,\u201d Jayapal said in an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday. \u201cThe last two years were about governing, about pushing, about getting the most that we could get.\u201d  \u201cThe next two years are going to be about being an opposition party, which I am extremely good at because I fought on immigrant rights and I came in 2016 when (Donald) Trump was elected,\u201d she added.  Jayapal, who became the first Indian American woman elected to the House, spent the last few months exploring a run for a senior leadership post after the midterm elections, as Speaker Nancy Pelosi and much of her team were expected to step down and make way for new leaders. That happened Thursday when the 82-year-old Pelosi took to the House floor to announce that she will be stepping aside after leading the party for nearly two decades. Democratic Reps. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and Pete Aguilar of California are seen as likely to replace Pelosi, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Whip Jim Clyburn as the new leadership team.  Jeffries, a member of the Progressive Caucus, could make history as the nation\u2019s first Black speaker of the House if Democrats regain control of Congress in the future.  Jayapal said that it was only in the last few weeks that she made her own decision not to pursue a leadership post.  In October, Jayapal retracted a letter from the caucus that had urged Biden to engage in direct diplomatic talks with Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. The letter generated intense blowback, exposed Democratic divisions and left some questioning if Jayapal is prepared for leadership.  She denied the letter as being one of the factors for her decision.  Instead, Jayapal said it was the work the caucus had done over the past two years that inspired her to run for chair again, this time to lead the largest number of progressive members in the group\u2019s history, including the more than a dozen new members of the group elected to Congress this month.  If Jefferies announces his run for minority leader when Congress comes back after the Thanksgiving break, Jayapal said, there are a number of things she would ask of him and his leadership team before pledging the progressive group\u2019s support.  \u201cI do want to sit down with him,\u201d Jayapal said, \u201cjust to make sure we\u2019re talking through the role of the CPC as it relates to the leader.\u201d",

    "Pelosi, dominant figure for the ages, leaves lasting imprint": [
        "By CALVIN WOODWARD and NANCY BENACNovember 18, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 There are two searing scenes of Nancy Pelosi confronting the violent extremism that spilled into the open late in her storied political career. In one, she\u2019s uncharacteristically shaken in a TV interview as she recounts the brutal attack on her husband. In the other, the House speaker rips open a package of beef jerky with her teeth during the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection, while on the phone with Mike Pence, firmly instructing the Republican vice president how to stay safe from the mob that came for them both. \u201cDon\u2019t let anybody know where you are,\u201d she said. That Pelosi, composed and in command at a time of chaos, tart but parochial-school proper at every turn, is the one whom lawmakers have obeyed, tangled with, respected and feared for two decades. She is the most powerful woman in American politics and one of the nation\u2019s most consequential legislative leaders \u2014 through times of war, financial turmoil, a pandemic and an assault on democracy. Now, at 82, in the face of political loss and personal trauma, she decided her era was ending. Pelosi stood in the well of a rapt House on Thursday and announced she would not seek a Democratic leadership position in the Congress that convenes in January, when Republicans take control of the chamber. Pelosi, who will remain a member of the House, took her time revealing the news, looking back over an improbable career and recalling her first visit to the Capitol at age 6 with her congressman father. \u201cNever would I have thought that I would go from homemaker to House speaker,\u201d she allowed. On her future, she told reporters: \u201cI like to dance, I like to sing. There\u2019s a life out there, right?\u201d Polarizing and combative, Pelosi nevertheless forged compromises with Republicans on historic legislation.  Across the policy spectrum, whether you liked the results or not, she delivered votes that touched ordinary lives in many ways. Among them: how millions get health care, the state of the roads, the lightened burden of student debt, the minimum wage, progress on climate change that took over a decade to bear fruit. Even former Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich, a self-described \u201cpartisan conservative who thinks that most of her positions are insane,\u201d said Pelosi had a \u201cremarkable\u201d run. This, from a fellow \u201ctroublemaker with a gavel,\u201d as she called herself. He flamed out; she didn\u2019t. \u201cTotally dominant,\u201d Gingrich said of her in an interview. \u201cShe\u2019s clearly one of the strongest speakers in history. She has shown enormous perseverance and discipline.\u201d ___ FEW SURVIVE Those qualities are essential if you don\u2019t want to be run out of town, as was a succession of modern Republican speakers, back to Gingrich. It\u2019s one thing to herd sheep. It\u2019s another thing altogether to herd Democrats and all their messy factions. Pelosi dealt with conservative Blue Dog Democrats, the liberal women of the Squad, the Out of Iraq Caucus \u2014 not to mention old-guard legislators who treated their committees like fiefdoms. Many of the above, at one point or another, earned her look of icy disapproval, well practiced and not always reserved just for the other side. \u201cPolitics is tough,\u201d she said in 2015, \u201cbut intraparty? Oh, brother.\u201d Squad member Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, not always Pelosi\u2019s biggest fan, spoke Thursday of how Pelosi had \u201cserved as a beacon of hope\u201d to her and her family when they migrated from Somalia. Omar, at times the subject of \u201csend her back\u201d chants during Donald Trump\u2019s rallies, recalled that Pelosi had invited her to join her on a 2019 trip to Africa \u201cto represent how far we have come as a country.\u201d Princeton political scientist Frances Lee said there\u2019s no doubt Pelosi was a \u201ctruly great legislative leader, among a handful truly in command. She\u2019s really had her party in the House of Representatives in hand. The difficulty of managing them should not be underrated. It didn\u2019t always look pretty but she held the party together.\u201d Pelosi prevailed \u2014 for nearly 20 years as House Democratic leader including nearly eight as speaker in two separate stints \u2014 with hard-nosed sentiments like these: \u201cWhoever votes against the speaker will pay a price.\u201d \u2014 to Democrats who resisted her push for a select committee on climate change early in her speakership. \u201cNobody\u2019s walking out of here saying anything, if they want to keep an intact neck.\u201d \u2014 to negotiators trying to work out a 2007 House-Senate compromise to restrain pork, according to the notes of John A. Lawrence, her then-chief of staff and author of a new insider book on her speakership, \u201cArc of Power.\u201d Sometimes, she could snap her lawmakers into line without a word. A flick of her hand was all it took to silence Democrats who cheered when the House first passed articles of impeachment against Trump. It was an occasion for sobriety and Pelosi was a stickler for institutional decorum. But not always. She ripped up her copy of Trump\u2019s 2020 State of the Union speech, on the dais behind him, on camera. The theatrical protest at one of American democracy\u2019s prime rituals raised questions about whether Pelosi, in that moment, had become what she despised in Trump. Afterward, she said she had extended her \u201chand of friendship\u201d to him when he arrived but he did not take it. \u201cHe looked a little sedated,\u201d she added. As she read quickly through her copy of the speech while Trump delivered it, she stewed over the lines and decided to take action. \u201cHe has shredded the truth in his speech, shredded the Constitution in his conduct \u2014 I shredded the address,\u201d she said crisply. \u201cThank you all very much.\u201d ___ THE VILLAINIZATION  In 2007, Republican President George W. Bush opened his speech as the \u201cfirst president to begin his State of the Union with these words: Madam Speaker.\u201d He grinned, she beamed, an ovation followed.  Although she maintained a genial relationship with the Bush family \u2014 especially the elder George Bush \u2014 Republican campaigns seized on her as the perfect foil early on and never let go. She was pilloried as \u201cDarth Nancy\u201d in the 2006 campaign and the villainization got much uglier, complete with gun imagery, as the years passed and politics became more toxic.  \u201cShe was, she is, the personification of the San Francisco liberal,\u201d Lawrence said in an interview. \u201cIt was made to order for them.\u201d  But \u201cwith her there was a viciousness. The fact that she fit that bill so perfectly \u2014 a smart, attractive, effective woman ... they knew they could caricature and stigmatize things about her, her appearance and style, in a way that was a very effective dog whistle of misogyny.\u201d Republicans often did it simply to raise money, and it worked. Then they used her in ads to attack Democratic congressional candidates. Some of those worked, too, At least publicly, she would never attribute the attacks to the fact she\u2019s a woman, Lawrence said. \u201cShe would say, \u2018They did it because I\u2019m effective.\u2019\u201d Then \u201cpretend to flick dust\u201d off her immaculate jacket.  \u201cDarth Nancy\u201d was a quaint, faraway insult by the time the pro-Trump mob came looking for her that Jan. 6. Their sign at the Capitol said \u201cPelosi is Satan.\u201d Rifling through her desk in the abandoned speaker\u2019s office, they found a pair of boxing gloves. Pink ones. ___ THE DO-LOTS CONGRESS Over the years, Pelosi honed the art of aiming high, then disappointing one faction of her party or another without losing her core of support. Rare is the major achievement that was as far left as the party\u2019s left wing wanted it to be.  But many are the major achievements. She settled for an \u201cObamacare\u201d bill that did not give everyone the option of government health insurance, but did, over time, fundamentally expand access to health care. As financial institutions and large segments of the economy sank into the Great Recession, with the 2008 election looming, she settled for a Bush-era stimulus package that essentially bailed out Wall Street \u2014 when liberal Occupy Wall Street activists had very different ideas. She delivered Democratic votes to help even some Trump initiatives get over the line, like early COVID-19 pandemic relief, before swinging behind President Joe Biden on some of the most far-reaching legislation since Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Great Society push in the 1960s. And Bono, who worked with Pelosi over the years on combating AIDS, said in a statement to the AP after a performance Thursday night in Scotland: \u201cWhen the story of the end of AIDS is written, Nancy Pelosi\u2019s name will stand out in boldface.\u201d \u201cI am honored to have learned so much from her grit and grace, and to call her a friend,\u201d he added. For all the accolades, Pelosi crushed a multitude of toes along the way. \u201cHer instincts are to find a path and if you happen to be standing in the hole, she\u2019s going to treat you like a running back,\u201d said political scientist Cal Jillson at Southern Methodist University. \u201cIf she can go through you, fine. If not, you\u2019re headed to the medicine tent.\u201d Some of the toes squashed by Pelosi belong to Jane Harman, a fellow Californian who long ran in the same circles as the speaker. She returned to Congress in 2001 after a two-year gap, armed with a written promise from Democratic leaders that she could reclaim her seniority and become chair of the sought-after Intelligence Committee if the party took control of the chamber. When Democrats did so in 2007 and Pelosi became speaker, she bumped Harman from the committee, citing term limits that had not always been evenly applied. Harman believes the real reason was that Pelosi was under pressure from liberals not to give the job to someone who had supported the war in Iraq. \u201cI think, looking back, that she was under pressure from the left not to promote somebody who had voted for the war.\u201d Still, Harman, who left Congress in 2011 to lead the Wilson Center think tank, allows that Pelosi has \u201ca very good political radar and she has kept the caucus together.\u201d When Pelosi entered Congress in 1987, men chaired all the House committees and no women had led one since the 1970s, by the reckoning of House historians. In the 1970s, the most popular committee chair appointment for women in the House was to lead the Select Committee on the House Beauty Shop before that panel vanished at the end of that decade. Under Pelosi, women took over more panels and gained weightier assignments while the speaker worked to advance authority for minorities in her ranks as well as their numbers. \u201cShe led in a way that did set the stage for other women and open the doors for their potential,\u201d said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Woman and Politics, at Rutgers University. \u201cThings have moved. And she is a big part of that.\u201d  ___ THE PELOSI CEILING Because of the speaker\u2019s longevity, however, many other up-and-comers in the party besides Harman have discovered they could only rise so far before hitting the Pelosi ceiling. The top job simply hadn\u2019t been available.  Pelosi faced none of the questions about sharpness or stamina that dog Biden, 80 on Sunday. She still races around Congress, in high heels, at a pace that people half her age can find hard to match.  But even before the elections, concern had grown in the ranks about the crowd of older Democratic leaders from the same era still in charge. \u201cNo brewing rebellion,\u201d said Lee at Princeton, but \u201ca sense that maybe it is time.\u201d Leon Panetta, former CIA and Defense chief and chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, had nothing but praise for Pelosi\u2019s leadership and skill but said she \u201cprobably could have spent more time building a stronger bench in terms of leadership in the House and trying to make sure that others could follow in her path. That becomes a question mark now as to just exactly who\u2019s going to be able to replace her.\u201d Panetta met her in the 1980s when he was a congressman from California and she was getting started as a Democratic fund-raiser extraordinaire after her family had moved to that state. She had already learned lessons about transactional politics as the politically engaged daughter of Thomas J. D\u2019Alesandro Jr., a three-term Baltimore mayor and five-term member of Congress from Maryland. Her prowess in persuading people to open their wallets on behalf of Democratic candidates was one of the keys to her success. Harman calls those dollars crucial to the \u201cbig tent\u201d that Pelosi erected for her caucus and to her ability to hold sway over it \u2014 \u201ca $1.25 billion tent.\u201d Michigan Rep. Fred Upton, a Republican who was in the same freshman class with Pelosi and is retiring from Congress, said of her: \u201cThis is why the Democrats had more money than God. She was magic, and I don\u2019t think she lost a vote.\u201d Gingrich tacks on other elements of her power: \u201cHer fundraising, her ability to inspire intense loyalty, her willingness to punish people who don\u2019t do what she wants.\u201d \u201cAs a professional, you have to have great respect for her ability to acquire and wield power and her ability to build what was an effective machine,\u201d he said.  Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement that despite their many disagreements, \u201cI have seen firsthand the depth and intensity of her commitment to public service. There is no question that the impact of Speaker Pelosi\u2019s consequential and path-breaking career will long endure.\u201d  In Pelosi\u2019s reign, nothing was left to chance \u2014 even her clothing was curated to send a message: She paired a black dress worn during the Trump impeachments with a gold pin depicting the mace of the House, a symbol of her power. When she swooshed out the doors of the White House after one particularly pointed encounter with Trump, her sunglasses and burnt-orange winter coat were quickly the stuff of social media memes.  On Thursday, for the big reveal of her plans, Pelosi wore suffragette white and her mace brooch.  Pelosi told reporters the attack on her husband, Paul, also 82, last month made her inclined to stay in leadership, so as not to give extremists the satisfaction of seeing her leave. She might have hung in, she indicated, if Democrats had won a majority. The attacker, who police say had come looking for the speaker, fractured her husband\u2019s skull with a hammer. Pelosi said she is working through \u201csurvivor\u2019s guilt.\u201d Could there be a third-generation Pelosi headed to Congress after the speaker and her father? It\u2019s long been thought that Nancy\u2019s daughter, Christine, would be at the front of the line for the congressional seat whenever Pelosi decided to retire. In her time, Pelosi went beyond domestic politics to stake a claim to congressional influence in foreign policy on behalf of the House as an institution, pointing her gavel outward in a way speakers had rarely done.  Well beyond her annual Mother\u2019s Day visits to women in combat overseas, Pelosi traveled to foreign leaders with a mission to project U.S. stability, particularly during the unpredictable Trump years but also before and after. She traveled secretly to Kiev early in the Russia-Ukraine war and caused some grief in the Biden administration with her diplomatically dicey visit to Taiwan this year.  Pelosi had a history of standing up to China. In her first foreign trip after being elected to Congress in 1987, she joined other U.S. lawmakers in 1991 in unfurling a banner at Tiananmen Square after Chinese authorities crushed pro-democracy demonstrations there in 1989. Her recent Taiwan visit was another slap at Beijing. For all her clout in government, Pelosi was an unpopular figure in the country overall. In a Pew Research Center poll conducted in late June and early July, only about a third of respondents had a favorable opinion of Pelosi, while 6 in 10 were unfavorable toward her. Most Democrats and Democratic leaners \u2014 about 6 in 10 \u2014 were thumbs up about her, though she lagged Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, both rated favorably by three-quarters of Democrats. About 9 in 10 Republicans viewed her unfavorably. Through it all, she went at practically everything as if it had a best-before date. After all, she would say, \u201cPower is perishable.\u201d Washington is \u201cthe perishable city.\u201d  ___ AP Congressional Correspondent Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.",

    "Lengthy vote counts frustrate, but don\u2019t signal problems": [
        "By CHRISTINA A. CASSIDY and JULIE CARR SMYTHNovember 18, 2022 GMT",
        " ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Four days after Election Day, with a bitter, high-profile race for Arizona governor still up in the air, Ohio\u2019s secretary of state broke an unspoken protocol among top election officials. \u201cDear Arizona, need some advice on how to run an election the right way?\u201d Frank LaRose, a Republican, chided his counterparts on Twitter. \u201cYour process is obviously not working.\u201d Though not as fast as most would like, the process actually was working as designed and as it has for years in a state where the vast majority of voters cast mailed ballots. What\u2019s different is that many of the races were so close that winners couldn\u2019t be quickly determined, a frustration that has become more common as Arizona has evolved into one of the nation\u2019s most hotly contested political battlegrounds. The governor\u2019s race eventually was called for the Democrat, Katie Hobbs, four days after LaRose sent his social media blast \u2014 with about 17,000 votes separating the candidates out of more than 2.5 million cast.  Arizona isn\u2019t the only state where votes were still being counted a week later. Even in Ohio, where the margins for Republican candidates were wide enough for all top races to be called on election night, counties were still tallying late-arriving mailed, military and overseas ballots nearly a week after Election Day. One state legislative race had yet to be called. In California, where voting by mail has greatly expanded, four U.S. House races had remained uncalled. The state\u2019s vote counting process has been in the spotlight this week because California\u2019s congressional districts had become pivotal for determining which party would control the House. The call for Republicans finally came late Wednesday after enough results had been released in a Los Angeles County seat. Lengthy vote counts can frustrate candidates and their supporters, but they don\u2019t indicate anything is wrong with the voting or the tallying of ballots. Counting even in races where a winner can be called on election night doesn\u2019t stop until every eligible ballot has been verified and counted, and that takes time -- sometimes a few days or even a week or more. Many states allow mail ballots to be counted as long as they are postmarked by Election Day and received within a set period of time. Those ballots then have to be verified and counted. Also in many states, voters who return mail ballots with technical problems have a certain number of days for them to fixed. In Georgia\u2019s Bartow County, the last ballots were counted late Monday afternoon, about 30 minutes before local officials certified the election. \u201cA lot of the important work we do for elections happens after Election Day,\u201d said Joseph Kirk, the county\u2019s election supervisor.  A week after the election, officials across the country were still counting ballots cast by military personnel or Americans who are overseas, as well as ballots that were cast provisionally when there were questions about eligibility. Arizona and Nevada still had to count 2% of their ballots as of Tuesday, and in Oregon it was 4%. California at the time still had to count 31% of its estimated outstanding ballots. Voters in each of those states are automatically mailed a ballot each election. It\u2019s the same in Colorado, where election officials say the state\u2019s vote-by-mail system, developed by both major parties, is working as it has in the past. Attention to the vote count process comes up only when there\u2019s a high-profile race that is exceptionally close, as there is this year with Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert\u2019s reelection bid in the 3rd Congressional District \u2014 still uncalled on Thursday. Some have seized on the ballot counting process in Arizona\u2019s Maricopa County, by far the state\u2019s most populous, to question the integrity of the election. Supporters of Kari Lake, the Republican candidate for governor, have said it\u2019s suspicious that it took days to count ballots. Lake has criticized Election Day\u2019s transformation into what she calls \u201cElection Week\u201d and has not conceded the race. Former President Donald Trump said in a social media post, \u201cI assume everyone is watching Arizona as the great Kari Lake\u2019s easy election win is slowly, yet systematically, being drained away from her, and from the American people.\u201d Some criticism is based on a misunderstanding of the process. Vote totals change as more ballots are counted, and that can mean one candidate pulls ahead of the other. Ohio Republican LaRose said in an interview after his tweet that he favors his state\u2019s process, in which the state releases results only on election night and then a second time after all ballots have been processed. He said releasing results incrementally, as Arizona does, can promote \u201cwild conspiracy theories\u201d and puts pressure on election workers. Contributing to the challenges in Maricopa County was a massive influx of mail ballots dropped off on Election Day. Ahead of the election, conservative activists who falsely believe the 2020 election was stolen from Trump had urged supporters not to vote until the last minute or to turn in their mail ballots as late as possible as a way of preventing \u2014 in their view \u2014 Democrats from rigging the election. There is no evidence of any widespread fraud or manipulation of voting machines in the 2020 election or this year\u2019s. Jen Easterly, director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said there are no signs that voting systems changed or deleted votes, or were compromised in any way. Mail ballots take longer to count because of the numerous verification steps built into the process to guard against potential fraud. These include matching ballots to the voter registration database and verifying signature or identification information. \u201cYou can\u2019t discount the impact that having to process mail ballots has had,\u201d said Jennifer Morrell, a former local election official in Utah and Colorado who now advises federal and state officials on election administration and security. \u201cAll those things take time to do it right.\u201d Utah is the only Republican-led state to mail ballots to all active voters. The vote by-mail system has been implemented gradually over the past decade, and voters are overwhelmingly supportive, even though counting in close races can take weeks. In 2020, 92% of the state\u2019s electorate used mail ballots. This year, Republicans won Utah statewide races by convincing margins, but the outcome in one congressional district has in some years been decided by a percentage point or less. That meant the winner was not determined for several weeks, and yet the wait did not generate complaints from members of either party, said former U.S. Rep. Ben McAdams, who lost reelection to the seat in 2020. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate when people really are selective in their complaints about elections,\u201d he said, comparing voting by mail in Utah to other states. \u201cNationally, it seems like it is disingenuous. You have to wonder what their motives are when they find problems in races where they lose, but see no problems in the races that they win.\u201d Utah, a state that voted for Trump twice, still had 8% of its estimated ballots yet to count as of Tuesday. Simply because the counting continues long after Election Day is no reason for alarm, said Ryan Cowley, Utah\u2019s director of elections. He said tens of thousands voters waited until Election Day to submit their mail ballots. \u201cThe way I view it as you can either have it really fast or you can have it really accurate, but you can\u2019t really have both,\u201d Cowley said. ___ Smyth reported from Columbus, Ohio.

    "US agent, suspected smuggler killed off Puerto Rico coast": [
        "By MICHAEL BALSAMO and JOSHUA GOODMANNovember 18, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent and a suspected smuggler died during a shootout Thursday off the Puerto Rico coast, authorities said. Two other U.S. officers were injured. CBP\u2019s Air and Marine Operations unit was on routine patrol around 8 a.m. Thursday when the shots were fired about 12 miles (19 kilometers) off the coast from Cabo Rojo, a major drug smuggling corridor for cocaine coming out of South America known as the Mona Passage, the agency said. It lies between Puerto Rico\u2019s western coastline and the Dominican Republic. Three CBP Marine Interdiction Agents exchanged gunfire with two people who were aboard the suspected smuggling ship, officials said. All three agents were shot and airlifted to local hospitals in Puerto Rico.  One of the agents was later pronounced dead. The agent\u2019s identity was not immediately released and the condition of the other two agents was not immediately clear.  One of the people aboard the suspected smuggling ship was also killed, officials said. The second person on that vessel was arrested.  After the shooting, another U.S. marine interdiction crew intercepted another boat nearby, finding firearms and other contraband onboard, Customs and Border Protection said. The two people on that ship were also arrested.  The FBI is leading the investigation into the shooting.  Speaking to reporters in Puerto Rico, CBP spokesman Jeffrey Qui\u00f1ones said it was too early to know where the vessel originated from, the nationality of its two passengers and whether it was carrying narcotics or servicing another suspected drug vessel in the Caribbean. Typically, drug cartels recruit poor fishermen from Colombia and Venezuela to transport large amounts of cocaine northward to the Dominican Republic where it is broken down into smaller bales and transferred at sea to waiting vessels manned by better-paid, sometimes well-armed Puerto Rican drug runners.  Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in testimony before a Senate committee that an Air and Marine Operations agent was killed and several other agents were \u201cgravely wounded.\u201d  \u201cThese are brave members of our Air and Marine Operations within U.S. Customs and Border Protection,\u201d Mayorkas said. \u201cSo the difficulty of this job cannot be compared to the difficulty that our frontline personnel face every day. Their bravery and selfless service should be recognized.\u201d Air and Marine Operations employs about 1,650 people and is one of the smaller units of CBP, the largest law enforcement agency in the United States that also includes the Border Patrol. It works to stop the illegal movement of people, drugs and other goods. The unit detected 218 \u201cconventional aircraft incursions\u201d on U.S. soil in the 2021 fiscal year, seized 1.1 million pounds of narcotics, $73.1 million in illicit currency, made more than 122,000 arrests and recued 518 people, according to CBP. ___ Goodman reported from Miami.

    "Pelosi\u2019s big decision: \u2018There\u2019s a life out there, right?\u2019": [
        "By LISA MASCARONovember 17, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the attack on her husband, Paul, by an intruder in their family home made her think about staying on as the House Democratic leader because she \u201ccouldn\u2019t give them that satisfaction\u201d of intimidating her out of politics. But Pelosi said Thursday she was ready to step aside and felt \u201cbalanced\u201d about her decision to make way for a new generation of leaders.  She\u2019s staying as the congresswoman of San Francisco but has no plans to endorse a successor or meddle with the new leaders. \u201cI have no intention of being the mother-in-law in the kitchen saying, \u2018My son doesn\u2019t like the stuffing that way,\u2019\u201d Pelosi said in a wide ranging interview with reporters at the Capitol. \u201cThey will have their vision, they will have their plan.\u201d As for the future direction of the House Democrats, she said: \u201cThat\u2019s up to them, I want it to be whatever they want it to be.\u201d Pelosi, who is 82, spoke to reporters in the \u201cThe Board of Education\u201d Room, a historic space once frequented after hours only by the men in Congress, after she announced her decision to step down after 20 years as the party leader. Her action followed the midterm elections t hat gave Republicans control of the House. First elected in 1987, when there were just 12 Democratic women in Congress, Pelosi said she chose to wear white to deliver her speech on the House floor Thursday in a nod to the suffragettes \u2014 noting a painting of the women with the 19th Amendment she had installed in the gilded meeting room alongside one of San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate bridge. Digging into a package of cookies \u2014 chocolate chip, of course \u2014 the speaker would not say exactly when she made her decision to step aside.  She keeps a close hold on her most important decisions, and even now, once it had spilled out in the open, said how she finally arrived at her choice was something she might have to think more about. It was known that she took two versions of her speech home with her for review Wednesday night. \u201cI, quite frankly, personally, have been ready to leave for a while,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause there are things I want to do. I like to dance, I like to sing. There\u2019s a life out there, right?\u201d Pelosi said that after 20 years, \u201cI don\u2019t feel sad about not having a leadership position. ...I feel balanced about it.\u201d She has said that the attack on Paul Pelosi, who suffered a fractured skull when an intruder broke into their home weeks before the election searching for her, had weighed on her decision.

And she plans to get to work reviewing the 2022 election results and preparing for the next big votes in 2024. Long seen as a powerful figure, one who controls and even micromanages many aspects of House leadership \u2014- from the way the bills are written to the timing of votes to the running of congressional campaigns \u2014 she said she expects to play no role guiding the next generation of leaders. \u201cThey have to bring their own fresh perspective, thinking entrepreneurially,\u201d she said. She won\u2019t be endorsing a successor ahead of party elections at the end of the month \u2014 \u201cI didn\u2019t think that was the right approach, to anoint somebody,\u201d she said. She said it\u2019s \u201creally important for people to have the legitimacy that they were chosen\u201d by their colleagues.  Her advice to those who follow her leadership: \u201cBe yourself.\u201d As for upcoming political battles, she questioned whether Republican Kevin McCarthy, a fellow Californian, would have the support needed to become speaker.  And she said she doesn\u2019t \u201ctake any responsibility\u201d for the political divisions in Congress, blaming it on Republican extremism: \u201cThey do not believe in governance.\u201d While Pelosi expressed some regret that Democrats were unable to make permanent an expanded child tax credit or paid family medical leave as they had considered at the start of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency, she believes her party will have some leverage in the new Congress because of the House Republicans\u2019 slim majority. \u201cThere has to be work for other people to do,\u201d she said. Pelosi said her husband of nearly 60 years continues to recover from the assault \u2014 the intruder struck him in the head with a hammer \u2014 but that the road ahead is long.  Sitting still, without too many people \u2014 limiting visits with the children and grandchildren \u2014 and avoiding recurring memories of the assault are key, she explained. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard,\u201d she said, acknowledging a form of \u201csurvivor\u2019s guilt\u201d since the attack was aimed at her and turned their home into a \u201ccrime scene.\u201d But the leader long reviled by Republicans as a San Francisco liberal announced she was off to do the most very un-California thing she does most workdays: \u201cI will now have a very nutritious hot dog for lunch.\u201d ",

    "Biden admin to ask high court to take up student debt plan": [
        "By COLLIN BINKLEYNovember 17, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Biden administration plans to ask the Supreme Court to reinstate the president\u2019s student debt cancellation plan, according to a Thursday legal filing warning that Americans will face financial strain if the plan remains stalled in court when loan payments are scheduled to restart in January. The Justice Department is fighting to keep Biden\u2019s plan alive after it was halted by two federal courts in recent weeks. The agency is asking for quick action to block both rulings and allow the plan to take effect even as it plays out in the nation\u2019s courts. In a legal filing Thursday, the administration announced plans to appeal one of those rulings, by a federal appeals court in St. Louis, to the nation\u2019s highest court. And it says it\u2019s prepared to appeal the other case if needed. The White House has said it will prevail, but even some supporters of the plan worry about its chances before a conservative Supreme Court that has scaled back Biden\u2019s authority in other ways, including in a June decision curbing the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s ability to limit power plan emissions. Biden\u2019s plan promises $10,000 in federal student debt forgiveness to those with incomes of less than $125,000, or households earning less than $250,000. Pell Grant recipients, who typically demonstrate more financial need, are eligible for an additional $10,000 in relief. Keeping the debt relief on hold would leave the government with an \u201cunnecessarily perilous choice,\u201d the administration argued in its filing. If it restarts student loan payments as planned on Jan. 1, millions of Americans will get billed for debt that was promised to be canceled. But if the government extends the payment pause, it will cost billions of dollars in lost revenue. It builds on arguments the administration made in other filings this week, warning that many Americans won\u2019t be able to pay their student debt bills in January if the cancellation plan remains halted.  For typical borrowers, monthly payments would be $200 to $300 higher than they would be if Biden\u2019s plan goes through, the Education Department said. The strain could lead to soaring default rates, which have increased by an average of twentyfold in the wake of other natural disasters. \u201cWe anticipate there could be an historically large increase in the amount of federal student loan delinquency and defaults as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d Education Undersecretary James Kvaal said in a Tuesday filing. \u201cThis could result in one of the harms that the one-time student loan debt relief program was intended to avoid.\u201d In its latest filing, the Justice Department asks an appeals court to lift a decision from U.S. District Court Judge Mark Pittman striking down Biden\u2019s plan. Pittman, who was appointed by former President Donald Trump and is based in Fort Worth, Texas, ruled last week that Biden\u2019s plan oversteps his presidential authority and usurps Congress\u2019 powers to make laws. It stemmed from a lawsuit brought by two borrowers who are not eligible for relief under the parameters of Biden\u2019s plan. The program was separately halted by a St. Louis court after six Republican-led states said it would harm financial institutions. Almost 26 million people already have applied for the relief, with 16 million approved, but the Education Department stopped accepting and processing applications last week after the plan was ruled illegal. Biden\u2019s plan has drawn a flurry of legal challenges, which have seen mixed results. Opponents of debt forgiveness have asked the Supreme Court to intervene at least twice after their cases failed in lower courts. The Supreme Court rejected both requests. The barrage of lawsuits has thrown Biden\u2019s plan, which was meant to deliver a major campaign promise, into jeopardy. It\u2019s now uncertain whether 40 million borrowers who were promised debt relief will have to start making payments on that debt in January. The biggest risk is for 18 million borrowers who were told their entire loan balance would be canceled. Even if payments restart, those borrowers might think they\u2019re in the clear and ignore the bills, the Education Department has warned. Borrowers who fall behind on payments can face heavy consequences, including damage to their credit scores and the withholding of wages and tax refunds. Advocates and some Democrats in Congress are pressuring Biden to extend the payment pause until all legal challenges are resolved, despite his previous assurance that the freeze would end after Dec. 31. In a Tuesday filing, the Education Department said it\u2019s \u201cexamining all available options.\u201d But it warned that extending the pause could cost the federal government \u201cseveral billion dollars a month in unrecovered loan revenue.\u201d The freeze already has cost the federal government more than $100 billion in revenue, according to a July report by the Government Accountability Office. Critics caution that another extension could worsen inflation and increase the risk of economic recession. In a separate action targeting student debt, the Education and Justice departments announced a new policy aiming to make it easier for borrowers to get student loans canceled in bankruptcy court. When borrowers in bankruptcy try to get their federal student loans canceled, lawyers for the government have typically moved to block it. Advocates have long complained that only a tiny fraction of borrowers in bankruptcy succeed in getting their student loans erased, and many lawyers won\u2019t even take those cases on. As a presidential candidate, Biden promised to fix the problem. The Justice Department on Thursday sent new guidance to its attorneys clarifying when they can support a borrower\u2019s request for student debt forgiveness. Judges still have the final say, but the department said its guidance will lead to \u201cfairer, more consistent results.\u201d Separately, a federal judge on Wednesday approved an Education Department settlement that will cancel $6 billion in student debt for borrowers who say they were defrauded by for-profit colleges. The deal was proposed in June but was delayed amid a challenge by several schools. A federal judge in San Francisco concluded that the settlement is fair. Advocates and the Biden administration applauded the approval, while a for-profit college industry group promised to appeal the decision. Under the settlement, the Education Department agreed to cancel loans for about 200,000 borrowers who went to one of more than 150 for-profit colleges and later applied for cancellation because of misconduct by their schools. It stems from a 2019 lawsuit accusing the Trump administration of intentionally stalling the loan relief program while it rewrote the rules. ___ The Associated Press education team receives support from the Carnegie Corporation of New York.

    "Difficulties again put Houston at center of Texas elections": [
        "By JUAN A. LOZANO and PAUL J. WEBERNovember 17, 2022 GMT",
        " HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 A Democrat who is the top official in Texas\u2019 largest county on Thursday acknowledged problems around Houston on Election Day that included paper ballot shortages and delayed openings of polling locations, but waved off an unfolding investigation by state police as political. Malfunctioning machines and long lines were also reported last week at some of the nearly 800 polling locations in Harris County, which is home to nearly 5 million people and has previously been at the center of clashes in Texas over elections. Some voting rights groups have expressed concern the investigation could be used by the GOP to justify additional voting restrictions. State election officials have said they heard of no widespread voting problems in Texas, where Republicans resoundingly won every statewide office and turnout was lower than in the 2018 midterms.  But Republican Gov. Greg Abbott this week said \u201cwidespread problems\u201d in Harris County \u2014 which Democrats comfortably carried in statewide races \u2014 warrant investigation. That was followed by the the local district attorney, Democrat Kim Ogg, asking the Texas Rangers to look into \u201calleged irregularities\u201d that she said could include criminal conduct, although her office has not publicly said what specific allegations warrant investigating. Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, a Democrat who narrowly won reelection as the county\u2019s chief executive against a Republican challenger, said she will ask local election department to improve. But she said difficulties at polling sites were not intentional and accused critics of stoking conspiracies.  \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that all this happens in the largest county in Texas, when clearly the folks that are peddling this didn\u2019t like the outcome of the elections in this county,\u201d she said.  Clifford Tatum, the county\u2019s elections administrator, told commissioners Tuesday that one polling location opened \u201ccritically late\u201d and that some ran out of paper, leading to election judges sending voters to other locations.  State Sen. Paul Bettencourt, a Houston Republican, said one polling location had trouble getting more paper after being given enough for only 600 ballots. He said the difficulties undermine public confidence in elections.  \u201cThis is not about election denial. These are real voter irregularities that have to be investigated,\u201d Bettencourt said.  The Texas Department of Public Safety, which includes the Texas Rangers, did not immediately return a message Thursday seeking comment about the investigation.  At Tuesday\u2019s commissioners court meeting, Tatum said an early assessment found the need for a revamped communication system between the precinct judge and the call center that handles requests for help. More than two dozen people spoke at the meeting, which at one point grew so heated that commissioners paused the proceedings.  \u201cWe have an elections plan. We followed the plan. Some of the plan didn\u2019t go as anticipated,\u201d Tatum said.  Delayed openings at a dozen polling places on Nov. 8 resulted in a judge extending voting by one hour in the nation\u2019s third-most populous county. But the Texas Supreme Court later stayed that order, resulting in provisional ballots cast during that time being put aside.  The smaller Bell County, which Republicans carried, also extended voting by one hour because of technical problems. County officials said no one challenged the more than 300 ballots cast during that time.  Democrat Rodney Ellis, a former state senator and now a Harris County commissioner, acknowledged the county should have had more election resources but said officials were adjusting to new rules passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature. Those included requirements for paper voting systems, which had bipartisan support.  Harris County is no stranger to frustration and anger over voting. In March, the county\u2019s previous election administrator appointed by Democrats, Isabel Longoria, resigned after issues in the March primary that included about 10,000 mail ballots that weren\u2019t counted the day of the election and a lack of poll workers. Late-returning vote counts in Harris County have long frustrated election watchers in Texas, including when local Republican officials were in charge of the process. The county\u2019s efforts to expand voting during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 also spurred Republicans to impose new restrictions that took effect this year, including a ban on drive-thru voting and 24-hour polling locations.  __ Weber reported from Austin, Texas.  __ Follow the AP\u2019s election coverage of the 2022 elections at https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections.",

    "GOP eyes new priorities for House, starting with Biden probe": [
        "By KEVIN FREKING and FARNOUSH AMIRINovember 17, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Republican Party\u2019s capture of the House majority, though narrow, will soon transform the agenda in Washington, empowering GOP lawmakers to pursue conservative goals, vigorously challenge the policies of Democratic President Joe Biden \u2014 and plunge into Washington investigations with their new subpoena powers. Come next year, Republicans have made clear, the Democratic-led Jan. 6 investigative committee will be no more. Instead, public probes into the president\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, will begin. And GOP priorities including border security, parents\u2019 rights and major IRS cuts will be on fast tracks to the House floor. It\u2019s a familiar whiplash, reminiscent of what took place after midterm contests in 2010 and 2018 that also ended one-party control of Washington \u2014 the first time to the Republicans\u2019 benefit, the second to the Democrats\u2019. This time, however, the Republicans\u2019 weaker-than-expected showing in last week\u2019s election will complicate plans to aggressively take Biden on with actual legislation. Speaker-in-waiting Kevin McCarthy will have few votes to spare as he steers the House agenda, little room to maneuver if members of his conference \u2014 particularly the hard-right Freedom Caucus \u2014 withhold their support. And few of the House GOP\u2019s goals, even if passed, are likely to have much of a chance in the closely divided but Democratic-led Senate. But after two years on the receiving end of Jan. 6 and Donald Trump investigations, Republicans have made clear a top priority for their own majority is to investigate and then investigate some more \u2014 Democrats this time. They are preparing a wide range of probes of Democrats, from Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings to the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, illegal immigration on the U.S.-Mexico border and billions of dollars in COVID spending they say was stolen or spent frivolously. \u201cIt\u2019s really about getting answers to questions that people all across this country have been asking for the last two years, and for various reasons, the administration refuses to be candid,\u201d said Rep. Steve Scalise, who is about to become House majority leader, said an interview before the election. Investigating the Biden family will be the first order of business, top Republicans indicated Thursday at a news conference just hours after clinching the House majority. Rep. James Comer, incoming chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said there are \u201ctroubling questions\u201d about the business dealings of Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter and one of the president\u2019s brothers, James Biden, that require deeper investigation. In fact, Republican lawmakers and their staff have been analyzing messages and financial transactions found on a laptop that belonged to Hunter Biden for the past year. They have discussed issuing congressional subpoenas to foreign entities that did business with him, and they recently brought on James Mandolfo, a former federal prosecutor, to assist with the investigation as general counsel for the Oversight Committee. Hunter Biden\u2019s taxes and foreign business work are already under federal investigation, with a grand jury in Delaware hearing testimony in recent months. While he never held a position on the presidential campaign or in the White House, his membership on the board of a Ukrainian energy company and his efforts to strike deals in China have long raised questions about whether he traded on his father\u2019s public service, including reported references in his emails to the \u201cbig guy.\u201d Joe Biden has said he\u2019s never spoken to his son about his foreign business. And there are no indications that the federal investigation involves the president in any way. Rep. Jim Jordan, the Ohio Republican who will lead the Judiciary Committee, said he intends to look into what he contends is an overly close relationship between the White House and the Justice Department \u201cThe only way you can hold people accountable and hopefully stop the behavior is to present it to the country,\u201d Jordan said. Both Jordan and Comer emphasized that they do not plan to investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s personal life. The White House has been preparing for months for possible investigations into Biden\u2019s family, though comment on anything related specifically to Hunter Biden would come from his lawyers, who did not immediately return a request on Thursday.  \u201cPresident Biden is not going to let these political attacks distract him from focusing on Americans\u2019 priorities, and we hope congressional Republicans will join us in tackling them instead of wasting time and resources on political revenge,\u201d Ian Sams, spokesperson for the White House counsel\u2019s office, said in a statement Thursday.  Even as the investigations unfold, Biden will have to find a way to work with McCarthy, a California Republican from a different generation known more for his political acumen than his ability to navigate legislative disputes. McCarthy is certain to find himself under intense pressure from his right flank to take on the White House, making it difficult to compromise. Even before the election, Republicans talked about exerting leverage over Biden to influence must-pass legislation to fund the government and authorize more federal debt. Some Republicans have suggested that a temporary government shutdown might be acceptable if it is necessary to force Democrats into accepting spending and other policy changes. \u201cIf it means that you have to stop the government from running its day-to-day operations so that we can actually fix the systemic and fundamental issues that are facing the American people, then so be it,\u201d said Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., on Fox Business. \u201cThat is what must be done.\u201d Scalise was careful on the topic, saying only that when the debt ceiling is reached, \u201cyou want to also work to address the problem that is causing us to max out the credit card.\u201d Republicans have been burned by brinkmanship before. They saw their standing in the polls plunge during a 16-day partial government shutdown in 2013, when they tried to use a spending bill to derail Obama\u2019s health care law and demand more budget concessions.  Whit Ayres, a GOP political consultant, said Republicans should focus on inflation, crime and border security in the majority, but fears they will overreach once again. \u201cIf past is prologue, the small House majority will govern from the right and we\u2019ll get engaged in these investigations and cut off Ukraine aid and try to ban abortion and do all these other things that will repel a majority of the country and put Democrats back in charge,\u201d Ayres said during a post-election forum at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.  ___ Associated Press writers Eric Tucker and Colleen Long contributed. ___ More on Donald Trump-related investigations: https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the elections at: https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections Check out https://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-elections to learn more about the issues and factors at play in the 2022 midterm elections.",

    "Griner has begun serving sentence in Russian penal colony": [
        "By ERIC TUCKERNovember 17, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 WNBA star Brittney Griner has begun serving her nine-year sentence for drug possession at a Russian penal colony, her lawyers and agent said Thursday. Griner was transferred to a penal colony in Mordovia, about 350 kilometers (210 miles) east of Moscow, after a Russian court last month rejected her appeal of her sentence. Her lawyers said they visited her earlier this week. \u201cBrittney is doing as well as could be expected and trying to stay strong as she adapts to a new environment,\u201d her lawyers said in a statement. The all-star center with the WNBA\u2019s Phoenix Mercury and two-time Olympic gold was detained in February when customs agents said they found vape canisters containing cannabis oil in her luggage at Moscow\u2019s Sheremetyevo Airport.  At her trial, Griner admitted to having the canisters in her luggage but testified she packed them inadvertently in her haste to make her flight and had no criminal intent. Her defense team presented written statements saying she had been prescribed cannabis to treat chronic pain. She was convicted in August and sentenced to nine years in prison. The Biden administration has been trying for months to negotiate the release of Griner and another American jailed in Russia, Michigan corporate security executive Paul Whelan, including through a possible prisoner swap with Moscow. Whelan was also sent to a penal colony in Mordovia after being convicted of espionage-related charges in 2020 and sentenced to 16 years in prison.  President Joe Biden told reporters last week that he hopes Russian President Vladimir Putin will be more willing to negotiate the release of Griner now that the U.S. midterm elections are over.  \u201cMy hope is that now that the election is over, that Mr. Putin will be able to discuss with us and be willing to talk more seriously about a prisoner exchange,\u201d Biden said. _____ Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP",

    "The AP Interview: Whitmer has \u2018no interest in going to DC\u2019": [
        "By JOEY CAPPELLETTI and WILL WEISSERTNovember 17, 2022 GMT",
        " LANSING, Mich. (AP) \u2014 Fresh off a commanding reelection victory in one of the nation\u2019s premier swing states, Democratic Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer says she will remain focused on her post and not growing speculation she could mount a future presidential run. In an interview with The Associated Press just over a week after winning a second term, Whitmer insisted she\u2019s \u201cnever had interest in going to D.C.\u201d and said she\u2019ll \u201cbe here for four more years.\u201d Whitmer didn\u2019t explicitly rule out running for president at some point in the future. She\u2019s also planning to travel to Washington in coming weeks to discuss her state\u2019s priorities. But the governor also said of trying to tamp down questions about whether she will mount a 2024 bid, \u201cIt\u2019s just a practical decision. I just won reelection. This is the job that I want.\u201d  \u201cMy whole focus is on the state of Michigan,\u201d Whitmer said Thursday.  A rising star in her party, the 51-year-old Whitmer has proven she can win tough races in one of the states that\u2019s been among the most decisive in deciding the presidency since 2016. Whitmer has been frequently mentioned as a future White House candidate, especially if President Joe Biden opts not to seek a second term. The governor said she\u2019d been approached in the past about running for Congress, or other federal offices, but said \u201canyone who\u2019s familiar with my career\u201d knows that \u201cI\u2019ve never been interested in going to DC. I love state government.\u201d Biden turns 80 on Sunday and has said he plans to run for reelection, though he has not yet formally announced a bid. Former President Donald Trump kicked off his third campaign for the White House with a speech at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida on Tuesday. Michigan has had \u201can outsized role in national elections and a voice and I think that\u2019s a good thing,\u2033 Whitmer said. She didn\u2019t watch Trump\u2019s announcement, and while Biden called her after the election, he simply congratulated her briefly and didn\u2019t touch on other topics, Whitmer said.  \u201cWhat I have said is, President Biden says he\u2019s going to run again. If he runs again, he\u2019s got my support,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d  Whitmer beat Republican Tudor Dixon, who had been endorsed by Trump, by a comfortable 11 points in last week\u2019s midterm election. Biden only won the state by about 3 percentage points two years ago.  Michigan voters also approved a referendum amending the state constitution to protect abortion rights after the Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. Democrats won majorities in both chambers of Michigan Legislature, giving the party full control of the body for the first time since 1984. Whitmer said she\u2019d work with state lawmakers to codify same-sex marriage rights statewide, and to fully rescind a 1931 law banning abortion that the midterm referendum sought to invalidate.  \u201cWe need to clean old laws off the books,\u201d she said, adding of the 1931 law, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have effect right now. But we don\u2019t want it to ever threaten to come back alive.\u201d  Whitmer called Michigan a safe haven for abortion and said patients have been coming to have the procedure from neighboring red states, including Ohio and Indiana. The governor said her state\u2019s defense of abortion rights could even attract new residents. That\u2019s especially important after Michigan lost a congressional seat this cycle because its population, while growing, did not keep pace with other booming places.  \u201cThere are a lot of businesses in states that are anti-choice \u2014 that have extreme laws on the books \u2014 that have vowed not to continue to invest there. They should move to Michigan,\u201d Whitmer said. \u201cAs should every young person who\u2019s graduated from school.\u201d Four people accused of conspiring to kidnap Whitmer in 2020 \u2014 when she became a national face of restrictions to slow the spread of the coronavirus \u2014 pleaded guilty or were convicted by a federal jury. Three others connected to the scheme were convicted in state court in October. Whitmer said the threat against her was downplayed relative to the arrest last summer of someone near Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s home and \u201cperhaps gender plays into that.\u201d  The suspect in that case \u201cturned himself in and it was covered as an assassination plot,\u201d she said. \u201cIn Michigan, we had over a dozen people, training for months, staking out my cottage, running drills on how to shoot me. And it was covered as a kidnapping plot.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s striking when you think about how many people were involved, how many months it occurred and all the lengths to which they took to execute their plan, and how big it was treated,\u201d Whitmer said. \u201cIs it \u2019cause I\u2019m a woman? Is it \u2019cause I\u2019m a Democrat? I don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s different and it\u2019s not right.\u201d During the midterm race, Dixon had championed Trump\u2019s lies about the 2020 presidential election being marred by widespread fraud that did not occur. Whitmer noted Thursday that Dixon called her to concede after the election, which was \u201cimportant\u201d and \u201cgracious of her.\u201d But she also said some Republican lawmakers had attended the same kind of rallies protesting the 2020 election results and COVID restrictions that those involved in her kidnapping plot did.  \u201cAnd yet I\u2019ve still got to get a budget done. I\u2019ve still got to negotiate,\u2033 she said. \u201cSo there\u2019s no room for my feelings to get involved.\u201d ___ Weissert reported from Washington.  ___ Joey Cappelletti is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 House investigators reported Thursday that a federal contractor that provided identity verification services for the Internal Revenue Service exaggerated the amount of money being lost to pandemic fraud in an apparent attempt to increase demand for its product and that it also overstated its capacity to provide services. The investigation of ID.me, which uses facial recognition to verify identities in some cases, was launched in April after critics of the software company said it could be a target of cyberthreats and presented privacy concerns. Other advocates were critical of a private company taking on what should be a core government task of verifying people\u2019s identities to receive benefits.  The report found that in 14 states that contracted with ID.me for identity verification services \u2014 including California, Texas, and Florida \u2014 wait times for ID.me video chats reached an average of more than four hours, though the firm claimed it answered calls in far less time, potentially delaying pandemic relief funds to millions of Americans.  The report said ID.me asserted that there were significantly higher levels of pandemic fraud compared to other assessments that were based on expert analysis in an apparent effort to boost interest in its services. The committees cited ID.me CEO Blake Hall\u2019s assertion that \u201cAmerica has lost more than $400 billion to fraudulent claims,\u201d though the Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Inspector General has identified $45.7 billion in potential unemployment fraud. Terry Neal, a spokesperson for ID.me, said \u201ccalling ID.me\u2019s estimate too high or baseless is premature and we welcome additional oversight on this important matter.\u201d Neal pointed to statements from officials in five states, including California, that credit ID.me with helping to prevent billions in fraud.  The report was commissioned by the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis and the Committee on Oversight and Reform after privacy advocates and lawmakers made calls for the company to be investigated.  \u201cIt is deeply disappointing that a company that received tens of millions in taxpayer dollars to help Americans obtain these benefits may have hurt their ability to access that critical relief,\u201d said Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., who chairs the coronavirus crisis subcommittee. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y, who chairs the oversight committee, said she was \u201cdeeply concerned about ID.me providing inaccurate information to federal agencies in order to be awarded millions of dollars in contracts.\u201d Neal said \u201cwe regret the long wait times that individuals endured while we fought to clear fraud out of the system. This situation was short-lived and temporary and caused by historic fraud.\u201d  \u201cExcluding specific episodes, wait times have generally been below 30 minutes as they are today,\u201d Neal said.  Earlier this year, the IRS announced it would suspend its use of ID.me\u2019s facial recognition technology to authenticate people who create online accounts after the practice was criticized by privacy advocates and lawmakers. ID.me\u2019s website states that the IRS, Social Security Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs and U.S. Patent and Trademark Office still maintain contracts with the federal government, and 14 states still maintain contracts with the firm.  Critics of the company, including the American Civil Liberties Union, have said outsourcing a core government function creates privacy problems.  \u201cID.me collects a rich stew of highly sensitive personal information about millions of Americans, including biometric data,\u201d the ACLU\u2019s website states, including government documents, social security numbers, military service records, and data from credit card bureaus and banks.

    "US House win by ex-combat pilot cements Republican control": [
        "By MICHAEL R. BLOODNovember 17, 2022 GMT",
        " LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Republican Rep. Mike Garcia, a former Navy fighter pilot, scored a U.S. House win in a strongly Democratic district Wednesday, handing the GOP control of the chamber and giving the party a rare reason to celebrate in a state dominated by Democrats.  The conservative Republican was reelected to a third term in a district that has a 12.5-point Democratic registration edge and was carried by then-presidential candidate Joe Biden by double digits in 2020. It was Garcia\u2019s third consecutive victory over Democrat Christy Smith, a former legislator.  Garcia was first elected in a special election in May 2020, then was reelected two years ago by just 333 votes. He faced an even tougher challenge this year, after his left-leaning district was redrawn and became more solidly Democratic.  With nearly 75% of the ballots counted, Garcia had 54.2%, to 45.8% for Smith. Even though his victory carried historic weight by putting Republicans in charge of the House \u201cthe mission remains the same,\u201d Garcia said in a statement, in which he promised to work to \u201cget our country back on track.\u201d Garcia, who flew over 30 combat missions during Operation Iraqi Freedom, is the sole GOP House member with a district anchored in heavily Democratic Los Angeles County.  It takes 218 seats to control the House. With the addition of the latest California results, Republicans have locked down 218 seats so far with Democrats claiming 211. In another key race in the state, Democratic Rep. Mike Levin beat back a tough challenge from Republican businessman Brian Maryott in a Southern California district that straddles Orange and San Diego counties. With nearly all the votes counted, Levin had 52.65%, to 47.4% for Maryott. Levin said he was eager to return to Washington to continue working on affordable health care, climate change and assistance for veterans. Biden traveled to the district in the election\u2019s closing days in hopes of giving Levin a boost. Garcia\u2019s win, which gave Republicans House control, came with a splash of political sass, arriving in a state so solidly Democratic that a Republican hasn\u2019t won a statewide race since 2006. It is also home to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco. California is known nationally as a liberal monolith, but pockets of conservative strength remain, mainly in the Southern California suburbs and rural and farming stretches. But even with the wins, Republicans will remain a small minority within the state\u2019s congressional delegation.  Of the state\u2019s 52 seats \u2014 the largest delegation in Congress \u2014 GOP candidates had captured just nine as of Wednesday. Counting continued in five districts, although one was a matchup between two Democrats.  Smith, a former legislator, had argued Garcia was out of step with district voters: He was endorsed by then-President Trump in 2020, then joined House Republicans who rejected electoral votes from Arizona and Pennsylvania and opposed Trump\u2019s impeachment after the Capitol insurrection. She also highlighted Garcia\u2019s opposition to abortion rights.  Garcia emphasized his military service and pointed to his vote supporting $2,000 stimulus checks as one example of his political independence. He\u2019s also stressed local issues, including concern over illegal marijuana cultivation. In California, the primary House battlegrounds are Orange County \u2014 a suburban expanse southeast of Los Angeles that was once a GOP stronghold but has become increasingly diverse and Democratic \u2014 and the Central Valley, an inland stretch sometimes called the nation\u2019s salad bowl for its agricultural production. The tightest remaining contest in the state emerged in the Central Valley, where Democrat Adam Gray seized a tissue-thin lead over Republican John Duarte for an open seat in District 13. Underscoring the closeness of the race, Gray\u2019s campaign formed a committee to begin raising money to finance a possible recount. The latest returns showed Gray leading by 600 votes, with nearly 85% of the ballots tabulated. In Orange County, Democratic Rep. Katie Porter was holding a nearly 3-point edge over Republican Scott Baugh in one of the nation\u2019s marquee races. Baugh had slashed her lead in half earlier this week, but Porter, a star of the party\u2019s progressive wing, rebounded. About 90% of the votes had been counted. In the Central Valley\u2019s 22nd District, where about two-thirds of the votes have been counted, Republican Rep. David Valadao, who voted to impeach then-President Donald Trump, had a 5.6-point margin over Democrat Rudy Salas. ___ Follow the AP\u2019s coverage of the 2022 midterm elections at https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections.

    "Republicans win back control of House with narrow majority": [
        "By WILL WEISSERT, SARA BURNETT and JILL COLVINNovember 17, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Republicans won control of the U.S. House on Wednesday, returning the party to power in Washington and giving conservatives leverage to blunt President Joe Biden\u2019s agenda and spur a flurry of investigations. But a threadbare majority will pose immediate challenges for GOP leaders and complicate the party\u2019s ability to govern. More than a week after Election Day, Republicans secured the 218th seat needed to flip the House from Democratic control. The full scope of the party\u2019s majority may not be clear for several more days \u2014 or weeks \u2014 as votes in competitive races are still being counted.  But they are on track to cobble together what could be the party\u2019s narrowest majority of the 21st century, rivaling 2001, when Republicans had just a nine-seat majority, 221-212 with two independents. That\u2019s far short of the sweeping victory the GOP predicted going into this year\u2019s midterm elections, when the party hoped to reset the agenda on Capitol Hill by capitalizing on economic challenges and Biden\u2019s lagging popularity. Instead, Democrats showed surprising resilience, holding on to moderate, suburban districts from Virginia to Minnesota and Kansas. The results could complicate House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy\u2019s plans to become speaker as some conservative members have questioned whether to back him or have imposed conditions for their support. McCarthy, R-Calif., celebrated his party having \u201cofficially flipped\u201d the House on Twitter on Wednesday night, writing, \u201cAmericans are ready for a new direction, and House Republicans are ready to deliver.\u201d Current House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., released a statement Wednesday night saying, \u201cIn the next Congress, House Democrats will continue to play a leading role in supporting President Biden\u2019s agenda \u2014 with strong leverage over a scant Republican majority.\u201d Biden congratulated McCarthy, saying he is \u201cready to work with House Republicans to deliver results for working families.\u201d  \u201cLast week\u2019s elections demonstrated the strength and resilience of American democracy. There was a strong rejection of election deniers, political violence, and intimidation,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cThere was an emphatic statement that, in America, the will of the people prevails.\u201d He added, that \u201cthe future is too promising to be trapped in political warfare.\u201d  The narrow margins have upended Republican politics and prompted finger-pointing about what went wrong. Some in the GOP have blamed Donald Trump for the worse-than-expected outcome. The former president, who announced his third White House bid Tuesday, lifted candidates during this year\u2019s Republican primaries who often questioned the results of the 2020 election or downplayed the mob attack on the U.S. Capitol last year. Many of those struggled to win during the general election.  Despite the GOP\u2019s underwhelming showing, the party will still have notable power. Republicans will take control of key committees, giving them the ability to shape legislation and launch probes of Biden, his family and his administration. There\u2019s particular interest in investigating the overseas business dealings of the president\u2019s son Hunter Biden. Some of the most conservative lawmakers have raised the prospect of impeaching Biden, though that will be much harder for the party to accomplish with a tight majority. Any legislation that emerges from the House could face steep odds in the Senate, where Democrats won the barest of majorities Saturday. Both parties are looking to a Dec. 6 Senate runoff in Georgia as a last chance to pad their ranks. With such a potentially slim House majority, there\u2019s also potential for legislative chaos. The dynamic essentially gives an individual member enormous sway over shaping what happens in the chamber. That could lead to particularly tricky circumstances for GOP leaders as they try to win support for must-pass measures that keep the government funded or raise the debt ceiling. The GOP\u2019s failure to notch more wins \u2014 they needed a net gain of five seats to take the majority \u2014 was especially surprising because the party went into the election benefiting from congressional maps that were redrawn by Republican legislatures. History was also on Republicans\u2019 side: The party that holds the White House had lost congressional seats during virtually every new president\u2019s first midterm of the modern era.  The new majority will usher in a new group of leaders in Washington. If elected to succeed Pelosi in the top post, McCarthy would lead what will likely be a rowdy conference of House Republicans, most of whom are aligned with Trump\u2019s bare-knuckle brand of politics. Many Republicans in the incoming Congress rejected the results of the 2020 presidential election, even though claims of widespread fraud were refuted by courts, elections officials and Trump\u2019s own attorney general. McCarthy won the nomination for House speaker on Tuesday, with a formal vote to come when the new Congress convenes in January. \u201cI\u2019m proud to announce the era of one-party Democrat rule in Washington is over,\u201d McCarthy said after winning the nomination. Republican candidates pledged on the campaign trail to cut taxes and tighten border security. GOP lawmakers also could withhold aid to Ukraine as it fights a war with Russia or use the threat of defaulting on the nation\u2019s debt as leverage to extract cuts from social spending and entitlements \u2014 though all such pursuits will be tougher given how small the GOP majority may end up being.  As a senator and then vice president, Biden spent a career crafting legislative compromises with Republicans. But as president, he was clear about what he viewed as the threats posed by the current Republican Party. Biden said the midterms show voters want Democrats and Republicans to find ways to cooperate and govern in a bipartisan manner, but also noted that Republicans didn\u2019t achieve the electoral surge they\u2019d been betting on and vowed, \u201cI\u2019m not going to change anything in any fundamental way.\u201d AP VoteCast, a broad survey of the national electorate, showed that high inflation and concerns about the fragility of democracy had heavily influenced voters. Half of voters said inflation factored significantly, with groceries, gasoline, housing, food and other costs that have shot up in the past year. Slightly fewer \u2014 44% \u2014 said the future of democracy was their primary consideration.  Counter to the GOP\u2019s expectations, Biden didn\u2019t entirely shoulder the blame for inflation, with close to half of voters saying the higher-than-usual prices were more because of factors outside his control. And despite the president bearing criticism from a pessimistic electorate, some of those voters backed Democratic candidates. Democrats also likely benefited from anger over the Supreme Court overturning the landmark Roe v. Wade decision cementing a woman\u2019s constitutional right to an abortion. Voters in Michigan voted to amend their state constitution to protect abortion rights while far more reliably Republican Kentucky rejected a constitutional amendment declaring no right to an abortion.  Overall, 7 in 10 voters said the high court\u2019s ruling overturning the 1973 decision enshrining abortion rights was an important factor in their midterm decisions. VoteCast also showed the reversal was broadly unpopular. About 6 in 10 say they are angry or dissatisfied by it. And roughly 6 in 10 say they favor a law guaranteeing access to legal abortion nationwide. ___ Learn more about the issues and factors at play in the midterms at https://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-elections.
