    "Will Herschel Walker's Abortion Controversy Hurt His Chances In Georgia?": [
        "By Nathaniel Rakich",
        " On Monday night, The Daily Beast reported that Herschel Walker, the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Georgia who has said he wants to ban abortion in all circumstances, had paid for his pregnant then-girlfriend to get an abortion in 2009. Walker is currently locked in a toss-up race with Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock for a seat that could decide control of the Senate. According to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s midterm forecast, Georgia is the most likely \u201ctipping-point\u201d state in the chamber \u2014 i.e., the state most likely to give Republicans or Democrats their majority. To give you a sense of how crucial it is: If Republicans win Georgia, we estimate they would have a 60-in-100 chance of winning the Senate. But if Democrats win the state, we estimate they\u2019d have an 89-in-100 chance of winning the chamber. The question is, how much will this controversy hurt Walker? Given the salaciousness of the story and the turmoil it has reportedly plunged his campaign into, it\u2019s tempting to think it might torpedo his chances. But that\u2019s hardly a guarantee. It is true that scandals tangibly affect candidates\u2019 chances of winning elections. I keep a database of scandals, and based on an analysis we did in 2018, we found that scandal-plagued incumbents did 9 percentage points worse in their next general election than they would otherwise be projected to do. That analysis included a variety of factors such as the candidate\u2019s previous margin of victory, the partisan lean of their district, generic-ballot polling, congressional approval ratings and the incumbent\u2019s congressional voting record. This finding led us to include whether or not a candidate faces a scandal as a variable in our midterm forecast. But this new revelation about Walker, who has denied the allegation, hasn\u2019t affected our forecast of the Georgia Senate race \u2014 at least not yet. That\u2019s because, for one, it doesn\u2019t meet our definition of a scandal. As our forecast defines it, a scandal is a credible accusation of objective criminal or ethical wrongdoing. While Walker\u2019s decision to pay for an abortion may have been hypocritical, it wasn\u2019t illegal. And if being hypocritical were enough to qualify as \u201cscandal-tarred,\u201d most politicians would be slapped with the label! Moreover, Walker has already been tagged with the scandal variable. Before and during his campaign, multiple previous scandals that meet our definition have come out. Walker\u2019s ex-wife accused him of threatening to kill her and was granted a protective order against him in 2005. He and a business partner were sued after failing to repay $625,000 in loans. Democrats have accused him of multiple campaign-finance violations. And in June, The Daily Beast reported that Walker had fathered three children he had not previously publicly acknowledged. But right now, the scandal variable barely impacts our forecast. Only 6 percent of the Deluxe forecast for Georgia Senate is based on the \u201cfundamentals,\u201d which include variables like scandals, Georgia\u2019s partisan lean, Warnock\u2019s incumbency and candidate fundraising. That\u2019s because Georgia is a very heavily polled state. And because we have so many polls and it is relatively close to Election Day, almost 60 percent of the forecast is based on survey data. And, of course, because this story is so recent, none of these polls account for Walker\u2019s abortion controversy. The bad press Walker is receiving may very well damage his standing with voters. The story has already spurred Walker\u2019s adult son Christian, a conservative social-media celebrity, to post critical tweets and videos about the candidate (including one in which he accused Walker of \u201cthreatening to kill us\u201d), which could keep Walker\u2019s unsavory personal life in the news. And he doesn\u2019t need to drop 9 points in the polls for this all to have an impact: According to our polling average of the race, Warnock is currently polling 2 points ahead of Walker, so even if the controversy doesn\u2019t hurt Walker, if it prevents him from gaining, that\u2019s a problem for the Republican. But on the other hand, there might not be many voters left to turn on Walker. Democrats have been airing ads for weeks reminding voters of Walker\u2019s past scandals. And Georgia is also a highly inelastic state, meaning it doesn\u2019t have a lot of swing voters. The National Republican Senatorial Committee has also said it will continue campaigning hard in Georgia. Many Republican and Republican-leaning voters in Georgia may feel that too much is at stake (i.e., control of the Senate) for this latest allegation to sway their vote. And, as we wrote in 2018, partisanship often trumps scandal. As always, we\u2019ll need to wait and see to know for sure how public opinion will change in response to this story. You can bet that we\u2019ll keep an extra close eye on Georgia polling for the next few weeks.",

    "Young Women\u2019s Views On Abortion Could Reshape The Midterms \u2014 And The Future Of Politics": [
        "By Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux",
        " In most midterm years, young voters tend to sit out the election. But 2022 could be a different kind of year. Turnout among 18- to 24-year-olds nearly doubled between the 2014 and 2018 midterm cycles. And the Supreme Court\u2019s June ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, which allows states to ban abortion for the first time in nearly five decades, suddenly put a spotlight on reproductive-health issues in many key elections.\u00a0 That could motivate the country\u2019s youngest voters \u2014 particularly women \u2014 to turn out in higher numbers. A large, recently released survey from the American Enterprise Institute\u2019s Survey Center on American Life shows that women between age 18 and 29 are especially likely to say that they\u2019re following news about abortion rights and access closely, and also that abortion is a critical issue for them.1 They\u2019re also more likely than young men to say that they\u2019re single-issue voters on abortion. But even though young women appear to be following politics more closely than they were before the Dobbs decision, it may be harder for Democrats to mobilize them now than it was even a month or two ago. Since the summer, abortion appears to have become a less prominent issue. Data from FiveThirtyEight\u2019s ongoing survey with Ipsos indicates that the share of Americans who say they have heard a lot about abortion in the news declined from August to September. And probably not unrelatedly, the share of Americans who say that abortion is one of their top three voting issues fell over that period as well, after peaking in July.\u00a0 Experts told me, though, that young women\u2019s reaction to living in a country with increasingly limited abortion access might take a while to take shape. Because fewer young voters usually turn out in midterm elections than in presidential elections, we may not feel the full impact of Dobbs among this group right away \u2014 particularly if Republicans succeed in restricting abortion in purple states like Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Virginia in upcoming legislative sessions. So this year\u2019s elections represent the first test of how young women are responding to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision and its aftermath \u2014 but not the last. Overall, women and men don\u2019t tend to think about abortion very differently \u2014 with the exception of the youngest generation of women. According to the Survey Center on American Life\u2019s American Perspectives Survey, nearly two-thirds (65 percent) of women between 18 and 29 think abortion should be legal in all or most cases, compared with 56 percent of men in the same age group and 52 percent of women 65 or over. The \u201cmost\u201d versus \u201call\u201d distinction is important because smaller shares tend to think that abortion should always be legal, with no limitations at all. But nearly half (48 percent) of 18- to 29-year-old women think abortion should be legal in all circumstances, compared with only 34 percent of both 18- to 29-year-old men and women 65 or over.  And young women have been paying attention to the news, as 14 states have successfully banned nearly all abortions over the past few months. Sixty-four percent of 18- to 29-year-old women say they\u2019re following news about abortion laws and restrictions very or somewhat closely \u2014 more than the share who say they\u2019re closely following news about gas prices and inflation (55 percent) or the 2022 midterm elections (25 percent). Young women are also much likelier than Americans as a whole to say that abortion is a critical issue for them personally, by 61 percent to 36 percent. That\u2019s true compared with other women, too: Only 34 percent of women 65 or over say that abortion is a critical issue for them.   The survey raises an intriguing possibility: that young women are likelier than their older counterparts to see the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, and the ensuing scramble to ban abortion in red states, as an attack on all women and not just a new set of restrictions on a medical procedure.\u00a0 The researchers asked a set of questions designed to gauge whether people think of themselves as part of a distinct group, where things that happen to other people like them matter for them as well. The findings suggest that women who believe that what happens to other women in the U.S. affects their lives too were far likelier than women who don\u2019t feel those connections to support abortion rights. Young women, meanwhile, were especially likely to feel a sense of linked fate with other women. About two-thirds (67 percent) of 18- to 29-year-old women said that everything or most things that happen to other women affected them too, compared with only 36 percent of women 65 or over.\u00a0 Young women seem to feel a more acute sense of discrimination in general. The vast majority (82 percent) of women 65 or over say that people don\u2019t treat them any differently because of their gender, whereas a much smaller majority (54 percent) of young women say the same. And 39 percent of young women say they think people treat them worse because of their gender. In other words, young women might be more likely than other demographic groups to feel that their own lives could be affected by abortion bans. Of course, women between 18 and 29 do make up a large share of women who get abortions, but the number of abortions performed in the U.S. every year is relatively small \u2014 suggesting that this sense of shared consequences could make this issue feel especially personal for young women, particularly in the short term. \u201cI could imagine a woman in her 20s looking at the cost of child care, the difficulty of being a parent, and thinking, \u2018Being able to get an abortion is something that really matters for women,\u2019\u201d said Kelly Dittmar, a political scientist at Rutgers University-Camden and the director of research at the Center for American Women and Politics. The bad news for Democrats is that there are signs that abortion may be fading as a priority, even for younger women. The American Perspectives Survey was conducted in August, but it\u2019s possible that if the same questions were asked today, enthusiasm around the issue of abortion might be lower. According to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s ongoing poll with Ipsos, shortly after the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, 29 percent of reproductive-aged women (ages 18-44) said that abortion was one of the top three issues facing the country \u2014 a substantially higher share than women 45 or over (18 percent), men between 18 and 44 (18 percent), and men 45 or over (12 percent).2 But since then, the issue has lost some steam. Even among reproductive-aged women, only 12 percent listed abortion as one of their highest priorities in the most recent wave of the survey, conducted Sept. 6-19.  That trend probably has something to do with Americans\u2019 hearing less about abortion in the news now than in the summer. Our survey with Ipsos found that the share of reproductive-aged women who said they\u2019d heard a lot about abortion in the news dropped from 70 percent just after the Dobbs ruling to 47 percent in September. So a lot could depend on whether stories about people who can\u2019t get abortions even in dire circumstances \u2014 like the 10-year-old rape survivor who had to travel from Ohio to Indiana for an abortion in July \u2014 make their way back into the headlines over the coming month. And then there\u2019s the fact that only 25 percent of young women in the American Perspectives Survey said they were following news about the midterm elections very closely, suggesting that their concern about abortion rights may not translate into enthusiasm to vote in the upcoming elections. But Mary-Kate Lizotte, an Augusta University political scientist who studies women\u2019s political participation, said that the abrupt restrictions on abortion access could end up being a generation-defining event, even if young women don\u2019t dramatically reshape the outcome of the midterms. After all, only a handful of races will determine which party controls Congress \u2014 not all of them statewide \u2014 and these elections generally get less attention than in presidential years. Whether or not the issue brings a lot of young women to the polls in key races, she said, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision and the bans that followed are likely to shape young women\u2019s views of the GOP for years to come, potentially solidifying their antipathy to the party as they grow older and start voting more regularly.  \u201cFor a lot of voters, particularly young women who are going to be impacted in a very real way, this is going to be one of the first times that they really cared about something when it comes to politics,\u201d said Lizotte. \u201cThat\u2019s going to anchor the way many [young women] view the parties \u2014 not just in 2022, but in 2024 and beyond.\u201d\u00a0",

    "How 5 Latino Voters Are Thinking About The Midterms": [
        "By Alex Samuels",
        " Welcome to Voices Of Color, a column that explores what\u2019s on the minds of voters of color in this year\u2019s midterm elections. Too often, media coverage focuses on the political preferences of white people with euphemisms like \u201csuburban women\u201d or \u201cmiddle class.\u201d But in this column, we want to know what makes voters of color tick.\u00a0 We want to explore their views on politics, policy, the future of our democracy, our two-party system and everything in between. We hope that this column offers fresh perspectives from the minds of those whose political opinions are often overlooked or assumed. If you think you might be a good fit for this column, fill out this form \u2014 we might get in touch. It was one of the big puzzles of the 2020 election: Why did Latino voters \u2014\u00a0who typically lean Democratic \u2014 swing toward former President Donald Trump?\u00a0 Was it his promise of economic prosperity for Latino Americans? After all, the No. 1 issue for Hispanic registered voters \u2014 like the broader electorate \u2014 that year was the economy, according to the Pew Research Center. Or could it have been his pledge to construct a border wall and enforce a type of \u201claw and order\u201d along the U.S.-Mexico border, which might have appealed to certain Southern voters, particularly those in Texas? It\u2019s still not entirely clear. The upcoming midterm elections will test the durability of Republican gains \u2014 and Democratic losses \u2014 among this key group. Both parties are doubling down on their efforts to appeal to Latino Americans. But perhaps the most important lesson from 2020 was that Latino voters \u2014 the country\u2019s fastest-growing voting bloc \u2014 can\u2019t be painted with a broad brush. \u201cWe\u2019re a growing percentage of the population, and, over time, we\u2019ve become even more important to the parties,\u201d said Georgiana Hernandez, 66, of New Mexico. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see Latinos as monolithic. And in tight races, any movement you can get among the racial groups is important. It all comes down to being attuned to our needs and appealing to issues that are important to people of different stripes.\u201d Still, I wanted to see what was on the minds of five Latino voters in the lead-up to the 2022 midterm elections. Unsurprisingly, and as the chart below illustrates, a range of policies are top of mind for Latino voters when it comes to deciding who they\u2019ll cast a ballot for.\u00a0 While, like for all Americans, economic issues like inflation and cost of living are still Latino voters\u2019 No. 1 concern, according a recent NALEO poll, abortion rights and health care were also top of mind for a number of surveyed respondents. (This range of priorities was reflected in my interviews, too.)\u00a0\u00a0 But when it comes to the top issue on the minds of Latino Americans, neither party has a clear advantage. As the chart below suggests, respondents are almost evenly split on which party they trust more on economic issues. They tend to favor Democrats over Republicans, however, on other issues, like immigration and gun policy, but my reporting also suggests that many Latinos are more socially conservative, which could be a problem for Democrats.\u00a0  In short, this is why polling on Latino voters is often so hard to gauge \u2014 like all voters, they hold different, often competing, priorities. And in speaking to these five people, I wanted to get a better grip on these complexities as we move closer to Election Day. I learned that these Latino voters want the parties to treat them as a complex, multifaceted voting bloc \u2014 and they\u2019re aware of the power they wield. As Hernandez told me: \u201cLatinos can really swing things one way or the other, so it\u2019s no surprise to me that our votes are considered competitive.\u201d The interviews below have been edited and condensed for clarity.\u00a0 Alex Samuels: What are the most important issues to you heading into the midterm elections? Carlos Ruiz (58, Arizona, Republican): The economy and inflation are the most important issues to me, but I\u2019m also prioritizing the lack of control on the border.\u00a0 Alicia Bejarano (19, South Carolina, Libertarian): This year, I\u2019m going to be looking closely at what candidates have to say about gun reform and their reaction to the recent overturning of Roe v. Wade. I\u2019m also interested in issues related to policing and police accountability. I don\u2019t know whether I have strong feelings about the police being defunded, but, at least currently, I feel like law enforcement isn\u2019t capable of de-escalating situations in a way that doesn\u2019t lead to more violence or death.\u00a0 Jaime Vasquez (20, Texas, Republican): My top concern right now is making sure that Americans get to keep our natural rights as they\u2019re recognized in the Constitution. It\u2019s important to realize that without the Second Amendment, there can be no First Amendment. My No. 2 issue is the economy, since I have concerns about increased government spending by the Democrats.  Diana Agapay (42, Florida, Democrat): My top issue going into the midterms is expanding abortion access and improving health care access for women. My second top issue is investigating any previous presidential administration that has done anything illegal and making sure that they go through our existing criminal justice system \u2014 as any non-government figure would. And the third top issue for me is probably inflation, but I think that\u2019ll eventually calm down. Georgiana Hernandez (66, New Mexico, Democrat): There are three: One is climate change, which I\u2019ve been very concerned about for quite a while. The second is reproductive rights. And the third is voting rights. AS: Can you reflect a bit on your mood going into this election and whether it\u2019s different from two years ago? Vasquez: I don\u2019t feel any more enthusiastic for this election than I was in 2020. Two years ago, I quickly realized what the election meant \u2014 and the importance of it. Even though [Republicans] were in power at the time, the election felt like an inflection point because the race could have swung either way. And I still feel that way heading into this year\u2019s midterm elections. We\u2019re still at a crossroads, it seems, and there\u2019s the same level of enthusiasm to go and vote [this year] \u2014 at least on my part. Hernandez: I\u2019m more anxious about the midterm elections than I was for the elections in 2020. Don\u2019t get me wrong, 2020 was very anxiety inducing, but I feel like the stakes are much higher now for Democrats.  AS: During the 2020 election, Latino voters moved further right. Why do you think that happened? Have you personally moved more toward Republicans since 2016; if so, why?  Ruiz: I\u2019ve been a registered Republican since I was 18 \u2014 which would\u2019ve been around the Reagan era. But I think the economic prosperity from 2016 through 2020 was across the board and that Hispanics saw a more open, unregulated economy with lower taxes that allowed more people to either increase their wages or grow their businesses. As a result, I think people moved more toward Republicans and the political philosophy that supports that kind of economic environment.\u00a0 Bejarano: I didn\u2019t necessarily move right since 2016, and I can\u2019t speak for all Latino voters, but I can speak from experience when saying this: I come from a Hispanic family, and a majority of them are Republicans. In the Hispanic community, there\u2019s this \u2018bootstrap\u2019 ideology among people who immigrated to the United States that you have to \u2018do the work\u2019 to get here. I\u2019ve noticed that in my family, and in talks with other Hispanic families, we have this sense of responsibility and honor. And that honor arises from the fact that we all came into this country \u2018the right way.\u2019 Then you have Republicans who are basically saying, \u2018Yes, that\u2019s exactly what we want.\u2019 I\u2019m personally not drawn to that bootstrap ideology, but since Republicans are the main ones saying it, I can understand why some Hispanics moved toward them.  Vasquez: My views are still the same as they were in 2016, but I think I\u2019ve become more bold and open in my support for Republicans. My family and I have been a small minority in South Texas because it has been blue for decades, and we were always that one Republican family in the neighborhood that felt like our vote didn\u2019t matter. But, in 2020, things shifted here, and my area \u2014 and the Rio Grande Valley, more broadly \u2014 swung pretty heavily toward Republicans. The fact that the politics down here changed so much in just four years was pretty shocking, to be honest. I\u2019m not really sure what attributed to the switch, but I can make some guesses: South Texas, especially the RGV, is still very much rooted in traditional values similar to what many conservative voices in the Republican Party advocate. I also think that Democrats moving further left on social issues, particularly the \u2018defund the police\u2019 narrative, turned off voters who had families working in law enforcement or border patrol. Agapay: I did not move toward Republicans at all. If anything, I\u2019ve moved more left. I do have thoughts, though, on why some Latino voters may have moved toward Republicans. I\u2019m a first-generation American, both of my parents immigrated to this country, and I believe that Latinos tend to be more conservative, especially when it comes to their faith. I also think that Republicans use fear-based messaging in their attempts to target Latino voters and, in a sense, have convinced some of us to be fearful of Democrats.\u00a0 AS: As of today, do you lean more toward the Democratic Party, the Republican Party or neither? And what, if anything, would it take for you to support the opposing party?  Ruiz: The Republican Party. But if a Republican candidate had what I would call a very fringe philosophy and a Democratic candidate was more centrist, that might cause me to vote for the Democrat. But if I had a choice between a person that had fringe philosophies on the left and fringe philosophies on the right, I\u2019d probably just not vote in that race. Bejarano: In terms of issues like gun reform, police accountability and my disapproval over the overturning of Roe \u2014 those are issues that I trust the Democrats on more. So, for the moment, you could say I have nothing against Democrats because we have a lot of the same values. That said, I\u2019m not Democratic nor Republican: I\u2019m a Libertarian. And in order for me to support Republicans, I\u2019d need to see their grip on the interpretation of the Constitution loosen a bit to allow for new ideas to flourish that would better accommodate our modern society. Vasquez: Definitely Republicans. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that Democrats and I currently see eye-to-eye on, so I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s anything that could convince me to vote for them.\u00a0 Agapay: The Democratic Party, but I could probably support a Republican candidate who\u2019s actually going to be truthful and stand up to the nonsense that has been coming out of the Republican Party for the past six years.\u00a0 Hernandez: Definitely the Democratic Party. I don\u2019t see myself ever supporting a Republican. AS: Why do you think Latino voters are such a coveted bloc for both major political parties? Ruiz: We are a large population but, historically, our voting propensity is not that high. And if Latino voters could be encouraged to cast their ballots more frequently, then all of a sudden both parties would look at them as a large, more competitive voting bloc as they do with other races. Bejarano: As bad as it sounds, I think both parties just want to say that they have the minority vote. They see it as, \u2018Oh, these are the honest and good people that worked hard to get here.\u2019 But that alone is not sound logic and is not a good enough reason alone for them to court Latino voters.\u00a0 Vasquez: I think it has to do with the changing demographics of the country over the last two censuses. Since at least 2010, there\u2019s been a dramatic increase in the Hispanic population. And bringing more Hispanic voters into your tent could really change the dynamics of each party\u2019s politics \u2014 Republicans especially. There has always been this narrative that Republicans are anti-minority, and they have a big opportunity to change that if they get more Hispanic voters on their side. Meanwhile, the Democrats have always tried to tout themselves as the pro-minority party, so they probably want to maintain that talking point because they think it makes them seem, in my opinion, more morally virtuous.  Agapay: For the simple fact that we are growing in numbers. Plus, I think Latino voters finally realized that we have a voice and that we can use our voice to sway elections. AS: How could each party better appeal to Latino voters?  Ruiz: I grew up middle-class: My father was a heavy equipment operator and my mom was an office worker, but all of my siblings and I went to college and we became more successful than our parents had. That\u2019s the American Dream, and Democrats would do a bit better if they sent a similar kind of message to Latinos that the American Dream is possible through hard work and education. And I think Republicans have improved their messaging on immigration to be less offensive, but some of the language there should be centered more on the needs of our country versus talking about specific groups of people coming in. Bejarano: They need to go to the places where we are. Whenever I hear about politicians traveling, they\u2019re always going to Texas or California or Florida because there happen to be large swaths of Latinos living there. But, in addition, they should also go visit places like South Carolina. I certainly didn\u2019t expect to find anyone here of my same heritage, but we do have a foundation; and both parties could do a better job at tapping into Latino populations in other, smaller, states. Both parties could also do a better job at talking with younger Hispanics between the ages of 19 and 25. I feel like we\u2019re not as readily acknowledged. Hernandez: I think both sides could do a better job at listening to what Latino voters are asking for, but that will differ depending on where we live. For example, Latino voters living in more rural areas may have different needs than those, say, living in large urban or suburban areas.\u00a0 AS: Recent polling shows that the economy is a top issue for Latino voters. Which party do you agree with more on economic issues, and why? Bejarano: I\u2019m more frugal with money, which, as I understand, is more in line with the Republican Party\u2019s way of thinking. Vasquez: I definitely agree with the conservative point of view, which takes a more laissez-faire [economic] approach, coincided with limited government spending and lower taxes on individuals. Hernandez: I definitely agree more with the Democratic Party. I think that President Biden has done as much as he can do to try to lower gasoline prices, but there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s not in his control as far as supply chain issues go.\u00a0 AS: Are there other issues where you trust one party over the other? If so, what are those issues? Ruiz: On crime, I trust the Republicans more. And even though this is more of a local issue, I think housing affordability is something that the Democrats would be a little bit better at addressing because they might be more creative with planning and zoning. Vasquez: On crime and immigration, I trust the Republican Party more. Hernandez: I trust the Democratic Party to do what\u2019s in the best interest of the American people overall. I have no faith in the Republican Party, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m nervous for this election \u2014 I can\u2019t bear to think about the potential consequences if we lose both the House and Senate.",

    "The Supreme Court Is On The Verge Of Killing The Voting Rights Act": [
        "By Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux",
        " The beginning of the end for the Voting Rights Act started more than 30 years ago. On Oct. 4, the end of the end is likely to begin. This term, the Supreme Court is hearing a case about whether Alabama\u2019s newly drawn congressional maps violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibits voting practices or procedures that discriminate on the basis of race. In a seven-district state, the new maps included only one majority-Black district even though the state has a population that is more than one-quarter Black. The groups challenging the maps say that because it would be relatively easy to draw a map with two majority-Black districts, the state is legally obligated to do so. But Alabama Republicans countered by arguing they don\u2019t have a requirement to use the plaintiffs\u2019 maps, because creating a second majority-Black district would violate other race-neutral criteria used in redistricting.  The justices\u2019 ruling could have implications that go far beyond Alabama, potentially neutering what remains of the Voting Rights Act \u2014 a seminal piece of legislation that is ostensibly permanent yet constantly imperiled.\u00a0 The current Supreme Court justices, under Chief Justice John Roberts, might strike the final blow against the Voting Rights Act, whether it\u2019s in this case or a future one. But they didn\u2019t strike the first blow. According to a FiveThirtyEight analysis of Supreme Court cases involving the Voting Rights Act, most of the first 20 years of decisions interpreting the law went in a liberal direction.1 That changed in the late 1980s, when more right-leaning justices joined the bench and, not coincidentally, more and more of decisions overall started to go in a conservative direction. Of the seven Voting Rights Act cases that the court has heard in the Roberts era, only one had a liberal outcome. \u201cStarting in the 1990s as the court\u2019s composition changed, the court has been cutting back or refusing to expand Section 2 in virtually every case it\u2019s had,\u201d said Richard H. Pildes, a constitutional law professor at New York University. Now, the Roberts court could be poised to continue that trajectory by fundamentally altering the way that Section 2 operates. Up until now, the court has taken the perspective that, in order to comply with the act, states are in some situations required to take race into consideration as the primary factor in the redistricting process. Alabama Republicans are now arguing that it\u2019s discriminatory to prioritize race over other traditional redistricting techniques, such as having compact districts, contiguous boundaries or avoiding crossing county or town boundaries. Several experts, including Pildes, told FiveThirtyEight that a ruling that sides with Alabama would be a radical departure from previous interpretations of the law and would likely free states to draw congressional or state legislative maps where minority voters have less political power relative to their numbers.  In that sense, the outcome of this case could be very similar to a 2013 ruling in which the Roberts court gutted another section of the Voting Rights Act, freeing a group of states with histories of discrimination against minority voters to change their election laws without federal approval. In the years afterward, those states shuttered thousands of polling places, intensified their voter purges and changed voting laws in other ways that disproportionately affect minority voters. When it was passed in 1965, two crucial sections of the Voting Rights Act \u2014 Section 2 and Section 5 \u2014 tackled the problem of race-based voter suppression. Section 5 was proactive, trying to stop discrimination before it occurred by requiring states with a history of discrimination to run any changes to their election laws by the federal government in a process that was known as \u201cpreclearance.\u201d\u00a0 Section 2, on the other hand, was designed to handle discrimination after it happened. It works as an enforcement mechanism for the Fifteenth Amendment, which says that the right to vote can\u2019t be denied or limited on the basis of race. Effectively, it gave minority voters another avenue to bring voter-suppression claims to the courts. Crucially, that applies to the redistricting process since it forbade states from drawing district lines in a way that diluted racial minorities\u2019 votes. According to Jesse Rhodes, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst who has written on the history of the Voting Rights Act, the law was designed to provide \u201can equal opportunity for [minority voters] to elect candidates that represent them and wield power in proportion to their numbers.\u201d  Over the past few decades, Section 2 has primarily been used as a weapon against a practice known as racial gerrymandering \u2014 where lawmakers spread minority voters across state and federal legislative districts, or pack them into districts, in a way that made it impossible for those groups to elect the candidates of their choice. (We previously reported on how Section 2 reshaped North Carolina as part of \u201cThe Gerrymandering Project.\u201d) In many ways, the case in Alabama is a textbook example, according to Franita Tolson, an election law professor at the University of Southern California. \u201cA decade ago, we would have said that this is a clear Section 2 violation,\u201d Tolson said. \u201cAfrican Americans didn\u2019t get the number of seats they were entitled to. Very straightforward.\u201d The panel of lower court judges who heard the case earlier this year \u2014 which included two Trump appointees \u2014 agreed. But several experts, including Tolson, told me that they don\u2019t expect the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative supermajority to take this tack. That\u2019s because the court has grown increasingly hostile to the Voting Rights Act over the past few decades. The timing is not a coincidence. Roberts, who has been chief justice since 2005, has been critical of the law \u2014 and Section 2 \u2014 since he was a young government lawyer in the 1980s.\u00a0 But it goes beyond Roberts. In February, five of the conservatives voted to restore Alabama\u2019s congressional map \u2014 the one with only one majority-Black district \u2014 for the 2022 election after the map had been overturned by the lower-court panel. Roberts dissented, saying that the lower-court judges had applied the law correctly. But he added that the Supreme Court\u2019s previous cases \u201chave engendered considerable disagreement and uncertainty regarding the nature and contours of a vote dilution claim,\u201d suggesting that he may be open to rethinking the scope of Section 2. Since Roberts was sworn in, the Supreme Court has ruled on seven cases involving the Voting Rights Act, according to our analysis of data from the Supreme Court Database. In five of those cases, the ruling went in a conservative direction. One of the other cases was a complex opinion where the median justice, Anthony Kennedy, joined the court\u2019s liberals to overturn one congressional district in Texas, saying that it had unconstitutionally diluted Latinos\u2019 votes. In the other \u201cliberal\u201d outcome, the court ruled in a 2008 case involving a Texas utility district that Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act wasn\u2019t unconstitutional. Five years later, it eviscerated the preclearance requirement in another case, Shelby County v. Holder. That 2013 ruling didn\u2019t invalidate Section 5 altogether, but it did reject the formula that Congress used to determine which jurisdictions were subject to preclearance, saying that it relied on outdated data. A ruling in favor of Alabama in this case would have a different \u2014 but still significant \u2014 impact. In the short-term, it would mean that there are fewer majority Black districts in Alabama and Louisiana, where a similar court case is unfolding. The justices could go further, too, if they fully side with Alabama\u2019s argument in the case. One analysis found that if other states used the \u201crace-blind\u201d approach that Alabama is advocating for, the total number of majority-minority districts would be substantially lower. The analysis also found that in the South, where this approach would have the biggest impact, a race-blind map would benefit Republicans.2 That isn\u2019t the way the Voting Rights Act has been interpreted up until now. \u201cThe court has accepted the principle that if the use of race is necessary to comply with the Voting Rights Act, then it\u2019s constitutional to use race to do so,\u201d Pildes said. But this case could be an opportunity to revisit \u2014 and significantly revise \u2014 the Voting Rights Act\u2019s requirements. And that could end up reducing minority voters\u2019 electoral power. CORRECTION (Oct. 3, 9:17 a.m.): An earlier version of this article implied the oral argument for the case about Alabama\u2019s redistricting map will take place on Oct. 3. It is happening on Oct. 4.",

    "How Natural Disasters Can Change A Politician": [
        "By Maggie Koerth",
        " In September 2017, Hurricane Irma swept across the southern tip of Florida, swamping what was then the state\u2019s 26th Congressional District. The following July, that district\u2019s Republican representative, Carlos Curbelo, introduced a bill that would tax greenhouse-gas emissions to help reduce the impact of climate change on his hurricane-prone constituency. Curbelo\u2019s party affiliation raised eyebrows at the time, but for him, the threat of recurrent disasters sent political partisanship out the window. \u201cThis is not an academic discussion for those of us who live in South Florida. This is a local issue,\u201d he told Audubon magazine in 2018. And he\u2019s not alone. Today, although some one-quarter of elected officials walking the halls of Congress don\u2019t believe human-caused climate change is even real, research suggests that politicians can be persuaded to take action on climate change and other environmental issues. Unfortunately, it might take a headline-grabbing hurricane to do it. In the past decade, several studies have suggested that lawmakers are more likely to take action on climate change when they \u2014 and their constituents \u2014 have had to deal with the disastrous consequences of previously doing nothing.\u00a0 From the 1969 Cuyahoga River fire that led to the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency to the 1990 Oil Pollution Act that was born out of a series of oil spills, most notably from the Exxon Valdez, a long history of environmental disasters have inspired improvements in environmental policy, said M. Daniele Paserman, an economist at Boston University.\u00a0 \u201cDisasters make environmental problems more salient,\u201d he said. Paserman\u2019s research has found that, between 1989 and 2014, congresspeople from districts hit by a hurricane were more likely to sponsor or co-sponsor environmental regulatory bills in the following year. And he\u2019s not the only one who has noticed similar correlations. According to another study, which looked at abnormal temperature and precipitation trends between 2004 and 2011, members of Congress whose home states were experiencing weird weather were more likely to vote for all kinds of environmental legislation. More broadly, international research from 34 countries found that nuclear disasters increased the number of renewable-energy policies implemented for as long as seven years after the event.\u00a0 This line of research is relatively new and the number of studies relatively thin. But all of this builds on a larger question that has been studied more in depth: how personally experiencing the effects of climate change shape belief and behavior in the general public.\u00a0 A 2021 review of existing literature discovered ample evidence that living through a natural disaster is associated with higher levels of self-reported belief that climate change is a problem and a greater concern about what this might do to you and your family. Our own polling with Ipsos earlier this month showed something similar. Even among Republicans, nearly half of those who had experienced an extreme weather event in the past five years told us they were worried about climate change, compared with only 17 percent who hadn\u2019t experienced a natural disaster. But there are limits to the ability of a disaster to prevent future calamities. For one thing, the same review paper that showed increased belief in climate change didn\u2019t find a corresponding increase in behaviors that would deal with that issue. And changes in belief are still heavily moderated by what people already think. For example, in a 2019 survey of people who experienced severe flooding in the United Kingdom during the winter of 2013-14, the ones who walked away with the highest levels of concern about climate change were those who had already attributed floods to global warming.\u00a0 So, it probably shouldn\u2019t be a shock that the much smaller number of papers looking at how politicians might change their behavior in the face of climate change comes with its own set of caveats and complications. Studies have indicated that only countries with strong democracies see an increase in climate policy following climate disasters. And Paserman\u2019s study found that the effects were tightly linked to proximity to the disaster. Even lawmakers who served in the same state where a hurricane occurred but whose districts were unaffected weren\u2019t as likely to step up for political change.\u00a0 And while that paper found that politicians who experienced climate disasters were more likely to push for climate policies regardless of party, a different study \u2014 the one that showed abnormal temperature and precipitation trends were correlated with representatives\u2019 environmental votes \u2014 found that party did matter. Moderate Democrats made the biggest shift toward more environmental-policy support, said Erich Muehlegger, an economist at the University of California, Davis, and an author on that paper. \u201cWe didn\u2019t find much of a result for Republicans, nor did we find much of a result for the more strident Democrats, though that might be due to the fact that they were always voting for environmental regulations,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t become more pro-environment if you were already on top of all those issues.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s going to take a lot more research to fully understand why politicians sometimes change their policy in the face of climate disaster and sometimes don\u2019t. Meanwhile, just because lawmakers are responding to natural disasters with environmental votes doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t seeing other, seedier kinds of legislative opportunities from the same event. Ethan Kaplan, an economist at University of Maryland, College Park, and his colleagues found that politicians are likely to use the immediate aftermath of a natural disaster to push through votes favoring the concerns of special-interest donors when nobody is paying attention. That\u2019s not a contradiction to the idea that disaster could prompt politicians to take action on climate change. Instead, Kaplan said, the two things can run parallel. A disaster can create a distraction for donors\u2019 goals in the short term, even as it prompts greater environmental policies in the long run.\u00a0",

    "5 Reasons For Democrats To Still Be Concerned About The Midterms": [
        "By Nate Silver",
        " Last week, I argued that there weren\u2019t yet clear signs of a Republican comeback in polls of the midterm elections. This week? The case for a GOP rebound is a little better. For one, Republicans can cite some individual polls that have been favorable for them. There was a poll this weekend from ABC News1 and the Washington Post, which found Republicans 5 points ahead on the generic congressional ballot among likely voters \u2014 a result which would all but assure the GOP of winning the House and make the Senate an uphill battle for Democrats. Republican candidates have also pretty clearly gained ground in some individual Senate races, such as Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. There are counterexamples, though. Another highly rated pollster, Selzer & Co., published a poll this week showing Democrats 4 points ahead on the generic ballot among likely voters. Meanwhile, Democrats can cite a few strong recent Senate polls of their own in states such as Ohio and New Hampshire. Overall, Democrats\u2019 chances of winning the Senate are 68-in-100, according to the Deluxe version of our forecast. That\u2019s down from a high of 71-in-100, which persisted from Sept. 13 to Sept. 20, though that change isn\u2019t large in the big scheme of things. In the House, Democrats\u2019 chances are 31-in-100, which reflects an even smaller change; their chances were 32-in-100 on Sept. 23 and 24. Still, we\u2019re overdue for a reminder of why Republicans still could do quite well for themselves in November. So here are five major reasons for hope for the GOP \u2014 and concern for Democrats.\u00a0 As an added twist, we\u2019ll engage in a bit of model talk as we review these reasons. That is, I\u2019ll tell you whether I think these reasons for hope/concern (depending on who you\u2019re rooting for) are adequately accounted for by our model \u2014 or whether they reflect information outside of its scope and assumptions. Sure, this election could be an exception to the usual midterm pushback against the president\u2019s party. But, it\u2019s not always smart to bet on exceptions. So it\u2019s worth going back over the reasons why I and other analysts initially expected this election to be a strong one for Republicans.\u00a0 Does the FiveThirtyEight model account for this? Yes. The Classic and Deluxe versions of our model use a blend of polls and fundamentals when evaluating the overall political environment and individual races.2 This makes a pretty big difference in the House, where our Lite forecast, which tries to predict the race based on polls alone, gives Republicans a 61-in-100 chance of a House takeover. Those odds jump to 68-in-100 percent in the Deluxe forecast, which takes fundamentals into account. This also boosts the odds of Republicans, who have a 23-in-100 chance of winning the Senate in Lite but a 32-in-100 chance in Deluxe. The differences between the forecasts were larger at earlier points in the cycle; there isn\u2019t as much time left now for the polls to converge toward the fundamentals. Still, the model assumes that Republicans are more likely to gain ground than to lose ground in the polls between now and November. This is the argument recently advanced by Nate Cohn of The New York Times. During the summer, Democrats benefited from media and voter attention to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the Jan. 6 hearings, and the FBI investigation of former President Donald Trump. These issues tend to remind voters of Republican power and influence and potentially make the election more of a 2020-like choice between Democrats and Republicans and less of a referendum on Biden and Democrats\u2019 performance. But now, issues like immigration and the economy are again getting more headlines. That\u2019s not to say abortion and those other issues won\u2019t matter, but the summer could have reflected a best-case scenario for Democrats. Does the FiveThirtyEight model account for this? Not exactly. The model accounts for uncertainty due to future news events. But it doesn\u2019t make any assumptions about whether these surprises tend to benefit one party over another. But \u2026 I\u2019d be careful overthinking this. People who cover politics for a living, including me, live in a bubble full of people who pay far more attention to day-to-day political developments than regular voters do. Pundits\u2019 guesses about which stories voters will care about, or how they will affect their voting preferences, are often wrong. Moreover, the life cycle of stories tends to be pretty short. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019s decision to send immigrants to Martha\u2019s Vineyard was a huge story until about a week ago, but now we have a devastating hurricane and a new wave of economic concerns that have usurped it. So in practice, assuming that future news events create uncertainty in both directions will usually be the best course. If I were actually betting on election outcomes at prediction markets \u2014 and no, I don\u2019t do that for a variety of reasons! \u2014 I\u2019d pay attention to the flow of campaign advertising. Advertising may not matter that much in terms of moving votes in an era with relatively few swing voters. But it certainly matters some, and the effects can be short-lived. So if one candidate had a temporary edge on their airwaves, it might lead to a temporary surge in the polls, which would then recede. So one potential source of concern for Democrats would be if they\u2019d dominated the advertising race during the summer, but only temporarily. Is this happening? I honestly don\u2019t know. There are some accounts of Republican groups having boosted spending recently. But while public fundraising and campaign spending is relatively easy to track, outside spending also plays a large role and is more opaque. Moreover, outside spending has tended to favor conservatives and Republicans this cycle. With that said, not every dollar is spent equally well. Outside groups don\u2019t get the same favorable advertising rates that campaigns themselves do, and it\u2019s cheaper to buy ads in advance rather than at the last minute. Does the FiveThirtyEight model account for this? Not really. The model doesn\u2019t make any assumptions at all about advertising. It doesn\u2019t discount or adjust a poll because it came during an advertising blitz, for example. Nor does it make any assumption about future advertising spend. The model does account for fundraising; money raised from individual donors is one of the factors that the model evaluates in addition to the polls. But this is more because fundraising tends to be a proxy for grassroots support rather than because of any additional advertising leverage it provides. One reason that the aforementioned ABC News poll was so worrying for Democrats is because of the relatively large enthusiasm differential it showed between registered voters \u2014 among whom Democrats trailed on the generic ballot by only 1 percentage point \u2014 and likely voters, among whom they trailed by 5. That 4-point \u201centhusiasm gap\u201d was somewhat reminiscent of the 2010 midterms, when there was roughly a 6-point gap between polls of registered and likely voters, leading to a catastrophic election for Democrats. But other polls do not show the same enthusiasm disadvantage for Democrats. As Cohn mentions, for instance, there was only a 1-point enthusiasm gap in The New York Times\u2019s recent generic ballot polling. Other polls in the wake of the Dobbs decision found that while Republicans were more excited than usual to vote at the midterms, so were Democrats. Democrats have also tended to have strong turnout in recent special elections and ballot referendums. The consensus of the evidence points toward a modest enthusiasm gap favoring Republicans \u2014 enough to make matters harder for Democrats, especially in the House \u2014 but nothing like the magnitude of 2010. Does the FiveThirtyEight model account for this? Yes, the model explicitly accounts for the likely GOP enthusiasm advantage. Specifically, it adjusts polls of registered voters to make them equivalent to polls of likely voters. Initially, this adjustment is based on historical patterns: Republican voters have historically been more likely to turn out than Democratic ones, and voters of the opposition party are more likely to turn out than voters from the president\u2019s party.3 In 2018, those factors offset one another (Republicans had the traditional enthusiasm advantage, but Democrats were the opposition party). But this year, they\u2019re both working in the GOP\u2019s favor. I can also see an argument that this assumption is too generous to Republicans, though. Voters at the midterms tend to be older, whiter and more well-educated than voters in presidential years. Historically, these factors all tended to favor Republicans. Now, however \u2014 while Republicans are still older and whiter \u2014 Democrats tend to dominate among college-educated voters, who are considerably more likely to turn out to vote.  Let me put this carefully. Two weeks ago, I wrote about why I don\u2019t agree with the presumption that polls \u2014 despite their shortcomings in 2016 and 2020 \u2014 are biased toward Democrats:  There are a lot of qualifications here. It doesn\u2019t mean that the polls can\u2019t have a bad year. But the idea behind the FiveThirtyEight model is that they\u2019ll be biased toward Democrats in some years, they\u2019ll be biased toward Republicans in some years, and they\u2019ll be unbiased in some years \u2014 and it\u2019s hard to know what you\u2019re getting ahead of time. I\u2019ve read various rebuttals to this article, some of which I find a little lacking. For instance, I simply don\u2019t think it\u2019s correct to claim, as Andrew Prokop recently did in Vox, that polls overestimated Democratic performance in 2018.4 To treat anti-Republican bias in the polls as a sort of inescapable empirical regularity based on a sample of two election cycles, neither of which was the most recent midterm, is making too much of limited evidence. But does that mean I give no credence at all to what we might call the Predictable Democratic Polling Bias (PDPB) hypothesis? No, of course not. Good fox-like forecasters can hold multiple ideas or hypotheses in their head at once. PDPB has some things going for it. My mental model of the race might be something like: mostly the FiveThirtyEight forecast, but with a little smidge of weight that PDPB is real. What\u2019s the case for PDPB? Again, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an empirical one. Empirically, the evidence strongly shows that polling bias is unpredictable. But the theoretical case that analyst Richard Hanania makes for PDPB in his recent Substack post is plausible. If, fundamentally, Republicans are less likely to answer surveys because (for instance) they have lower social trust, that\u2019s not necessarily an intractable problem. But it could be one that hasn\u2019t been addressed yet. It could take pollsters a couple of election cycles to work out the right approach, especially if it requires abandoning traditional polling best practices. Interestingly enough, PDPB wouldn\u2019t necessarily doom Democrats in the Senate. Even if polls had a 3-point pro-Democratic bias, Democrat John Fetterman would still be favored in Pennsylvania, where he leads by 6 points in our polling average. Democratic incumbents Raphael Warnock in Georgia and Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada would technically be underdogs (they currently lead by 2.1 and 0.7 percentage points, respectively). But Georgia and Nevada have had fairly accurate polling in recent years. Any amount of PDPB would doom Democrats\u2019 chances in the House, however. Does the FiveThirtyEight model account for this? Sort of. Although the model doesn\u2019t assume any sort of permanent polling bias, it does give some weight to the fundamentals, and as I mentioned above, the fundamentals are more favorable to Republicans than the polls alone. The Deluxe forecast also considers expert ratings, and although how it uses these ratings is slightly complicated (read the methodology section for more), those do help Republican odds in the Senate. Perhaps if you give a little bit of extra mental weight to PDPB, it would be enough to account for the relatively small differences between the FiveThirtyEight forecast and betting markets. For instance, betting markets give Republicans a 39 percent chance of winning Senate control, as compared to 31 percent in our Deluxe forecast, and a 75 percent chance of House control, instead of 68 percent. Those are small enough differences that I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d make huge bets on either side.",

    "Iranians Are Ready For A Different Approach to Religion and Government": [
        "By Zoha Qamar",
        " Welcome to Pollapalooza, our weekly polling roundup. Protests in Iran have been raging on for nearly two weeks because 22-year-old Mahsa Amini died in the custody of the \u201cmorality police\u201d after she allegedly failed to comply with the nation\u2019s veiling laws. The protests that began on the streets of Saqqez, her hometown, have now spread to roughly 80 cities across the nation, as Iranian women lead demonstrations in defiance of a law that mandates they cover their hair and wear loose-fitting clothes while in public. At least 76 people have died, although the toll is likely higher as internet restrictions have made information harder to confirm.  Amini\u2019s death may have sparked this recent uprising, but data shows Iranian opposition toward required veiling isn\u2019t new. The Group for Analyzing and Measuring Attitudes in Iran, a Netherlands-based research foundation, conducted a comprehensive study in 2020 on Iranians\u2019 opinions about religion and found that a whopping 72 percent of literate Iranians over age 191 disagreed with the government mandating that women wear the hijab in public, compared with only 15 percent who agreed with it. Over the years, those who have subverted the law have faced violent beatings and, in the case of Amini, fatal consequences at the hands of the government.\u00a0 These events have brought a simmering question to a boil: In a world increasingly secular and interconnected, what role do people think theology should play in determining law?\u00a0 While Iran is now associated with mandatory veiling, that was not always the case. In 1936, the penultimate shah of Iran, Reza Shah Pahlavi, decreed a ban on hijab in an attempt to promote European attire. Women who failed to comply with this prior law similarly faced punishments, such as imprisonment. The newer mandate, which Iranians are protesting now, was implemented when the pro-Western, secular monarchy was replaced with an Islamic theocracy after the 1979 revolution.  First, the veil was banned, and now it\u2019s mandatory. But once again, most Iranians are proponents of change \u2014 not just for hijab law but also for the role of religion in government more broadly. Only 22 percent of literate Iranians over age 192 believe an Islamic republic is the most suitable governing structure for their country, according to a survey by GAMAAN conducted in February. Meanwhile, in a separate question, 88 percent agreed that having a democratic system would be a good idea.\u00a0 Also in that study, two-thirds said they did not want a government run according to religious law, which challenges the inherent premise of the country\u2019s current governing structure. In contrast, according to a 2020 Pew Research Center study, half of all Americans thought the Bible should have at least some bearing on the law, despite this nation\u2019s principles separating church and state.\u00a0 In the decades since its 1979 revolution, Iran has faced its fair share of political uprisings \u2014 due to claims of rigged elections and soaring gas prices, for example. But this current political moment has uniquely united Iranian women across socioeconomic, ethnic and regional lines. Furthermore, the recent demonstrations are not simply a protest of the current ruling politicians but also one that challenges how religion underpins the law overall.  Outside of Iran, however, the global trend has been toward repression of religion in the public sphere. Pew has tracked government limitations on religion since 2007. According to data published in 2021, Pew found that the global level of politically affiliated religious restriction was higher than it had been for most of the prior decade. Meanwhile, the history of Iran shows that both forced and forbidden faith can lead to dangerous consequences for citizens.  The ongoing internet shutdowns will likely keep international eyes from seeing everything happening in Iran, including the government\u2019s violence toward those speaking up. But quashing protests will not necessarily mean quashing dissent. Although Ali Khamenei, Iran\u2019s current supreme leader, has long posited outside influences, especially the U.S., as the greatest threat to his rule, this moment suggests that Iran\u2019s own citizens \u2014 and its women in particular \u2014 could present a huge challenge to the power of theocracy. According to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s presidential approval tracker,3 42.0 percent of Americans approve of the job Biden is doing as president, while 52.2 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -10.2 points). At this time last week, 42.5 percent approved and 53.0 percent disapproved (a net approval rating of -10.5 points).

    "Supreme Court on Tuesday to hear debate on alleged racial gerrymandering in Alabama redistricting plan": [
        " \n        By\n        Brianna Herlihy   | Fox News ",
        " TheSupreme Court on Tuesdaywill hear oral arguments about whether the state of Alabama's congressional map illegally disadvantages Black voters. Following the 2020 census, Alabama created a new redistricting map for its seven seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. A group of Alabama voters, NAACP and Greater Birmingham Ministries filed a lawsuit, claiming the new maps limited the influence of Black voters by placing people from \"majority-Black counties \u2026 into majority-White Congressional districts in low enough numbers that Black voters have no electoral influence.\" They argue the map should be redrawn so that Alabama has two majority-Black districts instead of just one, Congressional District 7 (CD 7). Alabama is set to argue that should the lawsuit prevail, the state will be forced into an unconstitutional practice of prioritizing race in creating election rules \u2014 which is what plaintiffs have accused the state of doing. FIVE MONTHS LATER, SUPREME COURT STILL INVESTIGATING WHO LEAKED THE ABORTION CASE The state adds that Alabama\u2019s redistricting plan followed existing districting lines and attempted to make \"race-neutral adjustments for small shifts in population over the last decade but otherwise retain existing district lines.\" However, plaintiffs say the demographics of the state means Alabama needs to do more to give Black voters a chance to elect a Black representative. \"In the twentieth century, Black Alabamians have never elected a congressional representative in any district other than the packed majority-Black CD 7. And CD 7 has only been a majority-Black district since 1992,\" plaintiffs argue. \"As a result, Black Alabamians have the opportunity to elect a candidate of choice in only 14% of the congressional delegation\u2026despite making up over 27% of Alabama\u2019s voting age population.\" The issue before the court iswhether Alabama violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits voting practices or procedures that discriminate on the basis of race. The decision could help bring long-awaited clarity to how the courts should interpret Section 2 in state redistricting cases. The case was first decided by a three-judge panel in an Alabama district court in January 2022. The district court ruled, withtwo Trump-appointed judges, that Alabama\u2019s map likely violated Section 2 and gave the state a two-week deadline to redraw a congressional map that includes two majority-Black districts. SUPREME COURT KICKS OFF NEW TERM WITH ORAL ARGUMENTS Alabama filed an emergency appeal to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, asking the court to reverse the lower court\u2019s decision. The Supreme Court granted the state\u2019s request, temporarily allowing the current maps to remain in effect while both sides make their case to the Supreme Court, which they will do in oral arguments on Oct. 4. Justice Thomas has previously written that Section 2 \"involved the federal courts, and indeed the Nation, in the enterprise of systematically dividing the country into electoral districts along racial lines \u2014 an enterprise of segregating the races into political homelands that amounts, in truth, to nothing short of a system of political apartheid.\" America First Legal filed a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of Alabama, arguing that, \"This Court should do more than reverse. It should end our Nation\u2019s decades-long unconstitutional experiment with court-mandated racial segregation in redistricting.\" SUMMARIES OF HIGH-PROFILE SUPREME COURT CASES However, opponents of Alabama's map say it is all about diluting the Black vote. \"These new maps weaponize race to undermine the political power of communities of color in Alabama,\" said Davin Rosborough, senior staff attorney for the ACLU and co-counsel on the case. \"These maps violate the Constitution and run contrary to basic principles of fairness and representative democracy.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Adam White, senior fellow with the American Enterprise Institute, told Fox News Digital that a favorable ruling for Alabama would make it harder for people to challenge state maps. \"If the Supreme Court overturns the lower court\u2019s decisions, that will reduce a lot of uncertainty around judicial review of districting because the people who want to challenge district lines will have to show much clearer evidence of discriminatory intent or effect,\" he said. \"So, judicial review will be much simpler.\"",

    "Jewish groups blast DC councilmember for praising Farrakhan: sought to 'honor' an 'out-and-out bigot'": [
        " \n        By\n        Cameron Cawthorne ,  Houston Keene   | Fox News ",
        " FIRST ON FOX:Several national Jewish groups blasted aWashington, D.C., city councilmemberwho praised the notoriously antisemitic Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan as seeking to \"honor\" an \"out-and-out bigot.\" Fox News Digital reached out to several Jewish advocacy groups about D.C. Councilmember Trayon White, Sr., attending and promoting an event featuring Farrakhan as the main speaker. The Anti-Defamation League(ADL) expressed disgust towards White over his praise of Farrakhan during an event commemorating the city\u2019s late former Mayor Marion Barry a little over two weeks ago. \"Louis Farrakhan is a notorious antisemite and racist who has long invoked hateful and conspiratorial rhetoric against the Jewish people,\" Meredith R. Weisel, the ADL\u2019s D.C. regional director, told Fox News Digital. \"It is deeply troubling that D.C. Councilmember Trayon White would seek to honor someone who is an out-and-out bigot,\" Weisel continued. \"As someone who has himself invoked antisemitic tropes in the past, we hope that White will reconsider his support for Farrakhan.\" DC LAWMAKER WHO LEFT HOLOCAUST MUSEUM EARLY AFTER ANTISEMITIC FACEBOOK VIDEO ATTENDS PRIVATE FARRAKHAN EVENT Democratic Ward 8 Council member Trayon White Sr., posted a six-minute video on his Instagram account of Farrakhan speaking to dozens of people at the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C. to remember the late D.C. Mayor Marion Barry, who passed away in 2014. TheInstagram captionwas \"Today we commemorated the relationship of the Honorable Marion Barry and the Honorable Louis Farrakhan in Washington DC that transformed the lives of many.\" Liora Rez, the executive director of antisemitism watchdog group, StopAntiSemitism, told Fox News Digital in a phone interview that the group was \"not surprised\" by White's attendance to the event and called him \"an antisemitic, Jew-hating bigot through and through\" whose apologies for his actions are \"fruitless\" and ring hollow. Rez also said White \"needs to be shunned in the D.C. circles\" and said that Mayor Muriel Bowser needs to \"apologize\" after her appointee, Cora Masters Barry, also attended the event. ABRAMS SPOKE AT CHURCH OF PRO-FARRAKHAN PASTOR WHO SAID GAY PEOPLE SHOULD FEEL 'UNCOMFORTABLE' IN THEIR 'SIN' She went on to say that she does not think Cora Masters Barry will apologize for attending the event and that she either \"brushes\" Farrakhan's antisemitism \"to the side, is willfully ignorant of it, or possibly subconsciously or consciously agrees with it.\" \"By having his antisemitic history and his current hatred that he so easily spews towards Jews. I don't think there's a person in America that right now wouldn't equate Farrakhan with antisemitic bigotry, homophobic bigotry, misogynistic bigotry,\" Rez said. \"So just the fact that she's still willing to associate and praise somebody like that, that tells us that she is greenlighting it and we have to throw a question back at her. Are you endorsing his hatred?\" Rez said. Rez added that Bowser \"needs to be meeting with the appropriate Jewish advocacy groups to discuss if people like Barry should be in her cabinet and if Bowser should be surrounding herself with people like that.\" During the event with Farrakhan, Cora Masters Barry lavished praise on Farrakhan multiple times, calling him a \"friend\" and \"member of the family\" while also telling him \"I love you more than words will ever say.\" \"Minister Farrakhan, we love you more than you love us. You just don't know it,\" she added. Farrakhan also praised Cora Masters Barry, saying, \"Praise God for this woman\" and added that she was a \"real treasure.\" Rez also said Farrakhan views Jews as \"insects,\" has attacked Jewish houses of worship as \"synagogues of Satan,\" and that the Nation of Islam leader has blamed Jews for \"pornography\" and \"pedophilia.\" \"I mean, if somebody is having a bad hair day, according to him, it's the Jews' fault,\" Rez said. Alan Ronkin, the regional director of the American Jewish Committee (AJC) in Washington, D.C., also called on White to disassociate with Farrakhan in a statement to Fox News Digital, saying that for \"decades, Louis Farrakhan has used antisemitic tropes blaming Jews for the world\u2019s problems.\" \"These messages should be condemned by every community leader, including Councilmember White,\" Ronkin said. \"No matter what the Nation of Islam\u2019s role in the community, it is unacceptable to denigrate one group in the name of empowering another.\" \"Rhetoric has impact and influence. Spreading antisemitism, such as referring to Jews as bloodsuckers and termites, divides our communities and alienates historic allies in the struggle for freedom and justice for all Americans,\" he continued. \"We call on Councilmember White to affirm his rejection of this ancient hatred. Every elected official should learn more about the history of antisemitism and how it has decimated the Jewish people over the centuries,\" Ronkin added. VP HARRIS MEETS WITH ACTIVIST WHO SAID 'F---' 'WHITE WOMEN\u2019 Fox News Digital reached out to all 13 DC councilmembers for comment, but 12 of them, including White, did not respond and Councilmember Nadeau's office declined to comment. White, who was unsuccessful in his bid for mayor in August, flipped the camera into \"selfie\" mode while recording Farrakhan speak, showing his face and other attendees at the private ceremony.Farrakhan recently tweeted a videoof himself speaking at the event, which briefly shows White stand up in the first 10 seconds of the video when Farrakhan starts speaking while recording the Nation of Islam leader's remarks. Outside of praising a noted antisemite, White has his own history of making unsavory comments about the Jews and questionable decisions when engaging with the Jewish community. Most notably, White came under fire in 2018 after he suggested in a video that the Rothschilds, a wealthy Jewish banking family, could influence the weather, promulgating the antisemitic conspiracy that Jews control the weather. \"Man, it just started snowing out of nowhere this morning, man,\" White said. \"Y'all better pay attention to this climate control, man, this climate manipulation.\" \"And that\u2019s a model based off the Rothschilds controlling the climate to create natural disasters they can pay for to own the cities, man,\" he added. A month after, White again found himself embroiled in controversy after he left a tour of the D.C. Holocaust Museum early and was found waiting outside as his staff finished the tour. White previously claimed he did not leave the Holocaust Museum early and told Fox 5 to check with Rabbi Batya to confirm his story, but the Jewish Community Relations Council, where she worked at the time, stood by their statement about him leaving early. After White left the tour, one of his aides reportedly asked if the Warsaw Ghetto was like \"a gated community\" \u2014 and said the Holocaust was \"a lot of synergy\" between the Jewish and African communities. \"I\u2019ll be coming back to see more of the museum. I didn\u2019t get a chance to see the whole thing,\" White said in 2018. \"But I think it\u2019s a lot of education here, a lot of synergy here between what happened to the Jewish community and the African community.\" \"This opportunity has given me the chance to meet a lot of great Jews, a lot of people. A lot of good Jews that I\u2019ve never had the chance to meet before,\" he later added. White also received scrutiny in April 2018 after it was reported that he made a $500 donation to the Nation of Islam's Saviour's Day weekend event, where Farrakhan said, \"Powerful Jews are my enemy.\" The donation was reportedly from his constituent services account and was later reimbursed by White. Additionally, the embattled council member called a meeting between him, Ronkin, Rabbi BatyaGlazer of the Jewish Community Relations Council (JCRC) of Greater Washington, former Bowser administration appointee Joshua Lopez, and fellow Councilmember Elissa Silverman to make amends after a \"unity rally\" in support of Whitewent horrendously wrong. The \"unity rally\" organized by Lopez saw the uninvited Nation of Islam representative Abdul Khadir Muhammad grab the megaphone and attack Silverman, who is Jewish, as well as others he referred to as \"fake Jews.\" During the antisemitic rant not stopped by Lopez, Muhammad also spoke in support of Farrakhan and his \"people.\" Muhammad later referred to Jews as \"termites\" in off-mic comments. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Washington Post reported in 2018 that White said he was not aware of the donation, but the treasurer told the Post that White instructed him to make the donation. Bowser's office did not respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s request for comment. Cora Masters Barry also did not respond.",

        " \n        By\n        Paul Steinhauser   | Fox News ",
        " FIRST ON FOX:Former Army Gen. Don Bolduc says he\u2019s on a \"new mission.\" And Bolduc, the Republican Senate nominee in the crucial general electionbattleground state of New Hampshire, says that mission is to take on what he derides as \"the career politicians\" in the nation\u2019s capital. Bolduc, who\u2019s challenging former governor and first-term Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan in a race that\u2019s among a handful across the country that will likely determine if the GOP wins back the Senate majority inNovember\u2019s midterm elections, on Tuesday launched the first TV ad of his entire campaign. \"He served 10 tours in Afghanistan, hunting terrorists on horseback.\u00a0Now, Don Bolduc is on a new mission,\" says the narrator at the top of the spot, which was shared first with Fox News. FIRST ON FOX: TOP PRO-DEMOCRATIC SENATE SUPER PAC TARGETS BOLDUC OVER ABORTION \"Five bronze stars, 10 combat tours. The guts to fight Washington's runaway inflation,\" the narrator says as he spotlights Bolduc\u2019s more than three decades in the military. \"A true American hero.\" Bolduc, in the commercial, emphasizes that his campaign \"isn't about political parties, this is about Granite Staters.\" And taking aim at Hassan without mentioning her by name, Bolduc says, \"We don't need career politicians that operate off of money, special interests, self-interests and lobbyists.\u00a0We need people with a heart.\" FIRST ON FOX: MITCH MCCONNELL-ALIGNED OUTSIDE GROUP PLEDGES TO SPEND $23 MILLION IN BATTLEGROUND NEW HAMPSHIRE Bolduc\u2019s campaign says the commercial will run statewide on broadcast and cable TV, but they didn\u2019t give any more details on the ad buy behind the spot. AdImpact, a nationally known ad tracking firm, reported on Monday night that Bolduc and theNational Republican Senatorial Committee(NRSC) had placed $268,000 to run the ad. And the NRSC is expected to spend roughly $8 million in New Hampshire during the general election. The former general, who\u2019s making his second straight bid for the Senate in his native state, ran a populist-style campaign, emphasizing his MAGA-Republican and outsider credentials in a crowded and combustible GOP primary. Last month, Bolduc narrowly edged more mainstream conservative Chuck Morse, the state Senate president, to win the nomination. Bolduc struggled with fundraising in his primary run and only launched radio and digital ads. THE BOLDUC-SUNUNU HUG THAT GRABBED NATIONAL ATTENTION Hassan, meanwhile, has built up a formidable war chest, and she holds an upper single-digit lead over Bolduc in an average of the most recent public opinion polls. While this is Bolduc\u2019s first TV ad, Hassan, along with the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, have already spent a combined $16.5 million to run spots since New Hampshire\u2019s Sept. 13 primary, according to AdImpact. And reservations show theHassan campaignplans to spend at least an additional $7.5 million through the election. Outside groups are also spending heavily in the small but important swing state. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As Fox News first reported a month ago, the Senate Leadership Fund said it would spend $23 million to buy TV time in New Hampshire to target Hassan during the general election campaign. The Senate Leadership Fund is the top pro-GOP super PAC in Senate races and is aligned with longtime GOP leader Mitch McConnell. Meanwhile, as first reported by Fox News last week, the Senate Majority PAC spent $3.7 million to launch its first ad against Bolduc. Senate Majority PAC is aligned with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the chamber.",

        " Black Lives Matter supporterRep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., defended her position of \"defunding the police\" in a GMA interview, claiming that critics get \"caught up on the words\" rather than understanding the whole narrative that \"police violence\" needs to be addressed. She argued that critics of the movement \"spend more time focusing on the word \u2018defund\u2019 than they spend on caring and addressing the problem of police violence.\" Bush defended the slogan while speaking to ABC \"Good Morning America\" anchor George Stephanopoulos in an interview Tuesday about her new book, \"The Forerunner.\" CHICAGO POLICE WILL DIVERT SOME COPS FROM NEIGHBORHOODS TO PROTECT MOVIE SETS: REPORT Stephanopoulos introduced the segment by mentioning how Bush\u2019s political career was born out of the aftermath of the Minneapolis police murder ofGeorge Floydin 2020. Of the incident, she said, \"First of all, it was a moment we didn\u2019t know was coming. You know? There was no playbook that said, \u2018Hey, if this happens in your community, do this.\u2019\" She added, \"I just stepped out on the streets during the protest as a nurse, as clergy, as someone of the community that just wanted to see justice happen.

        " \n        By\n        Chad Pergram   | Fox News ",
        " It\u2019s well known thatVice President Aaron Burrkilled Alexander Hamilton in a duel. But what few Americans know is that President Harry Trumanalsotook out Hamilton. Hamilton wasn\u2019t laid low in a duel. But congressional officials recently moved Hamilton\u2019s statue out of theCapitol rotundain exchange for a statue of the 33rd president. Hamilton\u2019s statue is now exiled to the Capitol\u2019s \"Hall of Columns,\" a lengthy, ornate corridor on the first floor of the House wing. Compared to the rotunda, the Hall of Columns is not exactly \"the room where it happens.\" WATCH: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF HARRY S. TRUMAN In the Hall of Columns, Hamilton\u2019s company isn\u2019t quite elite as the roster of presidents which line the rotunda. Hamilton\u2019s now in congressional steerage with a statue of Sen. Jacob Collamer of Vermont. Collamer was a prominent member of the Whig party and served as U.S. postmaster general. Nearby is a statue of Sen. John Kenna, D-W.V., who served in the Confederate Army. Finally, there\u2019s a depiction of John Gorrie of Florida. Gorrie\u2019s claim to fame is that he received a patent for a machine to make ice. That\u2019s one way to give Hamilton the cold shoulder. Alexander Hamilton enjoyed something of a renaissance in recent years thanks to Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s Broadway hit. But, as they sing in the musical, \"Oceans rise. Empires fall.\" And even Hamilton\u2019s recent surge in popularity was no match when up against Truman and a coveted spot in the Capitol rotunda. It\u2019s location, location, location \u2014 just like in real estate. Most spaces in the Capitol rotunda are reserved for presidents. George Washington. Thomas Jefferson. Abraham Lincoln. Andrew Jackson. Ulysses S. Grant. James Garfield. Dwight Eisenhower. Gerald Ford.Ronald Reagan. There are two exceptions. There\u2019s a bust ofMartin Luther King Jr.and a massive sculpture titled the \"Portrait to Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony.\" It\u2019s an homage to women\u2019s suffrage. But other than those figures, only the statues of presidents now stand in the rotunda. And as King George III proclaimed in Hamilton about other American presidents, \"Next to Washington, they all look small.\" Politics dictates there\u2019s no way they would remove King nor the women\u2019s monument. So they dismissed Hamilton. Each of the 50 states get to choose two statues to represent them in the Capitol collection. Missouri\u2019s legislature selected Truman as its statue, dispensing with an 1899 statue of late Sen. Thomas Hart Benton, D-Mo. Known as \"Old Bullion,\" Benton served in the Senate from 1821 to 1851. But the senator wasn\u2019t even as famous as the painter who bore the same name. Like many statues officials have replaced in the Capitol in recent years, history passed Benton by. Benton also defended slavery. So it\u2019s no surprise that the Show Me State showed Benton the door and opted for Truman. Benton\u2019s statue never stood in the Capitol rotunda. His depiction resided in Statuary Hall, the old House chamber. So they traded Benton for Truman and Hamilton for Truman. As they say in Major League Baseball, Hamilton was \"designated for assignment.\" And \u2014 click, boom \u2014 Hamilton was demoted from the Capitol rotunda to the Hall of Columns. Down in the Hall of Columns, Hamilton\u2019s edifice now stands next to a sculpture of late Sen. Pat McCarran, D-Nev. McCarran was a key figure in the creation of the U.S. Air Force. The airport in Las Vegas was named after McCarran until recently. Nevada officials renamed the airport after late Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. McCarran co-authored the famous \"McCarran-Ferguson Act.\" The law created a carve out for insurance firms from federal regulations. But McCarran was also a notorious racist. There\u2019s been chatter for years about swapping out McCarran\u2019s statue. Despite his downgrade, the 1868 statue of Hamilton might tell you he\u2019s not \"throwing away my shot,\" much like the title character in the play. LONG-MISSING ALEXANDER HAMILTON LETTER PUT ON PUBLIC DISPLAY Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., hinted he\u2019d like to see Hamilton back in the rotunda. The New York Democrat conferred with Senate Rules Committee Chairwoman Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., about the decision to switch out Hamilton for Truman. The Senate Rules Committee is one panel in charge of placement of statues in the Capitol. There\u2019s a line in the musical that is prophetic about Hamilton and the other Founding Fathers. It speaks to Hamilton\u2019s relegation on Capitol Hill. \"You have no control. Who lives who dies. Who tells your story,\" the chorus sings. The hagiography of Washington, Jefferson and James Madison overshadowed Hamilton \u2014 especially since Aaron Burr cut his life short in the duel. Despite his presence on the $10 bill, Hamilton was banished to the back pages of U.S. history until Ron Chernow authored his biography in 2004. Miranda magnified Hamilton\u2019s legacy from there with his Tony-winning musical in 2015. But Hamilton\u2019s most prominent place in the American political experience wasat the verycenterof the American political experience: the Capitol rotunda. Until now. Truman\u2019s status as president certainly makes him worthy of his spot in the rotunda. Truman may be more connected to the Capitol than some of his colleagues. He served a decade inthe Senateand \u2014 as President Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s vice president \u2014 was president of the Senate. In fact, Truman went from the Senate to vice president to president in fewer than three months after FDR died. Vice presidents frequently presided over daily Senate sessions back in those days. Truman spent much of April 12, 1945 monitoring a Senate debate over a water treaty with Mexico. Toward the end of the afternoon, Truman wandered to a special hideaway office in the Capitol used by House Speaker Sam Rayburn, D-Tex. Rayburn often invited fellow lawmakers to join him in what was called the \"Board of Education.\" They\u2019d discuss legislation over libations. Truman was Rayburn\u2019s guest on that day. ButWhite House press secretary Steve Earlyinterrupted their branch water and bourbon with an urgent phone call, asking Truman to return to the White House as quickly as possible. Truman didn\u2019t know why at the time. FDR had died and Truman was minutes away from becoming president. TEXAS CHURCH TO PAY DAMAGES FOR UNAUTHORIZED 'HAMILTON' PRODUCTION THAT ADDED RELIGIOUS THEMES Truman excused himself from the conclave with Rayburn and darted back across the building from the House wing to the vice president\u2019s office on the Senate side of the Capitol. Truman had to collect his hat before he could leave. It was rare in the 1940s to see a man outside without his hat.Ironically,en route to the Senate wing of the Capitol, Truman raced through the Hall of Columns and the very spot where Hamilton\u2019s statue stands today. Truman\u2019s oldest grandson, Clifton Truman Daniel, spoke at the ceremony dedicating the statue of his grandfather in the rotunda. \"Do your duty and history will do you justice,\" Daniel said. It\u2019s unclear if Hamilton\u2019s downgrade to the Hall of Columns is permanent.

        " A group of alumni from the University of California Hastings College of the Law and descendants of its namesake, Serranus Hastings, filed a lawsuit against the state and the school Tuesday in response toGov. Gavin Newsomsigning a bill that authorized changing the school\u2019s name. Hastings, aCalifornia Supreme Court Justice, founded the school in 1878, but some historians allege he was complicit in the killings of Native Americans. On Sept. 30, Newsom, a Democrat, signed AB 1936, which was sponsored by Assemblymember James C. Ramos. The bill redesignates the University of California\u2019s Hastings of the Law as the College of the Law,San Francisco. The law also outlined several \"restorative justice initiatives\" for Round Valley Indian Tribes and Yuki people whose ancestors \u2013according to Newsom's office\u2013 \"suffered mass killings and other atrocities funded and supported by college founder Serranus Hastings in the mid-19th century.\" AFTER 40 YEARS OF ENROLLING MEN, MISSISSIPPI UNIVERSITY FOR WOMEN CONSIDERS NAME CHANGE Tuesday\u2019s lawsuit was brought by the Dhillon Law Group and Michael Yamamoto LLP, in conjunction with the Center for American Liberty on behalf of Hastings\u2019 descendants and the UC Hastings Conservation Committee. The lawsuit disputes AB 1936\u2019s portrayal of Hastings, saying there is no direct evidence of him committing atrocities against Native Americans. \"Hastings, a lifelong Democrat, was\u00a0a giant in\u00a0California\u00a0history, our first California Chief Justice,\u00a0and like\u00a0many founding figures, is the latest victim of activists rewriting history to fit a contemporary agenda,\u00a0with\u00a0scant factual basis, no due process, and the ends justifying the means,\" said Harmeet K. Dhillon, CEO of the Center for American Liberty,\u00a0in a statement. \"In his time, Hastings was a\u00a0civil rights\u00a0leader\u00a0and\u00a0neither\u00a0he, nor his descendants or the graduates of this fine institution,\u00a0deserve the smear job orchestrated by\u00a0politicians for their own purposes,\" the statement continued. The lawsuit alleges that the name change breaches an agreement between the State of California and Hastings, when he gave it $100,000 in gold to establish the school. Per the agreement, Hastings would serve as its inaugural dean, an heir or representative would always hold a seat on the school\u2019s board of directors, and it would forever be called the \"Hastings College of the Law,\" according to the lawsuit. In a statement to Fox News, the law school said it was aware of the lawsuit and was \"disappointed\" by the plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to prevent the name change, \"which was made official through AB 1936 without any no votes in the state Assembly and Senate \"The bill\u2019s passage was the result of a lengthy, deliberate and transparent process at the College that included years of thoughtful research, several public hearings and input from a wide range of community stakeholders,\" the law school said. \"The College remains committed to moving forward with the name change, and to continuing our restorative justice efforts with the support of the campus community.\" Fox News has reached out to Ramos\u2019 office for comment.

        " TheSupreme Court's conservative majorityappeared ready Tuesday to uphold Alabama's GOP-friendly congressional map, in an important voting rights case that could major implications in the 2024 race and beyond. In a tense nearly two-hour oral argument, the state argued it was taking a \"race-neutral\" approach in creating voting boundaries, and that it should not be forced to sort voters by race. But theBiden administration and civil rights groupstold the justices not to weaken enforcement of a key provision in the landmark Voting Rights Act. The state's redistricting plan is being challenged after the redrawn map continued having just one\u00a0of its seven congressional districts where racial minorities form a majority of voters, even though statewide, there is a 27% Black population. SUPREME COURT ON TUESDAY TO HEAR DEBATE ON ALLEGED RACIAL GERRYMANDERING IN ALABAMA REDISTRICTING PLAN A federal district court said the state could have drawn a second majority-minority district using traditional\u00a0redistricting criteria. But the Supreme Court in February issued a preliminary order, allowing the state for now to use its maps for the 2022 midterm elections, which were enacted by a Republican-led legislature. The justices also put on hold a similar effort to add a second Black majority district in Louisiana in time for November's races. Alabama's current congressional delegationhas only one Black representative \u2014 Terri Sewell (D)\u2014 from the only Black-majority district. The three-judge federal judicial panel had concluded the existing map drawn based on the 2020 census likely violated the Voting Rights Act and diluting the voting power of minority voters \u2014 by squeezing Black voters into one congressional district, then spreading out other Black voters across the state to make it more difficult for minorities to elect the candidate of their choice. Section Two of the VRA, the provision at issue here, bans a state from voting practices that \"result in a denial or abridgment of the right to vote on account of race or color,\" and that election rules must be \"equally open.\" In oral arguments, the newest Justice Ketanji Brown\u00a0Jackson dominated the debate, persistently questioning Alabama Solicitor General Edmund LaCour's positions. She suggested black voters were being compacted into a single black-minority district. Federal intervention happens when \"people are continuing to vote in racially blocked ways, but if that stopped happening, if what we all want, which would be people to spread out and live among one another and vote based on their, own views as opposed to along racial lines, then we wouldn't have a Section 2 violation. Is that correct?\" Jackson said that was not what was happening in Alabama. Justice Elena Kagan talked in broader terms, saying, \"In recent years, the\u00a0[Voting Rights Act] statute has fared not well in this court.\" She told LaCour, \u00a0\"You're asking us essentially to cut back substantially on our 40 years of precedent and to make this too extremely difficult to prevail on. So what's left?\" The conservative justices by comparison asked few questions of counsel. Justice Clarence Thomas, one of two Black members on the court posed just one query, while Justice Neil Gorsuch was silent throughout. But Justice Samuel Alito\u00a0strongly questioned theBiden Justice Department's stance, saying some states would never be able to satisfy the demands of those seeking to maximize minority voting power. \"Will not the plaintiffs always run the table? Where can they [the challenged states] win?\" asked Alito. \"They're not going to win on whether the minority group is politically cohesive. They're not going to win on whether the majority votes as a bloc, which may be due to ideology and not have anything to do with race. It may be that Black voters and white voters prefer different candidates now because they have different ideas about what the government should do.\" POPULAR PARODY WEBSITE FILES AMICUS BRIEF LACED WITH SATIRE TO THE SUPREME COURT Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett could prove key to the outcome. They asked tough questions of both sides, and their comments suggested that while they may ultimately side with Alabama, they may be inclined to preserve key parts of Section Two of the VRA. The high court in recent years has weakened parts of the Voting Rights Act dealing with enforcement of alleged violations over minority voting power. The court next month will hear another important voting rights case, testing whether state courts had improperly taken powers given by the U.S. Constitution to state lawmakers governing federal elections and congressional redistricting. It involves achallenge by North Carolina Republicansto a state court ruling that threw out the congressional districts drawn by the General Assembly, making GOP candidates likely victors in 10 of the state's 14 congressional districts. The high court is now being asked to invoke the \"independent state legislature doctrine\" for the first time. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Backers of ISL say Article 1 of the Constitution \u2014 notably the \"Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof\" \u2014 gives state legislatures sole authority to regulate federal elections, without oversight by state courts or state constitutions. The consolidated Alabama cases are Merrill v. Milligan (21-1086) and Merrill v. Caster (21-1087). A ruling is expected later this term, well after November's congressional elections.",

    "Trump, McConnell, extreme insults and a climate violence": [
        " \n        By\n        Howard Kurtz   | Fox News ",
        " In a world in which the SEC charges Kim Kardashian with promoting a crypto brand on Instagram without disclosing she was paid $250,000, we are constantly confronted with instances ofcelebrities behaving badly. In a world in which politicians use crude attacks to build their brand \u2013 Marjorie Taylor Greene has already filed impeachment resolutions against President Biden and uses them to raise money \u2013 we\u2019ve become inured to a culture of demonization. The media have for years helped foster this climate, where only increasingly extreme denunciations break through the static. It was hardly inventedby Donald Trump. But Trump seized the moment with his mastery of the news cycle, using rallies and Twitter (and now Truth Social) to bash and belittle his political foes, often counterpunching against denunciations by them or the fourth estate. Any Republicans who fought him were labeled RINOs and many were knocked off in primaries, leaving a party in which the former president remains the dominant figure. WHEN A MAJOR HURRICANE COLLIDES WITH OTHER NEWS, THE STORM PREVAILS So dominant, in fact, that amajority of Republicanstell pollsters they believe Trump\u2019s continued claims that the 2020 election was stolen, which much of the rest of the country and the vast majority of the media dismiss as a big lie. The Justice Department\u2019s investigation of the ex-president for taking and withholding classified documents only convinces his supporters that the establishment is out to get him. Trump has beenattacking Mitch McConnellever since the senator broke with him in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 riot. He has called the Republican leader some version of an \"Old Crow\" so many times that nobody blinks anymore. So the man who privately called his own supporters \"f------ crazy,\" according to Maggie Haberman\u2019s book, escalated even more. He started out accusing McConnell of approving trillions in Democrat-sponsored bills because \"he hates Donald J. Trump\" or wants to \"take the Country down with him.\" (Perhaps McConnell thought infrastructure, computer chips and helping ailing veterans was a good idea?) \"He has a DEATH WISH. Must immediately seek help and advise [sic] from his China loving wife, Coco Chow!\" Now I was more offended by the obvious racist reference to Mitch\u2019s wife Elaine Chao, who was Trump\u2019s own Transportation secretary. Her crime was that she resigned immediatelyafter Jan. 6.Still: Chow? I didn\u2019t see the death wish part as an attempt to stir up violence, but many people disagree. I viewed it more as Trump trolling one of his favorite targets, and am not sure whether the media should take the bait. Does every over-the-top insult need to be covered? The Wall Street Journal\u2019s conservative editorial page, which supported many of his presidential initiatives but has been tough on his post-White House conduct, disagrees: \"The \u2018death wish\u2019 rhetoric is ugly even by Mr. Trump\u2019s standards and deserves to be condemned. Mr. Trump\u2019s apologists claim he merely meant Mr. McConnell has a political death wish, but that isn\u2019t what he wrote. It\u2019s all too easy to imagine some fanatic taking Mr. Trump seriously and literally, and attempting to kill Mr. McConnell. Many supporters took Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric aboutformer Vice President Mike Penceall too seriously on Jan. 6.\" Fair point; there are plenty of crazy people out there. The editorial doesn\u2019t stop there: \"Five weeks from Election Day, Mr. Trump could be working and spending money to elect a GOP Congress or to help his home state ofFlorida recover from Hurricane Ian.Instead he\u2019s attacking Mr. McConnell and his wife as part of a personal political vendetta, and putting every Republican candidate on the spot to respond to questions about the Trump rant. Mr. Trump always puts himself first, and with this rhetoric he may put others at genuine risk of harm.\" Even if he meant political death wish, it\u2019s ambiguous enough that it could be interpreted that way. (McConnell makes a general practice of not commenting on Trump.) MEDIA DISMISS TRUMP-BACKED NOMINEES AS LOSERS, BUT MANY REMAIN COMPETITIVE The New York Times ties the Trump era to a tenfold increase in threats against members of Congress: \"In Bangor, Maine, an unknown visitor smashed a storm window at Senator Susan Collins\u2019s home. \"In Seattle, a man who had sent an angry email to Representative Pramila Jayapal repeatedly showed up outside the lawmaker\u2019s house, armed with a semiautomatic handgun and shouting threats and profanities.\" SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF ON THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES Collins told the paper that \"I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if a senator or House member were killed.\" The media were far less concerned when an armed manthreatening to kill Brett Kavanaughtraveled to within a block of his Maryland home (before providing the tip that prompted police to arrest him). The Biden administration never explicitly denounced this. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And we only have to go back to 2017 to recall the unhinged liberal who shot up a Republican baseball practice in Virginia, seriously wounding GOP Whip Steve Scalise. So things are ugly out there. Whatever Trump had in mind with McConnell and Chao, it wasn\u2019t exactly a high-minded appeal to our better angels. Footnote: Despite granting New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman three lengthy interviews for her book and referring to her as his \"psychiatrist,\" Trump has escalated his rhetoric since \"Confidence Man\" came out. First he called her a \"self-appointed head case\" and a \"creep.\" Now she\u2019s \"Maggot Haberman\" and \"a bad writer with very bad sources!\" Haberman, who engaged in extensive fact-checking with Trump, said in the book she\u2019s accustomed to his alternating cycles of positivity and name-calling.",

        " Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg was pressed oncomments from Vice President Kamala Harristhat critics said suggested Hurricane Ian relief aid be delegated based on factors other than purely loss claims. Harris had said that \"it is our lowest-income communities and our communities of color that are most impacted by these extreme conditions\u2026 We have to address this in a way that is about giving resources based on equity, understanding that we fight for equality, but we also need to fight for equity.\" On \"Your World\" Tuesday, Buttigieg was asked about those remarks as his own department seeks to help in the arduous task of rebuilding vital infrastructure like the destroyed Sanibel Island Causeway \u2013 the sole link between the popular island and Punta Rassa, Fla., on the mainland. In response, the secretarysaid every claimant's case is indeed different, in terms of light home damage versus a destroyed dwelling, or residents asking for relief when their neighborhood was \"completely cut off from resources\" versus one that is still accessible.

And that's something that I think you see built into the process right now,\" he said. Host Neil Cavuto pressed further, pointing to private aid groups like Samaritan's Purse taking issue with Harris. Rev. Franklin Graham, who leads the global organization, said hurricane victims are all victims in the end. \"A person that lost a roof, that may have a big house, another person lost a roof, maybe a small house, they still both lost their roofs and their contents are getting wet. They're being destroyed, and they need help,\" Graham said.

And of course, we recognize that there are many Americans who were vulnerable the day the storm hit. They're even more vulnerable now.\" \"And we've got to make sure we take care of them and take care of everybody to get them back on their feet.\" A proponent of the Biden administration's green automobile transition vision, Buttigieg also later pushed back on continued criticisms from the right on the viability of moving on to electric vehicles nationwide.

At a Michigan rally headlined by Donald Trump, Greene praised the \"roar of a V8 engine\" while contrasting such a dynamic with that of electric vehicles touted by Buttigieg. She further claimed the Biden administration wants to shutter Detroit's automobile sector. Buttigieg grimaced at Greene's quote, remarking he \"literally do[es]n't understand what that means.\" \"My sense of manhood is not connected to whether my vehicle is fueled by gasoline or whether it's fueled by electricity,\" he added. \"To be honest, there are other members of Congress that I pay more attention to when I'm thinking about opinions that really matter or ideas that are going to be critical to engage with.\"",

    "Walker report puts abortion back at center of Georgia race": [
        "By BILL BARROWOctober 4, 2022 GMT",
        " ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 In Georgia\u2019s pivotal U.S. Senate race, Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and his Republicanchallenger, Herschel Walker, have each been laboring to cast the other as an extremist on abortion while deflecting questions about the finer points of their own positions. The sidestepping by Warnock, who supports abortion rights, and Walker, who has called for a national ban, reflects the sensitivity of abortion politics in a post-Roe v. Wade America, where the procedure is open to regulation by state governments and,potentially, by Congress. But Walker\u2019s strategy may not work much longer afterThe Daily Beast reported Mondaythat the former University of Georgia and NFL football star encouraged and paid for a girlfriend\u2019s abortion in 2009 \u2014 a blatant contradiction of his staunch claims that there\u2019s \u201cno excuse\u201d for a procedure he characterizes as \u201ckilling.\u201d Walker calls the report a \u201cflat-out lie.\u201d The story propelled the issue of abortion back to the center of the race in the closing weeks of the campaign \u2014 and just ahead ofthe candidates\u2019 Oct. 14 debate. The contest is one of the most consequential in the country this midterm season and could determine which party controls the Senate for the second half of President Joe Biden\u2019s first term in office. Abortion is an issue in other Senate races as well, including Colorado, Florida and North Carolina. The Daily Beast interviewed a woman who identified herself as a former girlfriend of Walker\u2019s and asked that her name not be disclosed out of concerns for her privacy. She provided a receipt indicating she had paid $575 for an abortion, as well as a get-well card from Walker and bank deposit records showing the image of a $700 personal check from Walker dated five days after the abortion receipt. At the least, the report complicates Walker\u2019s effort to use abortion as an issue against Warnock. And it underscores the sometimes-delicate task that confronts other candidates from both major parties who hope to use the issue ahead of the midterm elections. For decades under Roe, Republicans like Walker were able to call themselves \u201cpro-life\u201d and blast \u201cabortion on demand,\u201d perhaps even expressing support for absolute or near-total bans that federal courts were certain to strike down. Democrats, meanwhile, could oppose such Republican efforts as draconian. All sides knew it it would be the Supreme Court, not them, making any ultimate decision. But with the high court in Juneoverturning the 1973 decision legalizing abortion nationwide, the issue has become one of the animating variables of the 2022 midterm campaigns. Themost conservative anti-abortion groups want a national ban, with some going so far as to oppose even exceptions in cases involving rape, incest or health risks to a pregnant woman. Abortion rights group, meanwhile, are reticent to back any limits on abortion access, including later in pregnancy. As a whole, Americans have nuanced views on abortion, though a clear majority support at least some access. A July AP-NORC pollshowed 63% of U.S. adults said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 36% thought it should be illegal in all or most cases. Some 31% said always legal, just 9% illegal in all cases. That leaves politicians to navigate varied opinions across a big swath of Democrats, Republicans and independents. Walker has questioned how Warnock, a pastor, could support abortion rights. \u201cGod told me thou shalt not kill,\u201d he is fond of saying, referring to one of the Ten Commandments in Judeo-Christian holy texts. At a campaign stop in July, he said of Warnock: \u201cWhy is he saying you can have an abortion at nine months?\u201d Why does he \u201cwant to have a young woman kill her baby?\u201d Warnock, for his part, told voters as recently as Monday night that he has both \u201ca profound reverence for life\u201d and \u201can abiding respect for choice,\u201d declaring the government does not belong in a patient\u2019s room. When questioned by reporters for more details, Warnock declines to engage on whether he\u2019d consider any abortion limits as part of reestablishing a national right. Asked last week whether he\u2019d support a federal bill codifying the previous Supreme Court standard \u2014 essentially allowing most elective abortions up to the point a fetus is viable, with states able to place some regulations even before then \u2014 Warnock said, \u201cI think that we\u2019ve got to explore all options to protect this core constitutional principle.\u201d Walker\u2019s clearest support for a total federal abortion ban came when he was running for the GOP Senate nomination. He said \u201cthere\u2019s no exception in my mind\u201d that should allow women to terminate pregnancies resulting from rape or incest or those that threaten their life or health. Last month, however, he endorsed aproposal from Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., to ban abortions nationwideat 15 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions. The support for Graham\u2019s proposal was inconsistent with his previous stance that states should set abortion rules. A 15-week ban also would still allow many elective abortions that conservative anti-abortion groups want to outlaw. Republicans in Washington have not necessarily embraced Graham\u2019s proposal as the party standard. Sen. Rick Scott, the Florida Republican who leads his party\u2019s Senate campaign committee, tried last weekend on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d to leave wiggle room for GOP candidates. \u201cI don\u2019t know if what Lindsey put out changed the conversation, but it is an important issue for the country,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery candidate gets to make their choice.\u201d Scott then illuminated the gray areas in how partisans identify on abortion. He called himself \u201cpro-life\u201d but added that \u201cwe ought to have a reasonable restriction\u201d and that \u201ca lot of people are comfortable with 15 weeks\u201d plus \u201cexceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother.\u201d Democrats, meanwhile, have largely been eager to keep abortion front of mind heading into the midterms. Biden has promised to codify abortion rights into federal law, saying he needs voters to send two more Democratic senators to Washington to make it happen. Warnock and Walker are not the only Senate candidates walking a tightrope on abortion. Scott\u2019s Florida colleague, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, touts his personal opposition to abortion in all cases but has also said he\u2019d back abortion-restricting statutes that include exceptions. Rubio also has avoided taking a specific stance on any federal restrictions, saying the issue is more appropriately settled state-by-state. Rubio\u2019s opponent, Rep. Val Demings, has said she supports abortion access at least until fetal viability and said physicians should determine viability. In North Carolina, Republican nominee Ted Budd, like Walker, has expressed opposition to abortion in nearly all cases but also endorsed Graham\u2019s proposal. His opponent, Democrat Cheri Beasley, has said she would support the Roe standard as the rubric for a federal law \u2014 a move that could still allow some state-level restrictions. In Colorado, Republican Joe O\u2019Dea is therare GOP candidate who has spoken out in favor of abortion rights. Trying to pull off an upset against Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet in the liberal-leaning state, O\u2019Dea has called for \u201cbalance\u201d and said abortion should be legal up to 20 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions beyond that in cases of rape, incest and health risks to a woman. That roughly tracks the Supreme Court standard before Roe. He has opposed Graham\u2019s abortion ban proposal, though Bennet has countered by noting that O\u2019Dea has said he would have voted to confirm President Donald Trump\u2019s three Supreme Court nominees, all of whom voted to scrap Roe.",

    "Justices mull latest challenge to landmark voting rights law": [
        "By MARK SHERMANOctober 4, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority appeared open Tuesday to making it harder to create majority Black electoral districts, in anAlabama casethat could have far-reaching effects on minority voting power across the United States. The justices heard two hours of argumentsin the latest showdown over the federalVoting Rights Act, with lawsuits seeking to force Alabama to create a second Black majority congressional district. About 27% of Alabamians are Black, but they form a majority in just one of the state\u2019s seven congressional districts. The court\u2019s conservatives, in a 5-4 vote in February, blocked a lower court rulingthat would have required a second Black majority district in time for the November elections. A similar ruling to create an additional Black majority district in Louisiana also was put on hold. Conservative high-court majorities have made it harder for racial minorities to use the Voting Rights Act in ideologically divided rulings in2013and2021. A ruling for Alabama in the new case could weaken a powerful tool that civil rights groups and minority voters have used to challenge racial discrimination in redistricting. Some conservative justices seemed sympathetic to Alabama\u2019s arguments that the court should insist on a \u201crace-neutral\u201d approach to redistricting and should make it harder for people claiming racial discrimination in voting to clear an early legal hurdle. Against pushback from Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson and the other liberal justices, Justice Samuel Alito said it\u2019s too easy for people suing over discrimination in redistricting to win because the first bar in the legal test is too low \u2014 simply showing that another political district could be drawn in which minority residents make up a majority of voters. In practice, Alito said, \u201cwill not the plaintiffs always run the table?\u201d The outcome appears to rest with Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh. Their questions suggested they may be open to a more narrow win for Alabama than the broadest outcome the state is asking for, which might even allow states to dismantle existing districts where racial minorities make up more than half the voters. Even the state\u2019s \u201cleast far-reaching argument,\u201d as Alito put it, would result in many fewer districts drawn to give racial minorities the opportunity to elect their candidates of choice, the court\u2019s three liberal justices said. Jackson, the court\u2019s first Black female justice who was hearing her second day of arguments, disagreed with arguments made by Alabama\u2019s lawyer, Edmund LaCour Jr., that redistricting has to be done without regard to race. Constitutional amendments adopted after the Civil War were intended to give a \u201cconstitutional foundation for a piece of legislation that was designed to make people who had less opportunity and less rights equal to white citizens,\u201d Jackson said. The Voting Rights Act \u201cby its plain text is doing that same thing.\u201d Justice Elena Kagan referred to the Voting Rights Act as not only \u201can important statute\u201d but \u201cone of the great achievements of American democracy\u201d while acknowledging that recent Supreme Court cases have cut back on the law. \u201cNow, in recent years, the statute has fared not well in this court,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re asking us essentially to cut back substantially on our 40 years of precedent and to make this, too, extremely difficult to prevail on, so what\u2019s left?\u201d Kagan said to LaCour. Partisan politics underlies the case. Republicans who dominate elective office in Alabama have been resistant to creating a second district with a Democratic-leaning Black majority that could send another Democrat to Congress. Two appointees of President Donald Trump were on the three-judge panel that unanimously held that Alabama likely violated the landmark 1965 law by diluting Black voting strength. The judges found that Alabama has concentrated Black voters in one district, while spreading them out among the others to make it impossible for them to elect a candidate of their choice. Alabama\u2019s Black population is large enough and geographically compact enough to create a second district, the judges found. Alabama argues that the lower court ruling would force it to sort voters by race and the state insists it is taking a \u201crace neutral\u201d approach to redistricting. That argument could resonate with conservative justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts. He has opposed most consideration of race in voting both as a justice and in his time as a lawyer in Republican presidential administrations. Roberts said little Tuesday to telegraph his vote. Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch also had little or nothing to say in court, but Thomas in particular has voted consistently to limit the reach of anti-discrimination laws. The arguments were the first Supreme Court case involving race for Jackson. A challenge to affirmative action in college admissions is set for arguments on Oct. 31. A decision in Merrill v. Milligan is expected by late June. ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court",

    "Biden consults Japan PM Kishida after N. Korea missile test": [
        "By AAMER MADHANIOctober 4, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden on Tuesday spoke with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to discuss their next steps afterNorth Korea conducted its longest ever test launchby firing a nuclear-capable ballistic missile over Japan. The White House in a statement said the leaders condemned North Korea\u2019s missile test in the \u201cstrongest terms, recognizing the launch as a danger to the Japanese people, destabilizing to the region, and a clear violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions.\u201d The White House said the leaders agreed to coordinate an immediate and longer-term response together, as well as with South Korea, and with the international community. They also vowed to work to limit North Korea\u2019s \u201cability to support its unlawful ballistic missile and weapons of mass destruction programs.\u201d North Korea has test-fired about 40 missiles over about 20 different launch events this year as its leader, Kim Jong Un, refuses to return to nuclear diplomacy with the United States, but Tuesday\u2019s test was the most provocative yet. Tuesday\u2019s launch is the fifth round of weapons tests by North Korea in the past 10 days. The testing spree is an apparent response to two sets of military drills -- one between Washington and Seoul and the other involving Washington, Seoul and Tokyo -- off the Korean Peninsula\u2019s east coast last week. Earlier, Biden\u2019s national security adviser Jake Sullivan spoke with his counterparts, Japanese Secretary General Akiba Takeo and South Korea National Security Office Director Kim Sung-han, to discuss the North Korean provocation. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to detail potential responses being weighed but underscored that administration officials stood ready to hold talks with North Korea without preconditions. The administration has repeatedly appealed to the North through backchannels but Pyongyang has been unresponsive. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that the DPRK has not responded to our outreach,\u201d she said. Biden and Kishida also discussed the cases of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea, according to the White House. Biden administration officials have become increasingly concerned about North Korea efforts to provoke the U.S. and its Pacific allies. Last month, the Biden administration declassified a U.S. intelligence finding that showed believe that the Russians werelooking to purchase North Korean military equipmentfor its fight in Ukraine. North Korea has also sought to tighten relations with Russia as much of Europe and the West has pulled away, blaming the United States for the Ukraine crisis and decrying the West\u2019s \u201chegemonic policy\u201d as justifying military action by Russia in Ukraine to protect itself. The North Koreans have hinted interest in sending construction workers to help rebuild Russian-occupied territories in the country\u2019s east.",

    "Oath Keepers founder: Be \u2018ready to fight\u2019 after Trump loss": [
        "By ALANNA DURKIN RICHER and LINDSAY WHITEHURSTOctober 4, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Hours after Joe Biden was declared the winner of the 2020 presidential election, the leader of the Oath Keepers extremist group was discussing how to push President Donald Trump to go further in his fight to cling to power, according to messages shown to jurors Tuesdayin his U.S. Capitol attack trial. Prosecutors usedStewart Rhodes\u2019messages and recordings of him speaking from November 2020 to try to show that he had been working behind the scenes for two months to try to stop the transfer of presidential power before his followers attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Rhodes and four associates are facing charges of seditious conspiracy for what authorities allege was adetailed, drawn-out plot to keep Biden out of the White Housethat included putting armed teams on standby outside of Washington. Tuesday was the first full day of testimony in the high-stakes case that\u2019s expected to last several weeks. The five defendants are the first people arrested in the Jan. 6 attack to stand trial forseditious conspiracy\u2014 a rarely used Civil War-era charge that can be difficult to prove. Rhodes\u2019 attorneys have said their defense will focus on Rhodes\u2019 belief that Trump was going to invoke the Insurrection Act and call up the militia to support his bid to stay in power. The messages were revealed during testimony of an FBI agent investigating the insurrection. In several messages sent around Nov. 7, 2020 \u2014 the day that The Associated Press and other news outlets called the election for Biden \u2014 Rhodes pressed others to refuse to accept the results and \u201cbend the knee\u201d to what he saw as an illegitimate administration. In one message, Rhodes urged his followers to get their \u201cget your gear squared away\u201d and be \u201cready to fight.\u201d In another \u2014 sent to a group called \u201cFOS\u201d or \u201cFriends of Stone\u201d that included Trump ally Roger Stone \u2014 Rhodes urged his fellow Oath Keepers to think of the ways early Americans had resisted the British. \u201cWe are now where the founders were in March, 1775,\u201d he wrote. He implored them to \u201cstep up and push Trump to finally take decisive action.\u201d \u201cThe final defense is us and our rifles,\u201d Rhodes wrote to the group. \u201cTrump has one last chance, right now, to stand. But he will need us and our rifles too.\u201d The evening of Nov. 9, Rhodes held a conference call with more than 100 of his followers to discuss the plan. It was secretly recorded by someone on the call and sent to the FBI. Rhodes urged people on the call to go to Washington and let Trump know that \u201cthe people are behind him,\u201d according to a recording played to jurors. Rhodes expressed hope that left-wing antifa activists would start clashes because that would give Trump the \u201creason and rationale for dropping the Insurrection Act.\u201d \u201cSo we have a chance to get President Trump to fight as Commander in Chief. If you\u2019re going to have a fight, guys, you want to start now while he\u2019s still Commander in Chief,\u201d Rhodes told the group. Rhodes said they would have some of their \u201cbest men bolstered up outside\u201d \u2014 or \u201cquick reaction forces\u201d that he said would be \u201cawaiting the president\u2019s orders.\u201d It needed to be that way because that gives you \u201clegal cover,\u201d Rhodes said on the call. Rhodes\u2019 attorney sought to show that prosecutors are cherry-picking messages from hundreds of chats on his phone. Defense attorney Phillip Linder pressed the FBI agent over whether he ever saw Rhodes encourage anybody to do anything illegal before prosecutors objected to the question. \u201cAll we have is bombastic language,\u201d Linder said. Rhodes\u2019 lawyers have said they will argue that their client can\u2019t be guilty of seditious conspiracy because all of his actions were in anticipation of orders he expected were coming from Trump under the Insurrection Act. Even though Trump never did, Rhodes\u2019 lawyers say he was merely lobbying the president to invoke the law, which gives the president wide discretion to decide when military force is necessary, and what qualifies as military force. On trial with Rhodes, of Granbury, Texas, are Kelly Meggs, leader of the Florida chapter of the Oath Keepers; Kenneth Harrelson, another Florida Oath Keeper; Thomas Caldwell, a retired U.S. Navy intelligence officer from Virginia, and Jessica Watkins, who led an Ohio militia group. Prosecutors showed jurors several items found at Caldwell\u2019s home, including a notebook with writing about things like \u201ccomms\u201d and \u201clookouts.\u201d The FBI agent said that \u201cwas all indicative to us of some sort of an operation.\u201d Caldwell\u2019s attorney, David Fischer, pressed the agent on whether the government has any witnesses who claim Caldwell had a plan to attack the Capitol on Jan. 6.

    "EXPLAINER: Voting systems reliable, despite conspiracies": [
        "By CHRISTINA A. CASSIDYOctober 4, 2022 GMT",
        " ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Former President Donald Trump and his allies have whipped up a relentless campaign of attacks against voting equipment since his loss in the 2020 election. After nearly two years,no evidencehas emerged that voting machines were manipulated to steal the election or that there wasany widespread fraud. Conspiracy theories spread online and inforums across the countrynevertheless have undermined public confidence in voting machines and election results, while leadingsome countiesto consider ditching the equipment in favor of hand-marked andhand-counted ballots. Elections have been held across the country this year during a busy primary season. While programming errors sometimes occur and equipment can malfunction, no major problems have been reported. Voting equipment is tested before and after to identify any problems, while audits done after the election confirm it worked correctly. The Associated Press explains how we got to this point, the efforts to increase security of the vote and the fallout from the false claims surrounding the 2020 presidential election. VOTING TECHNOLOGY IN USE IN THE U.S. The types of voting equipment used throughout the U.S. varies by location. For in-person voting, most people fill out ballots by hand, and those ballots are inserted into an electronic tabulator. In many cases, this happens at the polling location. Elsewhere, the ballots are collected in a secured box, with rules governing the chain of custody, and taken to an election office for electronic tabulation. In some places, a specialized computer is used by voters to mark their ballots electronically. Those ballots are printed, reviewed by the voter for accuracy and then inserted into a tabulator at their polling location.A lawsuit in Georgiais challenging the use of these \u201cballot-marking\u201d machines because they use bar codes to record votes. Mailed ballots also are counted by tabulators at a local election office. A small number of jurisdictions, mostly small towns in New England, don\u2019t use tabulators and count their ballots by hand. HOW HAS THIS CHANGED OVER THE YEARS? After the\u201changing chad\u201d chaosof the 2000 election, Congress provided money for voting system upgrades. Many jurisdictions opted for electronic voting machines to replace their punch-card ballot systems. But those machines did not produce a paper record; instead, all votes were cast and recorded electronically. For years, election security experts raised concerns about these \u201cdirect-recording\u201d machines and the potential for someone to tamper with them. A more secure method, they say, is a system that uses paper ballots and electronic tabulation with post-election reviews and tests to ensure the machines faithfully recorded voters\u2019 choices. Over the last decade, state and local governments began replacing their paperless machines, a process that accelerated after the 2016 election and revelations thatRussia had scanned U.S. voting systemslooking for vulnerabilities. Today, paperless machines areused only in Louisianaand a small number of jurisdictions in Indiana, Mississippi, New Jersey, Tennessee and Texas, according to Verified Voting, a group that tracks voting technology in the U.S. CLAIMS MADE AFTER THE 2020 ELECTION In the weeks after the 2020 election, Trump and his allies made numerousunsupported claimsabout voting machines, including that their software was created in foreign countries and designed to flip votes for desired candidates: \u201cWith the turn of a dial or the change of a chip, you can press a button for Trump and it goes to Biden,\u201d Trump said in a Dec. 2 speech. These claims have largely centered on Dominion Voting Systems, one of a handful of companies that dominate the U.S. voting technology market. In response, Dominion has filed defamation lawsuits againstconservative media companiesand Trump lawyersSidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani, saying \u201clies and misinformation have severely damaged our company and diminished the credibility of U.S. elections.\u201d But rather than dissipate,conspiracies surrounding voting machineshave only grown. Trump allies have been traveling the country to speak at conferences and with community groups, armed with algorithms and charts purporting to show machines have somehow been rigged. Election technology expert Kevin Skoglund said part of the challenge is that voting systems are complex. It\u2019s understandable that some people would be persuaded that something nefarious happened when it did not. \u201cIf you are a person who is not technical, if someone is telling you the machines are cheating you, you might believe it because you don\u2019t understand how the systems work,\u201d Skoglund said. ARE VOTING SYSTEMS SECURE? Any device run by software -- a cell phone, a laptop or voting system -- is vulnerable to hacking. That\u2019s why election experts have been pressing for the replacement of paperless voting machines. Experts say the U.S. has taken steps to improve election security in recent years. That includes designating U.S. voting systems in 2017 as\u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d-- on par with the nation\u2019s banks, dams and nuclear power plants. Congress has sent nearly $900 million in election security funding to states, which has been used to replace outdated voting systems, hire cybersecurity staff and beef up cybersecurity defenses. \u201cThere is no such thing as an invulnerable system,\u201d said Larry Norden, an election security expert at the Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t do better. We should always be looking at how we can do better, but you can\u2019t eliminate risk.\u201d FALSE CLAIMS FUEL DOUBT AND SECURITY CONCERNS The false claims have not only undermined public confidence in elections. They also have led tosecurity breachesat some local election offices in Colorado, Georgia and Michigan. Soon after the 2020 election, Trump allies seized ona programming errorin a Michigan county and, through the courts, gained legal access to its voting system. But a copy of the county\u2019s election management system was made available at an August 2021 event hosted by a Trump ally, MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, according to attendees. Also released at that event was a copy of the system used inMesa County, Colorado.Details have surfaced recently of another suspected breach \u2014 inCoffee County, Georgiain January 2021 as Trump allies sought ways to overturn the result of the presidential election. And Michiganauthorities are investigatingafter voting equipment in a handful of counties was made accessible to unauthorized people. Those developments have prompted concerns thatrogue election workerssympathetic to conspiracies might use their access to election equipment and the knowledge to launch an attack from within. Apoll worker in Michiganwas recently charged with inserting a personal thumb drive into an electronic pollbook during the state\u2019s primary, whileauthorities in Coloradoare investigating a case in which a voter is suspected of tampering with a voting machine earlier this year. Jen Easterly, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency at the Department of Homeland Security, told reporters Monday that threats to the security of elections have never been more complex \u2014 citingmisinformation, the insider threats andharassment of election workers. THE \u201cMOST SECURE\u201d ELECTION After the 2020 presidential election, a coalition of federal cybersecurity and election officials along with state election officials and representatives from voting machine companies issued a statement calling itthe \u201cmost secure in American history.\u201d The group said there was \u201cno evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.\u201d This was due largely to paper records being available for an estimated 93% of all ballots cast and a system of post-election checks to test the accuracy of the electronic tabulators. In Georgia, the presidential vote was counted three times -- once entirely by hand -- and each tally affirmed President Joe Biden\u2019s win in the state. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what happens in the machine,\u201d said Norden, of the Brennan Center. \u201cWe have a piece of paper that tells us whether votes were recorded accurately.\u201d ___ Associated Press technology writer Frank Bajak in Lima, Peru, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP for full coverage of the midterms at https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections and on Twitter at https://twitter.com/ap_politics",

    "Herschel Walker paid for girlfriend\u2019s abortion, report says": [
        "By BILL BARROWOctober 4, 2022 GMT",
        " DUNWOODY, Ga. (AP) \u2014Herschel Walker, who has vehemently opposed abortion rights as the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Georgia, paid for an abortion for his girlfriend in 2009, according to anew report.The candidate called the accusation a \u201cflat-out lie\u201d and said he would sue. The Daily Beast spoke to the former girlfriend, who asked that her name not be used out of concerns for her privacy. In the report published late Monday, the news outlet said it reviewed a receipt showing her $575 payment for the procedure, along with a get-well card from Walker and her bank deposit records showing the image of a $700 personal check from Walker dated five days after the abortion receipt. The woman said Walker encouraged her to end the pregnancy, saying that the time wasn\u2019t right for a baby, The Daily Beast reported. As a candidate, Walker has characterized abortion as \u201ca woman killing her baby\u201d and has played up his opposition to the procedure in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling earlier this year stripping a woman\u2019s constitutional right to access abortion services. In a statement, Walker said he would file a lawsuit against The Daily Beast on Tuesday morning. \u201cThis is a flat-out lie \u2014 and I deny this in the strongest terms possible,\u201d he wrote. As of late Tuesday afternoon, Walker had not taken any legal action, according to a campaign spokesman. Matt Fuller, the politics editor for The Daily Beast, tweeted in response to Walker\u2019s initial denial: \u201cI can tell you we stand behind every word and feel very solid about the story.\u201d Later Monday night, Walker appeared on Sean Hannity\u2019s program on Fox News, where Walker was asked if he recalled sending a $700 check to a girlfriend. \u201cWell, I sent money to a lot of people,\u201d he said. \u201cI give money to people all the time because I\u2019m always helping people. I believe in being generous. God has blessed me. I want to bless others.\u201d Former President Donald Trump, who encouraged Walker to run for Senate, said Walker was being \u201cslandered and maligned.\u201d \u201cHerschel has properly denied the charges against him, and I have no doubt he is correct,\u201d Trump said in a statement. Walker and Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock are engaged in a tight contest that is key to the balance of power in the U.S. Senate. The chamber is now divided 50-50, with Vice President Kamala Harris holding the tie-breaking vote to give Democrats control. Warnock won the seat in a special election runoff on Jan. 5, 2021, prevailing by 2 percentage points over then-Sen. Kelly Loeffler, a Republican. The allegation against Walker is the latest in a series of stories about the football legend\u2019s past that has rocked the first-time candidate\u2019s campaign in one of the most competitive Senate races in the country. Earlier this year, Walkeracknowledged reports that he had three children he had not previously talked about publicly. Walker has often boasted of his work helping service members and veterans struggling with mental health. Yet The Associated Press reported in May that various records showed heoverstated his role in a for-profit programthat is alleged to have preyed upon veterans and service members while defrauding the government. The AP also has reported thata review of public recordsdetailed accusations that Walker repeatedly threatened his ex-wife\u2019s life, exaggerated claims of financial success and alarmed business associates with unpredictable behavior. Walker himself has at times discussed his long struggle with mental illness. Republicans targeted Warnock as perhaps the most vulnerable of the Democratic Senate incumbents. But they were also skeptical about Walker\u2019s viability as a statewide candidate, especially through the spring and summer as Walker\u2019s past was aired publicly. In recent months, Walker found his footing by attacking Warnock for backing President Joe Biden\u2019s agenda in Washington. Biden won Georgia narrowly but has seen his approval ratings in the state fall significantly since 2020. But Walker also has made abortion an issue. During the Republican Senate primary, he openly backed a national ban on abortions with no exceptions for cases involving rape, incest or a woman\u2019s health being at risk \u2014 particularly notable at a time when the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court precedent has been overturned and Democrats in Congress have been discussing codifying abortion rights into federal law. \u201cI\u2019m for life,\u201d Walker has said repeatedly as he campaigns. When asked about whether he\u2019d allow for any exceptions, he has said there are \u201cno excuses\u201d for the procedure. As the Republican nominee, Walker has sometimes sidestepped questions about his earlier support for a national abortion ban, a tacit nod to the fact that most voters, including many Republicans, want at least some legal access to abortion. Walker instead tries to turn the issue against Warnock, who supports abortion rights. Walker often says he doesn\u2019t understand how Warnock, a Baptist pastor, can support the procedure being legal. Campaigning in Dunwoody, an Atlanta suburb, on Monday night, Warnock stressed his support for abortion rights. \u201cI have a profound reverence for life. I have a deep and abiding respect for choice. I believe a patient\u2019s room is too small and cramped a space for a woman, her doctor and the United States government,\u201d he said, emphasizing Walker\u2019s support for a national ban. Warnock was dismissive when told of The Daily Beast story and when asked whether it might affect the outcome in Georgia. \u201cI\u2019ll let the pundits decide,\u201d he said. Walker\u2019s son, Christian Walker, criticized his father in aseries of tweetslate Monday, saying his family \u201casked him not to run for office.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care about someone who has a bad past and takes accountability,\u201d Christian Walker tweeted. \u201cBut how DARE YOU LIE and act as though you\u2019re some \u2018moral, Christian, upright man.\u2019 You\u2019ve lived a life of DESTROYING other peoples lives. How dare you.\u201d For now, Republicans in Washington are standing by Walker, with a spokesman for the Senate GOP\u2019s campaign arm dismissing The Daily Beast story as \u201cnonsense\u201d rooted in desperation by Democrats. \u201cThey and their media allies are doing what they always do \u2014 attack Republicans with innuendo and lies,\u201d said Chris Hartline, a top aide at the National Republican Senatorial Committee.",

        "By JONATHAN J. COOPEROctober 5, 2022 GMT",
        " PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 A spokesman for Kari Lake said Tuesday the Republican candidate for Arizona governor didn\u2019t mean to suggestabortionshould be legal, saying she\u2019s not calling for changes to abortion laws weeks after a judge ruled thatprosecutors can enforcea near-total ban on terminating pregnancies. In her most expansive comments on abortion since the ruling last month, Lake told a Phoenix talk radio host that it should be \u201crare and legal\u201d before saying twice that it should be \u201crare but safe.\u201d Ross Trumble, a spokesman for Lake, said she meant to say only \u201crare but safe.\u201d \u201cYou know, it would be really wonderful if abortion was rare and legal \u2014 the way they said it before, remember? Rare but safe, rare but safe, I think is what they said,\u201d Lake told conservative host Mike Broomhead on KTAR radio. \u201cIt\u2019d be really wonderful if that\u2019s how it turned out. But that\u2019s not what they want, Mike. They don\u2019t want rare but safe.\u201d Lake appeared to be referring to former President Bill Clinton\u2019s famous line that abortion should be \u201csafe, legal and rare.\u201d Arizona doctors stopped performing abortions late last month after a judge in Tucson ruled that prosecutors can enforce a law dating to 1864 that bans abortion unless it\u2019s necessary to save a woman\u2019s life. Arizona also has a law passed this year that bans abortion after 15 weeks, creating speculation about what\u2019s allowed. Trumble said either the total ban or the 15-week law would fit Lake\u2019s standard of abortion being \u201crare but safe.\u201d \u201c\u2018Rare but safe\u2019 would apply to whatever the current law is interpreted to mean,\u201d Trumble said. He said Lake has no plans to ask the Legislature to change abortion laws and declined to say whether she would sign legislation expanding access, saying he wouldn\u2019t address \u201chypotheticals.\u201d Asked in the radio interview whether she would support allowing abortion in cases of rape and incest \u2014 both are disallowed under the total abortion ban and the 15-week law \u2014 Lake demurred. \u201cThat\u2019s a very small percentage of abortions,\u201d she said. She said her Democratic opponent, Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, has the more extreme position, accusing her of supporting abortion without restrictions. Hobbs says decisions about abortions should be made by women and their doctors without government interference. Lake has spoken positively of Arizona\u2019s total ban on abortion, which she called \u201ca great law that\u2019s already on the books.\u201d She has called abortion \u201cthe ultimate sin,\u201d said abortion pills should be illegal and that she would sign a bill banning abortion as soon as fetal cardiac activity can be detected, usually around six weeks gestational age and before many women know they\u2019re pregnant. Democrats haveseized on the ruling, which revived the issue ahead of next month\u2019s midterm elections. Democratic lawmakers sent a letter on Tuesday asking Republican Gov. Doug Ducey to call a special session of the Legislature to repeal the 1864 abortion ban.",

    "Trump asks Supreme Court to intervene in Mar-a-Lago dispute": [
        "By ERIC TUCKEROctober 4, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Lawyers for former President Donald Trump asked the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday to step into the legal fight over the classified documents seized during anFBI search of his Florida estate, escalating a dispute over the powers of an independent arbiter appointed to inspect the records. The Trump team asked the justices to overturn a lower court ruling and allow the arbiter, called a special master, to review theroughly 100 documents with classification markingsthat were taken in the Aug. 8 search of Mar-a-Lago. A three-judge panel from the Atlanta-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuitlast month limited the special master\u2019s reviewto the much larger tranche of non-classified documents. The judges, including two Trump appointees, sided with the Justice Department, which had argued there was no legal basis for the special master to conduct his own review of the classified records. But Trump\u2019s lawyers said in their application to the Supreme Court that it was essential for the special master to have access to the classified records to \u201cdetermine whether documents bearing classification markings are in fact classified, and regardless of classification, whether those records are personal records or Presidential records.\u201d \u201cSince President Trump had absolute authority over classification decisions during his Presidency, the current status of any disputed document cannot possibly be determined solely by reference to the markings on that document,\u201d the application states. It says that without the special master review, \u201cthe unchallenged views of the current Justice Department would supersede the established authority of the Chief Executive.\u201d An independent review, the Trump team says, ensures a \u201ctransparent process that provides much-needed oversight.\u201d The FBI says it seized roughly 11,000 documents, including about 100 with classification markings, during its search. The Trump team asked a judge in Florida, Aileen Cannon, to appoint a special master to do an independent review of the records. Cannonsubsequently assigned a veteran Brooklyn judge, Raymond Dearie,to review the records and segregate those that may be protected by claims of attorney-client privilege and executive privilege. She also barred the FBI from being able to use the classified documents as part of its criminal investigation. The Justice Department appealed, prompting the 11th Circuit to lift Cannon\u2019s hold on investigators\u2019 ability to scrutinize the classified records. The appeals court also ruled that the department did not have to provide Dearie with access to the classified records. Trump\u2019s lawyers submitted the Supreme Court application to Justice Clarence Thomas, who oversees emergency matters from Florida and several other Southern states. Thomas can act on his own or, as is usually done, refer the emergency appeal to the rest of the court. Late Tuesday the court said the government was being asked to respond to the petition by Oct. 11. Thomas has previouslycome under scrutiny for his votein a different Trump documents case, in which he was the only member of the court to vote againstallowing the U.S. House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riotto obtain Trump records held by the National Archives and Records Administration. Thomas\u2019 wife,Virginia \u201cGinni\u201d Thomas, is a conservative activist and staunch Trump supporter who attended the Jan. 6 \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally on the Ellipse and wrote to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows in the weeks following the election encouraging him to work to overturn Biden\u2019s victory and keep Trump in office. She alsocontacted lawmakers in ArizonaandWisconsinin the weeks after the election. Thomas was recently interviewed by the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection and shestood by the false claim that the 2020 election was fraudulent. ____ Associated Press writers Mark Sherman and Jessica Gresko contributed to this report.

    "US starts fiscal year with record $31 trillion in debt": [
        "By FATIMA HUSSEINOctober 4, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The nation\u2019s gross national debt has surpassed $31 trillion, according to a U.S. Treasuryreportreleased Tuesday that logs America\u2019s daily finances. Edging closer to the statutory ceiling of roughly $31.4 trillion \u2014 an artificial cap Congress placed on the U.S. government\u2019s ability to borrow \u2014 the debt numbers hit an already tenuous economy facing high inflation, rising interest rates and a strong U.S. dollar. And while President Joe Biden hastouted his administration\u2019s deficit reductionefforts this year and recently signed the so-called Inflation Reduction Act, which attempts to tame 40-year high price increases caused by a variety of economic factors, economists say the latest debt numbers are a cause for concern. Owen Zidar, a Princeton economist, said rising interest rates will exacerbate the nation\u2019s growing debt issues and make the debt itself more costly. The Federal Reservehas raised ratesseveral times this year in an effort to combat inflation. Zidar said the debt \u201cshould encourage us to consider some tax policies that almost passed through the legislative process but didn\u2019t get enough support,\u201d like imposing higher taxes on the wealthy and closing the carried interest loophole, which allows money managers to treat their income as capital gains. \u201cI think the point here is if you weren\u2019t worried before about the debt before, you should be \u2014 and if you were worried before, you should be even more worried,\u201d Zidar said. The Congressional Budget Office earlier this yearreleased a report on America\u2019s debt load, warning in its 30-year outlook that, if unaddressed, the debt will soon spiral upward to new highs that could ultimately imperil the U.S. economy. In its August Mid-Session Review, the administration forecasted that this year\u2019s budget deficit will be nearly $400 billion lower than it estimated back in March, due in part to stronger than expected revenues, reduced spending, and an economy that has recovered all the jobs lost during the multi-year pandemic. In full, this year\u2019s deficit willdecline by $1.7 trillion, representing the single largest decline in the federal deficit in American history, the Office of Management and Budget said in August. Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said in an emailed statement Tuesday, \u201cThis is a new record no one should be proud of.\u201d \u201cIn the past 18 months, we\u2019ve witnessed inflation rise to a 40-year high, interest rates climbing in part to combat this inflation, and several budget-busting pieces of legislation and executive actions,\u201d MacGuineas said. \u201cWe are addicted to debt.\u201d A representative from the Treasury Department was not immediately available for comment. Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at Loyola Marymount University, said \u201cit took this nation 200 years to pile up its first trillion dollars in national debt, and since the pandemic we have been adding at the rate of 1 trillion nearly every quarter.\u201d Predicting high inflation for the \u201cforeseeable future,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen you increase government spending and money supply, you will pay the price later.\u201d",

    "White House keeps focus on abortion as midterms approach": [
        "By CHRIS MEGERIAN and COLLEEN LONGOctober 4, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 With few options for strengthening abortion access, President Joe Biden is trying to keep the issue front and center in the leadup to the midterm elections, when Democrats hope to harness anger over growing restrictions to keep control of Congress. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris gathered several Cabinet secretaries and other top administration officials on Tuesday in a bureaucratic show of force as they met with doctors from around the country. \u201cFolks, what century are we in?\u201d Biden asked, warning that conservatives could unravel the ability to obtain birth control next. \u201cBut this is what it looks like when you start to take away the right of privacy.\u201d The event marked 100 days since the U.S. Supreme Courtoverturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that legalized abortion nationwide. Most abortions are banned in at least 14 states now following a Republican-led effort, and others are weighing severe restrictions. Doctors say the laws, intended or not, have implications far beyond abortion, and have already seen problems with miscarriage care and pregnancy loss. The ripple effects have galvanized Democrats, raising hopes that they might be able todefy political gravitythat usually means the party in power loses seats during the midterms. With a conservative majority on the Supreme Court for the foreseeable future, there\u2019s no path to restoring abortion rights unless Democrats expand their slim majorities in Congress. Voting has already begunin a handful of states, and Harris said more Democrats need to be elected for their party to have the power to pass a nationwide law enshrining abortion access. \u201cIt is important for everyone to know what is at stake,\u201d Harris said. \u201cTo stop and reverse these attacks on women, we need to pass such a national law. And so we need the American people to make their voices heard, and take a stand on the rights of all women to exercise their choice to have access to reproductive healthcare.\u201d Georgia lawprevents abortion after roughly six weeks of pregnancy. Dr. Nisha Verma, who attended the meeting on Tuesday, said she is \u201cbeing forced to grapple with impossible situations where the laws of my state directly violate the medical expertise I gained through years of training, and the oath I took to provide the best care to my patients.\u201d Wisconsin implemented a ban on abortionthat was adopted in 1849, preventing the procedure except to save a mother\u2019s life. The law was written before women were even allowed to vote on it. Dr. Kristin Lyerly said she fears a prosecutor would question a decision to provide an abortion for health reasons. \u201cCan I count on him to trust my clinical judgement? Looking back, would we agree that I met the criteria, that my patient was sick enough?\u201d she said. \u201cThe effects are chilling.\u201d Although the White House has been under pressure to take more aggressive steps to safeguard abortion, there are also concerns about provoking lawsuits that could lead to further restrictions on abortion when the cases reach the Supreme Court. The two steps announced Tuesday are reminders of the administration\u2019s limited toolbox. TheEducation Department is sending guidanceto universities reminding them that federal law requires that they \u201cprotect their students from discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, including pregnancy termination.\u201d The Department of Health and Human Services will also release $6 million in new funding to promote family planning services. In conjunction with the meeting, Jennifer Klein, the director of the White House\u2019s Gender Policy Council and the leader of the White House task force, issued a new memo outlining the impact of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on abortion in the case ofDobbs v. Jackson decision. \u201cClose to 30 million women of reproductive age now live in a state with a ban \u2014 including nearly 22 million women who cannot access abortion care after six weeks, before most women know they are pregnant,\u201d she wrote. \u201cExtreme abortion bans are having consequences that extend beyond abortion, including reports of women being denied access to necessary prescriptions and contraception at pharmacies and on college campuses.\u201d Chris Wilson, a Republican strategist, said he believes the intense reaction to the court decision is fading, undermining Democratic chances in the midterms. \u201cWhat\u2019s sad is the party of \u2018safe, legal and rare\u2019 has become a single-issue party where the new rallying cry is \u2018anytime, any age and paid for by taxpayers\u2019 because they know they\u2019re way behind on the economy, on crime, and don\u2019t even have the advantage on education that they had in years past,\u201d he said. Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, disagreed. She said voter registration has surged among young women, and they\u2019re poised for higher turnout this year. Abortion, she said, is \u201cone of the clearest distinctions between the candidates. So that makes it an issue that\u2019s still very salient.\u201d \u201cRepublicans are battling to make it a referendum,\u201d Lake said. \u201cWe\u2019re battling to make it a choice.\u201d",

    "Both candidates courting veterans in big Nevada Senate race": [
        "By SCOTT SONNEROctober 4, 2022 GMT",
        " RENO, Nev. (AP) \u2014 Common sense more than any campaign strategy dictated that Adam Laxalt not trumpet his own military service in Nevada\u2019s sometimes-heated Republican Senate primary. After all, the ex-attorney general, who served as a Navy judge advocate general in Iraq, was running against retired Army Capt. Sam Brown, a war hero who was nearly killed by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan and whose badly scarred face serves as a more powerful reminder of his sacrifice than his Purple Heart. But with his former foe now turned patriotic ally, Laxalt, the son of a U.S. senator and grandson of another, is trying to make the most of his own military career. He is relying on familiar GOP buzzwords in appealing to veterans to help save the country from \u201cthe left\u201d and calling Democrats the party of the \u201cmegarich\u201d as he tries to unseat Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto. In some cases he is also capitalizing further on his military experience \u2014 and Cortez Masto\u2019s lack of it \u2014 with links to conservative issues from U.S. border safety to government overreach on things like COVID-19. He warns about the dangers of Afghan terrorists, prematurely released from captivity, sneaking into the U.S. and pledges to reinstate military members who were discharged for refusing to get coronavirus vaccinations. They\u2019re the kind of campaign issues that strike a chord with many rallying around candidates like Laxalt, backed by former President Trump in a Western battleground that Republicans view as one of their best chances to turn a blue Senate seat red. \u201cFirst and foremost, there is no substitute for service. And we all know that,\u201d Laxalt said recently at the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Reno, where he and Brown served up free hot dogs. \u201cObviously, Sen. Masto hasn\u2019t served.\u201d It\u2019s a line he couldn\u2019t use in debates with Brown, who denounced Laxalt during the primary as part of the \u201celite\u201d Washington establishment. Laxalt \u2014 the grandson of former U.S. Sen. and Nevada Gov. Paul Laxalt, and son of former Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M. \u2014 spent much of his early life in the D.C. area. He graduated from Georgetown law school, was an assistant law professor at the U.S. Naval Academy and served with the JAG Corps in Iraq but didn\u2019t engage in the sort of field combat Brown saw with the 1st Infantry in 2008. At the VFW, Laxalt was introduced by an ex-commander of a B-2 test squad who created a potentially awkward moment when referencing Laxalt\u2019s role in the military before the room eventually erupted into laughter. \u201cI\u2019ll forgive him for being a JAG,\u201d Air Force Col. Tony Grady said. \u201cBut then, not really, because when I was a commander, the JAG was in my hip pocket, to keep me out of trouble.\u201d Brown never claimed his military record outranked Laxalt\u2019s, but he did make veiled references during the primary to the way each got where they are. \u201cI wasn\u2019t born into power,\u201d Brown said in his first ad, describing the Taliban bomb that \u201cnearly killed me,\u201d the soldiers who dragged his burning body to safety under mortar fire and his subsequent 30 surgeries. Each pitch ended with the same tag line: \u201cCareer politicians can\u2019t fix Washington; they broke it.\u201d Initially, the quote was juxtaposed with images of Cortez Masto and President Joe Biden but later was accompanied by photos of Cortez Masto and Laxalt. Now, Brown is singing Laxalt\u2019s praises and pleading with vets of all political stripes to rally behind him. \u201cWhat we do in primaries as Republicans is identify who can lay down the most effective fire, and they become the main effort,\u201d Brown said. \u201cOur duty is to go out there and be those foot soldiers for Adam Laxalt.\u201d At the VFW, Laxalt linked Cortez Masto to Democratic policies he says have weakened the U.S. military, disrespected its soldiers and made young Americans less likely to enlist. His biggest applause came when he ridiculed those who \u201cwonder why\u201d military recruiting is down. \u201cWell, how about because they kicked out service members for refusing to take the COVID shots?\u201d Laxalt said. \u201cWe have Navy SEALS after 12-year investments and 15 tours of duty to terrible places. I\u2019m a guaranteed vote to reinstate those people.\u201d Laxalt said he\u2019d heard Cortez Masto hadn\u2019t held a town hall meeting with veterans for at least a year. Not true, her campaign said. Cortez Masto, whose father and grandfather served in the U.S. Army, hosted at least a dozen events with Nevada veterans in the past year \u201cto make sure she\u2019s hearing their concerns and is able to deliver the federal support they need,\u201d her campaign said in an email. Her accomplishments include approval of the construction of a national veterans cemetery in Elko that locals had sought for nearly a decade. She helped pass a bill guaranteeing health and compensation benefits for veterans exposed to Agent Orange. Her legislation to protect VA benefits for student veterans was signed into law, as was a measure she backed to improve veterans\u2019 access to mental health services. As he did during the primary, Laxalt reminds vets he founded the nation\u2019s first state office of military legal services as Nevada\u2019s attorney general \u2014 a creation the Pentagon eventually embraced and several states later adopted. He touts his JAG work in Iraq \u2014 where his legal team oversaw more than 20,000 detainees \u2014 when blasting the Biden administration\u2019s withdrawal from Afghanistan, \u201cleaving billions of dollars of weapons behind\u201d for potential terrorists. He said the \u201cAfghan debacle\u201d marked the first time Americans \u201ctook the measure of this commander in chief and knew he was not up to the job.\u201d \u201cSen. Masto is not holding him accountable,\u201d Laxalt said. \u201cA terrorist that was released in Afghanistan could actually be in this country today. This is a huge issue, and it\u2019s an absolute shame that Sen. Masto is dead silent on this.\u201d Cortez Masto insists she has pushed back on Biden\u2019s method of withdrawal from Afghanistan after criticizing Trump\u2019s proposal to withdraw without a plan in place. She gets high marks from Ross Bryant, a retired Army veteran who is the executive director of UNLV\u2019s Military & Veteran Services Center in Las Vegas. Bryant describes himself as a moderate Republican who has voted for candidates in both parties. He\u2019s glad when veterans are elected to Congress and acknowledges the veteran community \u201cis sometimes very harsh: \u2018If you are not a vet, you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like.\u2019\u201d He said that Laxalt \u201cdid great for us\u201d as attorney general, and that Brown\u2019s backing should carry weight with some: \u201cHe\u2019s been wounded, he\u2019s one of us.\u2019\u201d But, he said, it\u2019s wrong to portray Cortez Masto as anything but a staunch, effective advocate for veterans. He ticks off a list that includes expanding Agent Orange coverage to toxic burn-pit exposures, pressuring federal agencies to set up booths at UNLV\u2019s veteran job fairs, and reversing benefit formulas during the COVID pandemic that would have drastically reduced $9 million worth of vet benefits for remote-students at UNLV alone. \u201cAt the end of the day, she has delivered. She\u2019s been a rock star for us,\u201d Bryant said.",

    "Lawyers: Arizona GOP chair pleaded Fifth to Jan. 6 panel": [
        "By BOB CHRISTIEOctober 4, 2022 GMT",
        " PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward refused to answer questions during a deposition of the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol, an attorney for the panel revealed Tuesday during a court hearing in Phoenix. Attorney Eric Columbus told a federal judge that Ward asserted her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when she complied with a subpoena from the House committee. The detail about Ward\u2019s deposition came at a hearing where lawyers urged a federal judge to block the committee from getting her phone records while she appeals.U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa ruled on Sept. 23that Ward\u2019s arguments that her phone call records should be secret did not pass legal muster. Ward attorney Laurin Mills cast the phone records fight as one with major implications for democracy, on par if not bigger than the violent insurrection that unfolded at the Capitol. \u201cThis is the first time in American history that a select committee of the United State Congress controlled by one party has subpoenaed the records of the state chair of the rival party,\u201d Mills said. He said the outcome will set important precedent, not just for the current case but for others that will come when Republicans ultimately control Congress. The House Committee investigating the attack on the Capitol is seeking phone records from just before the November 2020 election to Jan. 31, 2021. That would include a period where Ward was pushing for former President Donald Trump\u2019s election defeat to be overturned and while Congress was set to certify the results. Kelli Ward and her husband Michael Ward were presidential electors who would have voted for Trump in the Electoral College had he won Arizona. Both signed a document falsely claiming they were Arizona\u2019s true electors, despite Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the state. Columbus said that investigators get telephone records all the time, and noted that congressional investigators can\u2019t arrest or charge anyone with a crime. And he noted Congress does not know all that is involved with Ward\u2019s action to overturn President Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 win. \u201cDr. Ward was deposed by the select committee and she declined to answer on every substantive question under her rights under the Fifth Amendment,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are other aspects of her involvement that are not at this point fully understood.\u201d Ward is hardly the first witness to refuse the committee\u2019s questions. Others who have asserted their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination include Trump allies Michael Flynn, Roger Stone and lawyer John Eastman. Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones also asserted his Fifth Amendment rights. The committee has talked to more than 1,000 other witnesses, including many White House aides and several of Trump\u2019s lawyers and confidants. But Mills noted during the hearing that there is a parallel criminal investigation underway, and in the appeal her lawyers noted that she and the other 10 fake Arizona electors received grand jury subpoenas from the Department of Justice. \u201cAll I can say is if we do this wrong, we will set a precedent that is worse than the Capitol riot,\u201d Mills said. Mills told the judge that the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has set a briefing schedule and could decide the case as early as January. Columbus noted that will likely be too late, since the committee dissolves on Jan. 3, when the current congressional session ends. The Wards say the subpoena should be quashed because it violates their First Amendment rights, violates House rules and exceeds the authority of the Jan. 6 committee. Humetewa rejected each argument in turn in her earlier ruling and is considering their request to block access during appeal. Kelli Ward is a staunch Trump ally who has aggressively promoted the false claim that the election was stolen from him. In the days after the election, she pressured Republicans on the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors to investigate unsupported claims of fraud before election results were certified, according to text messages released by the county. A spokesperson for the. 6 committee did not immediately respond Tuesday to a request for comment. ___ Associated Press writers Farnoush Amiri and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed from Washington.",

    "Rival calls incendiary ad by Kentucky Sen. Paul \u2018dangerous\u2019": [
        "By BRUCE SCHREINEROctober 4, 2022 GMT",
        " LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) \u2014 Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul was the victim of a violent attack in 2017 when his neighbor slammed into him from behind outside his Kentucky home. Earlier that year, Paul took cover when a gunman opened fire while GOP members of Congress practiced for a charity baseball game. Paul revived those traumatic events in his bid for reelection this year, with an incendiary social media video attacking his Democratic challenger, Charles Booker. The video, released Monday shortly before a Senate campaign forum he declined to take part in, says outright that Booker \u201cdoesn\u2019t believe in civil discourse, only violence.\u201d It accuses the Black former state lawmaker of associating with members of the \u201cradical left\u201d who condone and perpetrate violence. Booker denounced the ad, saying it includes \u201cdangerous and dishonest rhetoric.\u201d \u201cHis ad grossly lies about me and, in a very sinister way, attacks several Kentucky citizens by name,\u201d Booker said Tuesday. \u201cNeither I, nor my campaign, have ever endorsed violence against any political candidate. It is despicable for Rand Paul to even insinuate that. As an elected official and candidate, my family and I have received death threats \u2014 this is not something I take lightly because I understand the issue intimately.\u201d The video was the latest eyebrow-raising tactic in a campaign featuring unconventional politicians. Booker appeared with anoose around his neckin an online ad soon after the spring primary to draw attention to Paul\u2019s stance on anti-lynching legislation. Paul\u2019s video doesn\u2019t mention unrest from the far right or the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. In the wake of the FBI\u2019s search of former President Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago home,law enforcement officialsacross the country warned about an increase in threats and the potential for violent attacks on federal agents or buildings. The video was released as a preemptive attack against Booker shortly before the Democratic challenger appeared at a campaign forum aired on statewide television. Paul, who is seeking a third term in November, was invited but did not participate in the program. Paul\u2019s campaign scoured through social media to make its video claims that Booker\u2019s campaign has \u201cembraced people who celebrate and glorify\u201d violence against Paul. It says a Booker volunteer tweeted a \u201cgraphic doctored image\u201d of Paul with a broken neck. And it claims a woman featured supporting Booker in a social media video has referred to Paul\u2019s attacker as her hero. The senator suffered broken ribs and laterunderwent lung surgeryfor injuries he says he sustained in the attack. The assailant was given a prison sentence and Paul was awarded more than $580,000 indamages and medical expensesin his lawsuit against the man. Booker said Tuesday that to associate him with Paul\u2019s \u201cviolent altercation with his neighbor from five years ago is desperate, ridiculous, wholly offensive and unacceptable.\u201d \u201cRand Paul has used racially charged dog whistles throughout this campaign to paint a violent picture of me, instead of having the backbone to face me and the people of Kentucky on the merits of our vision for this commonwealth,\u201d Booker said. The video also references 2019 remarks by a Black Lives Matter leader in Louisville that appeared to condone violence against Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. \u201cCivil debate is an admired quality in a Republic but justifying, mocking, or celebrating violence, as documented in this video of Booker and his allies, should be rejected,\u201d Paul said Monday. During his Monday night appearance on Kentucky Educational Television, Booker accused Paul of \u201cblowing the dog whistle\u201d on public safety and policing issues. Paul\u2019s campaign and his allies have tried to connect Booker with the \u201cdefund the police\u201d movement. \u201cRand Paul wants people to look at the color of my skin instead of my record,\u201d Booker said. Paul has frequently visited mostly Black neighborhoods during his Senate tenure, touting criminal justice reforms, anti-violence efforts and education initiatives. When pressed during the KET program on whether he supports eliminating law enforcement budgets, Booker replied: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to get rid of budgets for law enforcement or any government agency.\u201d Supporting \u201cstructural change,\u201d he said, doesn\u2019t equate to backing \u201cany sort of abolishment.\u201d \u201cWhen there\u2019s a crisis, when someone\u2019s in an emergency, we all want to call 911 and have someone in law enforcement come to our aid,\u201d Booker said. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t need is that same agency we call to protect and serve us, kick in our door and shoot us in the dead of night.\u201d In 2020, Booker marched in protests sparked in part by the death of Breonna Taylor, a Black womanshotwhen police officers burst into her Louisville apartment during a narcotics investigation. They found no drugs. Booker ran for the Senate that year but narrowly lost in the Democratic primary.",

    "Another shift for NH GOP Senate candidate on 2020 election": [
        "By HOLLY RAMEROctober 4, 2022 GMT",
        " HUDSON, N.H. (AP) \u2014 Don Bolduc isn\u2019t making a full about-face, but the Republican nominee for Senate in New Hampshire can\u2019t seem to stop shifting his position about whetherthe 2020 presidential election was legitimate. The retired Army general claimed during hisprimary campaignthat the White House race was stolen from former President Donald Trump. Then, after Bolduc won the Sept. 13 vote, he said it wasn\u2019t. By Monday, at a town hall in Hudson, he said he doesn\u2019t know what happened. \u201cI can\u2019t say that it was stolen or not. I don\u2019t have enough information,\u201d Bolduc said in response to a voter\u2019s question. \u201cBut what I can say is that we have irregularity.\u201d Bolduc, running against Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan in November, told a second voter who pressed him on the issue that he believes the election was marred by fraud. Then Bolduc suggested that the only way to hold Democrat Joe Biden responsible for what Bolduc considers impeachable offenses as president is to acknowledgehis win. \u201cWe have to be able to say, whether we agree with it or not, a constitutional process was followed to put him in the White House so we can then hold him accountable,\u201d he said. Trump has called Bolduc a \u201cstrong guy, tough guy,\u201d but did not formally endorse the candidate in the primary. Like many others who relied on Trump\u2019s backing or encouragement to help secure a nomination, Bolduc now must try to appeal to a broader swath of the electorate in the general election. Nearly two years after Trump\u2019s defeat, there has been no evidence of widespread fraud. Numerous reviews in the battleground states where Trump disputed his loss have affirmed the results, courts have rejected dozens of lawsuits filed by Trump and his allies, and even Trump\u2019s ownDepartment of Justiceconcluded the results were accurate. Through it all, Bolduc\u2019s position has wavered. During a debate in August, Bolduc was clear: \u201cI signed a letter with 120 other generals and admirals, saying that Trump won the election, and damn it, I stand by my oath,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not switching horses, baby.\u201d But two days after the GOP primary, he toldFox Newsthat had since done \u201ca lot of research\u201d on the topic. \u201cI have come to the conclusion, and I want to be definitive about this, that the election was not stolen,\u201d Bolduc said. One voter who questioned Bolduc on the topic Monday said he was unsatisfied with the candidate\u2019s response, but the other said he has her vote. \u201cI\u2019m done with these treasonous people in the White House, in our government,\u201d said Mary Margaret Burke of Hampstead. \u201cThey need to go, and we need to make that happen.\u201d ___ Follow AP for full coverage of the midterms at https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections and on Twitter, https://twitter.com/ap_politics",

    "US announces new $625M security package for Ukraine": [
        "By AAMER MADHANIOctober 4, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The U.S. announced plans on Tuesday to provide an additional $625 million in military aid to Ukraine, a package that includes additional advanced rocket systems credited with helping the country\u2019s military gain momentum in its war with Russia. President Joe Biden provided details on the latest package\u2014which includes four High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, known as HIMARS, 200 mine resistant vehicles, hundreds of thousands of rounds of artillery and mortar ammunition\u2014in a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Vice President Kamala Harris joined the leaders on Tuesday\u2019s call. The U.S. and Ukraine leaders spoke asRussia\u2019s upper house of parliamenton Tuesday formally approved the annexation of swaths of Ukrainian territory following referendums that Ukraine and its Western allies dismissed as fraudulent. \u201cPresident Biden also affirmed the continued readiness of the United States to impose severe costs on any individual, entity, or country that provides support to Russia\u2019s purported annexation,\u201d the White House said in a statement. This round of military aid marks the first time the U.S. has sent additional HIMARS to Ukraine since late July. The systems\u2014which will bring the total number of HIMARS sent to Ukraine to 20\u2014 have become a key tool in Ukraine\u2019s ability to strike bridges that Russia has used to supply its troops, enabling Ukrainian forces to make inroads in Russia-controlled regions. The U.S. in recent weeks also provided funding through a separate program \u2014 the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative \u2014 so another 18 HIMARS can be purchased through longer-term contracts. USAI funds are being used as part of the effort by the U.S. and Western allies to ensure Ukraine\u2019s forces are trained and equipped to defend their country in the years to come. But those contracts will take several years to fulfill. This is the first tranche of U.S. aid delivered in the new fiscal year, which began Oct. 1. Ukraine has pressed its counteroffensive in the Kherson region since the summer, relentlessly pummeling Russian supply lines and making inroads into Russian-held areas west of the Dnieper River. Ukrainian troops have been using the HIMARS to repeatedly hit the main bridge across the Dnieper and a dam that served as a second crossing. It also has struck pontoon bridges that Russia has used to supply its troops. Ukraine\u2019s battlefield successes in Kherson are notable since that is one of the four areas that Russia is in the process of annexing. \u2014 Associated Press writer Lolita C. Baldor contributed reporting.",

    "Kids with disabilities face off-the-books school suspensions": [
        "By MEREDITH KOLODNER and ANNIE MAOctober 4, 2022 GMT",
        " The phone call from her son\u2019s school was alarming. The assistant principal told her to come to the school immediately. But when Lisa Manwell arrived at Pioneer Middle School in Plymouth, Michigan, her son wasn\u2019t sick or injured. He was sitting calmly in the principal\u2019s office. John, who has ADHD and finds it soothing to fidget during class, had been removed from the classroom after he refused to stop using a pair of safety scissors to cut his cuticles. When she asked why he couldn\u2019t stay for the rest of the day, Manwell said the school told her they would call child protective services if she didn\u2019t take him home. The call was just one of a dozen that Manwell received last fall telling her John couldn\u2019t stay in school because of behaviors she says stemmed from his disability, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Many schools have promised to cut down on suspensions, since kids can\u2019t learn as well when they aren\u2019t in class. But none of these pickups was ever recorded as suspensions, despite the missed class time. The practice is known as informal removal, defined by the U.S. Education Department as an action taken by school staff in response to a child\u2019s behavior that excludes the child for part or all of the school day \u2014 or even indefinitely. Excessive use of informal removals amounts to a form of off-the-books discipline \u2014 a de facto denial of education that evades accountability, advocates and legal experts say. It has special implications for kids with disabilities: Informally removing these students circumvents federal law that protects them from being disciplined or barred from class for behaviors related to their disability. Since the pandemic began, parents of disabled kids say the practice is on the rise, denying their kids their legal right to an education. \u201cThis is a repeat issue that we see in enforcement across the country, over years,\u201d said Catherine E. Lhamon, assistant secretary for the department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights. \u201cAnd that means that the practice has taken hold in a way that is dangerous for students and needs to be addressed.\u201d In July, the department issued guidance on discriminatory practices in discipline for students with disabilities. Lhamon said the guidance included informal removals because of how frequently they appeared in the office\u2019s investigations of complaints against school districts. Informal removals can happen through frequent parent pickups, shortened school days or hours spent in \u201ctime-out\u201d rooms. The Associated Press and The Hechinger Report interviewed 20 families in 10 states who described being called repeatedly and at all hours of the school day to pick up their children. In some cases, parents were called less than an hour into the school day. Others said they had to leave work to get their child so frequently they lost their jobs. Many felt they had no choice but to change schools, or even districts. Because the removals aren\u2019t recorded, there\u2019s no way to quantify how often they happen. But the National Disability Rights Network says it has seen an increase during the pandemic. Teacher shortagesmean there are fewer staffers available to do evaluations and provide services for disabled students, creating \u201cmore of an incentive or more of a push for getting kids with behavioral needs out,\u201d said Dan Stewart, the organization\u2019s managing attorney for education and employment. Students of color with a disability appear to be disproportionately affected based on anecdotal reports to the network from disability rights advocates around the country. \u201cIt\u2019s pervasive,\u201d said Ginny Fogg, an attorney at Disability Rights North Carolina, \u201cand the reason for that is that most parents don\u2019t know their rights and the consequence for the school system is not enough to make them not do it.\u201d \u201cThe remedy isn\u2019t, \u2018You just can\u2019t go to school,\u2019\u201d she added. \u201cThe law was enacted 50 years ago to prevent this very outcome \u2014 that students with disabilities aren\u2019t allowed to go to school and participate in an education.\u201d Manwell said the calls from her son\u2019s school felt relentless. \u201cThey would be calling my personal phone, my work phone. They were calling my husband, who works nights,\u201d said Manwell, a resource planner at Ford Motor Co. \u201cIt was impossible. I couldn\u2019t function. I never knew when they were going to call or what was going to happen.\u201d An official from the Plymouth-Canton Community Schools district in Michigan where John goes to school said he couldn\u2019t comment on specific student issues, citing federal student privacy law. Federal law protects disabled students from being repeatedly disciplined or removed from school for behaviors related to their disability. If they are suspended for more than 10 days, families are entitled to a meeting with the school to determine whether the behaviors are a result of the child\u2019s disability. If they are, then the school must offer adjustments instead of suspension. For example, if a child\u2019s disability makes it difficult for them to focus in a loud classroom with dozens of other children, the parent has the right to request a quieter classroom or one with fewer children. The Education Department\u2019s July guidance made clear that children who are informally removed have the same rights, such as reviews of whether the student\u2019s behavior was a result of their disability, as those who had been officially suspended. Tricia Ellinger says she would have requested a hearing to make sure her 10-year-old daughter was getting appropriate services and support, had she known that her frequent removals from the classroom amounted to suspensions. One day last spring, she received three phone calls in rapid succession, telling her to immediately pick up Cassie from Kenneth J. Carberry Elementary School in Emmett, Idaho. When she arrived, her daughter was sitting quietly in the school\u2019s resource room eating a snack. She says a school staff member told her that Cassie was refusing to do her work and needed to go home. \u201cWhen I got her in the car, I asked her, \u2018Cass, what happened? Did you tear up your notebook? Did you throw your pencil?\u2019\u201d Ellinger recalled. \u201cShe said, \u2018No, it was just hard. Math is hard.\u2019\u201d The call was one of about 20 Ellinger says she got last year from the school, which is designed specifically to educate students with disabilities. She says her daughter was also taken out of class repeatedly and kept in a room by herself. None of the removals was recorded as suspensions. Emmett School District Superintendent Craig Woods said he couldn\u2019t comment, citing federal student privacy law. Families often do not know what grounds they have to lodge a complaint, Lhamon said. Sometimes they aren\u2019t aware their child should not have been suspended in the first place. \u201cThat is so concerning when schools are excluding students for reasons that are unlawful,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want our kids to be in class, learning with other students, fully participant and respected as learners. We do not want our school communities to be sending a message that there\u2019s some category of kids who can\u2019t be there.\u201d Manwell said most of the calls she got last year from her son\u2019s school were a result of bullying. On the fourth day of school, John got shoved in the locker room, and she got a call to pick him up. Another time, he went to the bathroom and another student threatened to beat him up. Because of his disability, John was supposed to be granted access to a quiet room so he could recover from difficult incidents. But often, she said, either there wasn\u2019t a room or when he didn\u2019t want to return to class, she\u2019d get a call to come pick him up. \u201cIt was just the stress of never knowing what I was sending my kid into each day. I was worrying the whole time he was gone,\u201d said Manwell. \u201cI could see the damage.\u201d \u201cHe was withdrawing. He started talking about hurting himself,\u201d she said, her voice breaking. In January, she made the difficult decision to switch John to homebound instruction, sending him to a tutoring center every day for a couple of hours and rearranging her work schedule. It made her life more predictable, she said, and John began to act like his old self. She said she\u2019d like to send him back to school but doesn\u2019t trust what will happen. \u201cYou want to protect your kids, right?\u201d she said. \u201cI just can\u2019t send him to a school where he won\u2019t be safe.\u201d ___ Parents, has your child been removed from class, especially because of a disability?

    "The Onion and the Supreme Court. Not a parody": [
        "By MARK SHERMANOctober 4, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Onion has some serious things to say in defense of parody. The satirical site that manages to persuade people to believe the absurd has filed a Supreme Court brief in support of a man who was arrested and prosecuted for making fun of police on social media. \u201cAs the globe\u2019s premier parodists, The Onion\u2019s writers also have a self-serving interest in preventing political authorities from imprisoning humorists,\u201d lawyers for the Onion wrote in a brief filed Monday. \u201cThis brief is submitted in the interest of at least mitigating their future punishment.\u201d The court filingdoesn\u2019t entirely keep a straight face, calling the federal judiciary \u201ctotal Latin dorks.\u201d The Onion said it employs 350,000 people, is read by 4.3 trillion people and \u201chas grown into the single most powerful and influential organization in human history.\u201d The Supreme Court case involves Anthony Novak, who was arrested after he spoofed the Parma, Ohio, police force in Facebook posts. The posts were published over 12 hours and included an announcement of new police hiring \u201cstrongly encouraging minorities to not apply.\u201d Another post promoted a fake event in which child sex offenders could be \u201cremoved from the sex offender registry and accepted as an honorary police officer.\u201d After being acquitted of criminal charges, the man sued the police for violating his constitutional rights. But a federal appeals court ruled the officers have \u201cqualified immunity\u201d and threw out the lawsuit. One issue is whether people might reasonably have believed that what they saw on Novak\u2019s site was real. But The Onion said Novak had no obligation to post a disclaimer. \u201cPut simply, for parody to work, it has to plausibly mimic the original,\u201d the Onion said, noting its own tendency to mimic \u201cthe dry tone of an Associated Press news story.\u201d More than once, people have republished the Onion\u2019s claims as true, including when it reported in2012 that North Korean leader Kim Jong-unwas the sexiest man alive. The brief concludes with a familiar call for the court to hear the case and a twist. \u201cThe petition for certiorari should be granted, the rights of the people vindicated, and various historical wrongs remedied. The Onion would welcome any one of the three, particularly the first,\u201d lawyers for the Onion wrote.",

    "Solomon Islands agreed to accord after China references axed": [
        "By NICK PERRYOctober 4, 2022 GMT",
        " WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) \u2014 Solomon Islands agreed to sign an accord between the United States and more than a dozen Pacific nations only after indirect references to China were removed, the Solomon Islands foreign minister said Tuesday. \u201cThere were some references that put us in a position where we\u2019ll have to choose sides, and we did not want to be placed in a position where we have to choose sides,\u201d Jeremiah Manele told reporters in Wellington. His remarks represented the first time Solomon Islands has publicly acknowledged it had initial concerns about the agreement and expressed why it had a change of heart. The accord wassigned in Washingtonlast week, with President Joe Biden telling visiting Pacific leaders that the U.S. was committed to bolstering its presence in the region and becoming a more collaborative partner. The administration pledged the U.S. would add $810 million in new aid for Pacific Island nations over the next decade. The summit came amid growing U.S. concern about China\u2019s military and economic influence in the Pacific. But thefinal agreementfocused mainly on issues like climate change, economic growth and natural disasters. A small section on security contained mostly broad language, and while it specifically condemned Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, it made no mention of China. Ahead of the summit, diplomats had said Solomon Islands was signaling it was unlikely to sign the joint declaration, which would have represented a diplomatic blow for both the U.S. and the Pacific nations. Many in the U.S. and the Pacific had been eager to get Solomon Islands on board afterbecoming alarmedabout the increasing ties between Solomon Islands and China, especially after the two nations signed a security agreement earlier this year. \u201cIn the initial draft, there were some references that we were not comfortable with, but then with the officials, after discussions and negotiations, we were able to find common ground,\u201d Manele said. Pressed further by reporters on those concerns, Manele acknowledged the draft had contained indirect references to China. He said the Solomon Islands security agreement with China was part of a national security strategy and there was no provision in it for China to build a military base, as some had feared. Meanwhile, in a report released Wednesday, researchers at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute think tank said the Chinese Communist Party has attempted to undermine the Solomon Islands\u2019 relationship with Australia and the U.S. by spreading false narratives through local and social media networks in Solomon Islands. The authors said they collected data from after riots that occurred in the capital last November and again after details of the security agreement with China were leaked in March and found the Communist Party used Facebook groups along with certain journalists and decision-makers to push its message. The authors said one false narrative pushed by the party was that Australia, the U.S. and Taiwan had instigated the riots and fomented unrest in the nation. Manele met with his New Zealand counterpart, Nanaia Mahuta, in Wellington at a potentially awkward venue \u2014 Parliament\u2019sRainbow Room, which is dedicated to the nation\u2019s gay, lesbian and transgender communities. The room features photographs of LGBTQ lawmakers and framed copies of bills relevant to those communities. In Solomon Islands, gay and lesbian sex remain illegal. Manele said Solomon Islands was a young democracy. \u201cThese are emerging issues. These are challenges that as a young country we will find ways to discuss,\u201d he said. Mahuta said there was no undertone or message intended in the choice of location. \u201cIt was the only available room for us to use,\u201d she said.",

    "Kelly, Hobbs face different prospects in crucial Ariz. races": [
        "By JONATHAN J. COOPEROctober 4, 2022 GMT",
        " PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 A year ago, Arizona\u2019s Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs was all over cable news, building a national profile as a defender of democracy and raking in cash for her campaign for governor. Democratic Sen.Mark Kelly, newly elected to finish the late John McCain\u2019s last term and running for reelection, looked to be among the most vulnerable members of the Senate. Fortunes appear to have flipped for the two Democrats as the midterm campaign enters the home stretch in a fast-growing, diverse state that is increasingly central to how the Democratic Party sees its future. Kelly maintains a position of strength in polling and fundraising while Hobbs is in a tighter spot. The dynamics reflect how the campaigns have sometimes pursued different strategies and face different types of rivals.Kari Lake, Hobbs\u2019 opponent as the Republican nominee for governor, has gained a significant following as a savvy ally of former President Donald Trump. Blake Masters, Kelly\u2019s rival in the Senate race, has struggled to gain the same type of traction. \u201cPeople like shiny objects, and Kari Lake is that shiny object that\u2019s putting herself out there,\u201d said Bridget Bellavigna, a Democrat who was inspired by Trump\u2019s election to get involved in local politics. She\u2019s running for constable in the Phoenix suburbs. A Fox News poll released Thursday found Kelly leading Republican Blake Masters 46% to 40%, while the race for governor was roughly tied. The survey of 1,008 Arizona voters was conducted Sept. 22-26. The margin of error was 3 percentage points. Hobbs and Kelly are working largely independently of one another and have not campaigned together. Both portray their Republican opponents as extremists but otherwise are taking different approaches to their public persona. Kelly, a former Navy pilot and astronaut, flies around the state in a rented four-seat plane, courting media attention along the way. Hobbs, by contrast, had a sparse presence on the campaign trail through the Democratic primary in August and much of the period since. She\u2019s focused her attention on rural areas far from the voter-rich areas of Phoenix and Tucson, where Democrats have to drive up turnout if they\u2019re to be competitive here. She\u2019s been more visible over the past two weeks, though she prefers choreographed events in which she largely sticks to a script and limits her interactions with journalists. In a brief interaction after an event last month, Hobbs said she\u2019s not running from tough questions. \u201cI\u2019m doing what my team is having me do,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to dodge anything.\u201d Hobbs is playing \u201cprevent defense,\u201d a cautious football strategy that concedes short gains to the opponent in an attempt to run out the clock, said Wes Gullett, a Republican consultant and former adviser to McCain. Gullett attached his name to a public list of Republicans supporting Democrat Adrian Fontes for secretary of state, but he\u2019s declined to do the same for Hobbs, though he says he\u2019d prefer that she beats Lake. \u201cWhat I want to see from Katie Hobbs is a more aggressive candidate,\u201d Gullett said. \u201cTalking about the issues that she cares about, talking about what\u2019s important.\u201d Late last month, Hobbs jumped on a chance to sharpen her message when a judge in Tucson ruled thatprosecutors can enforcea near-total ban on abortion that was first enacted during the Civil War. She pledged to use the full power of the governor\u2019s office toprotect women\u2019s rights, though she acknowledged there was little she could do without cooperation from the Legislature, which is likely to be controlled at least in part byRepublicans who oppose abortion. Hobbs announced over the weekend that she raised $1.2 million in the week following the abortion ruling, a major uptick in fundraising, though she hasn\u2019t yet had to file campaign finance statements that would confirm the numbers. Hobbs is a former social worker who worked with people experiencing homelessness and later was a lobbyist for a domestic violence shelter. She was elected to the Legislature in 2010, running on a slate with now-U.S. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema to represent the same central Phoenix district, Hobbs in the House and Sinema in the Senate. \u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re confident that sanity will beat chaos and Sec. Hobbs will be elected in November,\u201d Hobbs campaign manager Nicole DeMont said in a statement to The Associated Press. The race for governor is closer than the race for Senate because Hobbs faces a tougher matchup, said Chad Campbell, a Democratic consultant and former Arizona legislator. Lake is a stronger candidate than Masters, he said. \u201cKari Lake is a better version of Trump,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cShe\u2019s a more polished, better looking version of Donald Trump.\u201d It also helps Kelly that Senate races attract significantly more money than campaigns for governor, allowing Kelly and Democratic allies to relentlessly attack Masters, who is struggling to keep up financially. The Senate race also has a Libertarian candidate who could draw votes from right-leaning voters. Independent voters make up a third of the electorate in Arizona and hold the keys to statewide victories. They often split their tickets, electing Sinema to the Senate and Republican Doug Ducey as governor in 2018. Two years later, they propelled Kelly to a 2.4 percentage point victory while Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden eked out a 0.3 point win, the closest margin of any state he won. Republicans ran the table on the rest of the ballot. Hobbs became the undisputed Democratic frontrunner last year when she forcefully defended the 2020 election as Trump supporters oversaw a discredited recount of ballots in Maricopa County on behalf of state Senate Republicans. But she\u2019s struggled to translate her defense of democracy into a firm position of strength. Her own missteps haven\u2019t helped. Late last year, a jury for a second time sided with a Black former legislative aide, Talonya Adams, who said she wasfired for discriminatory reasonsin 2015, when Hobbs was the top Democrat in the Senate. Hobbs testified that she made a group decision with two others to fire Adams. Hobbs at first defended the decision and deflected responsibility, blaming Republicans for underpaying Adams. After a firestorm from Democrats who felt she was dismissive of workplace discrimination against people of color, Hobbsapologized to Adamsand said her initial response \u201cfell short of taking real accountability.\u201d Two-thirds of the Hobbs campaign staff quit this summer, telling the Arizona Agenda newsletter that the atmosphere was emotionally abusive. More recently, she\u2019s faced an onslaught of criticism, even from allies, and weeks of negative headlines forher decision not to debate Lake. \u201cIt\u2019s bad for her not to,\u201d said Linda Martini, a Democratic volunteer from Phoenix who tried to share her opinion with Hobbs at a recent campaign event but was rebuffed by the candidate, who walked away. \u201cFurthermore, she could destroy her opponents. There\u2019s no doubt about it. And the people want to see her on TV.\u201d",

    "Trump files $475 million defamation lawsuit against CNN": [
        "October 4, 2022 GMT",
        " NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Former PresidentDonald Trumpon Monday sued CNN, seeking $475 million in damages, saying the network had defamed him in an effort to short-circuit any future political campaign. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, focuses primarily on the term \u201cThe Big Lie\u201d about Trump\u2019s false claims of widespread fraud that he says cost him the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden. CNN said it had no comment on the lawsuit. Trump repeatedly attacked CNN as president, which resonated with his conservative followers. He has similarly filed lawsuits against big tech companies with little success. His case against Twitter for knocking him off its platform following the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S.Capitol insurrectionwas thrown out by a California judge earlier this year. Numerous federal and local election officials in both parties, a long list of courts, top former campaign staffers and even Trump\u2019s own attorney general have all said there is no evidence of the election fraud he alleges. Trump\u2019s lawsuit claims \u201cThe Big Lie,\u201d a phrase with Nazi connotations, has been used in reference to him more than 7,700 times on CNN since January 2021. \u201cIt is intended to aggravate, scare and trigger people,\u201d he said. In a statement Monday, Trump suggested that similar lawsuits would be filed against other news organizations. And he said he may also bring \u201cappropriate action\u201d against the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol by his supporters. The lawsuit comes as he is weighing a potential bid for the presidency in 2024. New CNN chief Chris Licht privately urged his news personnel in a meeting more than three months ago to refrain from using the phrase because it is too close to Democratic efforts to brand the former president, according to several published reports.",

    "Nevada county\u2019s plans to hand-count early ballots challenged": [
        "By GABE STERNOctober 4, 2022 GMT",
        " RENO, Nev. (AP) \u2014 A rural county in Nevada where conspiracy theories about voting machines run deep is planning to start hand-counting its mail-in ballots two weeks beforeElection Day,a process that risks public release of early voting results. Several voting and civil rights groups said Monday they objected to the proposal and will consider legal action if Nye County pushes ahead with its plan. Nevada is one of 10 states that allow local election offices to begin tabulating ballots before Election Day, but the machines that typically do that are programmed not to release results. Nye County officials are planning a full hand-count in addition to a primary machine tabulation for the November election. The move was prompted by unfounded claims of fraud involving voting machines in the 2020 presidential election. Nye County Clerk Mark Kampf said hand-count teams will start tallying mail-in ballots on Oct. 26, just under two weeks ahead of Election Day. Hand-count tallies are done publicly for transparency, with observers in the room. That raises the possibility that someone keeping score could make early results from the count public before most voters have even cast their ballot, voting experts said. \u201cWhen you are releasing results early, there is the potential for manipulative release, intended to try to impact turnout,\u201d said Gowri Ramachandran, a senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, which wrote a letter objecting to Nye County\u2019s plan. Results that change over time also sow distrust of the process. \u201cYou can cause people to be confused about whether results are accurate,\u201d she said. The Brennan Center and ACLU of Nevada say making any results public before voting ends on Election Day violates state law. Athar Haseebullah, executive director of the ACLU\u2019s Nevada chapter, said Monday that a lawsuit against the county \u201cmight be coming sooner rather than later.\u201d The Nye County commission has been pushing ahead with its plan to adopt a hand count of all ballots along with the primary machine tally for the Nov. 3 general election, a decision fueled byunfounded conspiracy theoriesabout its Dominion voting system. Kampf said he did not share the same concerns as the voting groups about the early release of partial results. \u201cThey\u2019re only going to get a small piece of the result, and so no one sees the total result in any place,\u201d he said in a brief interview Monday. Nye County Commissioner Debra Strickland said Kampf has the commission\u2019s support because he \u201chas decided to do as we\u2019ve requested.\u201d Nye County originally was going to start hand-counting both mail ballots and early in-person ballots on Oct. 25, but scrapped that plan after realizing it violated a Nevada statute that says counting early in-person ballots cannot begin until Election Day. Mark Wlaschin, Nevada\u2019s deputy secretary of state for elections, said he has been in touch with Kampf about the county\u2019s plans. Asked about concerns that the early hand-count of mail ballots could lead to results being released before Election Day, Wlaschin said it was a \u201cgood consideration\u201d and he would bring it up with Kampf. Under Nye County\u2019s plan, hand-count teams of five will include a reader who announces each result, a verifier who looks over the reader\u2019s shoulder and three talliers who write down the results. The talliers then compare their results before submitting them. They count in batches of 50 ballots and public observers are allowed in. Hand-counting is mostly used in small townships across New England and rural Wisconsin. There are 658 jurisdictions in the continental U.S. that rely exclusively on hand-counting, with the vast majority having fewer than 2,000 registered voters, according to data from Verified Voting, a group that tracks voting equipment across states. The most populous county in the continental U.S. to use only hand-counting is Owyhee County, Idaho, which had 6,315 registered voters as of 2020. Nye County has over 33,000 registered voters, raising questions about whether a full hand count can be completed before the state deadline to certify the election results. Nevada\u2019s least populous county, Esmeralda, used hand-counting to certify June\u2019s primary results, when officials spent more than seven hours counting just 317 ballots. Kampf was appointed county clerk after the long-time clerk resigned in July, a decision she made afterelection conspiracies spread throughout the county and the board of commissioners voted unanimouslyto recommend doing away with voting machines and count all ballots by hand. He has worked alongside Republican secretary of state candidate Jim Marchant, who helped organize the America First Secretary of State Coalition, a group of candidates running to be their state\u2019s top election official who have repeated Trump\u2019sfalse claimsabout widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Marchant aims to scrap early voting and voting machines. ___ Associated Press writer Christina A.

    "Biden tells Puerto Ricans he\u2019s \u2018committed to this island\u2019": [
        "By SEUNG MIN KIM, DARLENE SUPERVILLE and DANICA COTOOctober 3, 2022 GMT",
        " PONCE, Puerto Rico (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden promised to \u201crebuild it all\u201d while visiting Puerto Rico on Monday, as tens of thousands of peopleremain without powertwo weeks after Hurricane Fiona struck and residents worry that Washington\u2019s dedication to their recovery could prove fleeting. \u201cI\u2019m committed to this island,\u201d he said after receiving a briefing from local officials, acknowledging that Fiona was only the latest in a string of disasters that have pummeled the U.S. territory in recent years. \u201cPuerto Ricans are a strong people,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut even so, you have had to bear so much, and more than need be, and you haven\u2019t gotten the help in a timely way.\u201d The damage from Fiona, which came only five years after the even more powerful Hurricane Maria, will test his administration\u2019s ability to help the island of 3.2 million people recover and bolster its defenses. Puerto Rico has a higher poverty rate than any state, and it remains vulnerable to storms that are only becoming more powerful and frequent as climate change continues. \u201cWhat happened with this hurricane is that even though it was Category 1, in terms of water it was like Category 4,\u201d Puerto Rico\u2019s governor, Pedro Pierluisi, told Biden. Fiona made landfall on Sept. 18, knocking out power to the entire island. Although electricity has been restored to 90% of its 1.47 million customers, more than 137,000 others, mostly in the hardest hit areas of Puerto Rico\u2019s southern and western regions,continue to strugglein the dark. Another 66,000 customers are without water. The weather remained ominous during Biden\u2019s visit on Monday. Thunder rumbled and lightning flashed in the distance. \u201cI don\u2019t want the headline to read, \u2018Biden brings storm to Puerto Rico,\u2019\u201d he joked. \u201cSo I\u2019m gonna maybe have to cut this a little short.\u201d Biden announced the administration will provide $60 million through last year\u2019sbipartisan infrastructure lawto help Puerto Rico shore up levees, strengthen flood walls and create a new flood warning system so the island will be better prepared for future storms. Puerto Rico isn\u2019t the only corner of the country that\u2019s reeling from disaster. Florida is cleaning up after Hurricane Ian churned across that state last week, killing more than 60 people, decimating some coastal communities and flooding others. Biden plans to visit Florida on Wednesday to survey damage. \u201cAt times like these, our nation comes together, puts aside our political differences and gets to work,\u201d Biden said. The president was accompanied by first lady Jill Biden, who joined volunteers in a sweltering school gymnasium. She helped stuff plastic bags with canned goods, fruit cups, snack packages and rice. Pallets of bottled water were stacked along the wall. Little storm damage was visible during Biden\u2019s few hours on the ground in Puerto Rico after he touched down in Ponce, a city on the southern coast. Fiona caused catastrophic flooding, tore apart roads and bridges, and unleashed more than 100 landslides when it hit Puerto Rico on Sept. 18. At least two people died after being swept away by floods, and several others were killed in accidents related to the use of candles or generator during the island-wide power outage. Government officials have estimated some $3 billion in damages, but warn that costs could rise significantly as evaluations continue. Some people in Puerto Rico wondered whether Biden\u2019s visit would change anything as they recalled how President Donald Trump visited after Hurricane Maria hit as a more powerful Category 4 storm in 2017, and tossed rolls of paper towels into a crowd in a display that riled many. \u201cWe know that there may have been some issues in the previous administration,\u201d said Deanne Criswell, the Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator who joined Biden on his trip. \u201cWe are laser-focused on giving them the support they need.\u201d Criswell, who said FEMA personnel were sent to the island before the storm and will remain there to help with recovery, visited Puerto Rico shortly after Fiona struck. \u201cThey finally feel like this administration cares for them, and that they\u2019re going to be there for them to support them through this response and recovery effort,\u201d she said. There\u2019s entrenched skepticism in some areas of the island that anything will change. Manuel Veguilla, a 63-year-old retired mechanic who lives in a remote community in the hard-hit northern mountain town of Caguas, said he didn\u2019t expect his life to improve in the aftermath of Fiona, which cut off his neighborhood from any help for a week. \u201cThey always offer the lollipop to the kids,\u201d he said, referring to Biden\u2019s visit. \u201cBut in the end, the outcome is always the same. The aid goes to those who have the most.\u201d Biden recently told Pierluisi that he authorized 100% federal funding for 30 days for debris removal, search and rescue efforts, power and water restoration, shelter and food. Pierluisi asked for the funding to last for 180 days. In his remarks, Biden said, \u201cI\u2019m confident we\u2019re going to be able to do all you want, governor.\u201d The lack of electrical power on the island led to the temporary closure of businesses, including gas stations and grocery stores, as fuel supplies dwindled amid heavy generator use. As a result, many cheered the Biden administration\u2019s decision to temporarily waive a federal law so that a British Petroleum ship could deliver 300,000 barrels of diesel. Many also have begun demanding that Puerto Rico be fully exempted from the law, known asthe Jones Act, that requires that all goods transported to Puerto Rico be aboard a ship built in the U.S., owned and crewed by U.S. citizens and flying the U.S. flag. This drives up costs for an island that already imports 85% of its food. ___ Superville reported from Washington. Coto reported from San Juan, Puerto Rico.

    "Oath Keepers trial: Jan. 6 was \u2018rebellion,\u2019 prosecutor says": [
        "By ALANNA DURKIN RICHER, MICHAEL KUNZELMAN and LINDSAY WHITEHURSTOctober 3, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The founder of the Oath Keepers extremist group and four associates planned an \u201carmed rebellion\u201d to keepPresident Donald Trumpin power, a federal prosecutor contended Monday as themost serious case yetwent to trial in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Stewart Rhodes and his band of extremists were prepared to go to war to stop Joe Biden from becoming president, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Nestler told jurors. The group celebrated the Capitol attack as a victory in that fight and continued their plot even after Biden\u2019s electoral victory was certified, Nestler alleged. \u201cTheir goal was to stop, by whatever means necessary, the lawful transfer of presidential power, including by taking up arms against the United States government,\u201d the prosecutor said during his opening statement. \u201cThey concocted a plan for armed rebellion to shatter a bedrock of American democracy.\u201d The defendants are the first among hundreds of people arrested in the Capitol riot to stand trial onseditious conspiracy, a rare Civil War-era charge that calls for up to 20 years behind bars. The stakes are high for the Justice Department, which last secured such a conviction at trial nearly 30 years ago, and intends to try two more groups on the charge later this year. The trial comes as Trump continues to insist, against much evidence, that the 2020 election was stolen from him, and as vocal pushback against the charges filed against those who entered the Capitol continues in some quarters. The broader reaction could show how the American public, as well as the jury, sees the attack, nearly two years later. Defense attorneys accused prosecutors of cherry-picking comments from messages and videos and said the government has no evidence there ever was any plan to attack the Capitol. Rhodes\u2019 attorneysaid his client will take the standand show that the Oath Keepers had merely been preparing for orders they expected from Trump but never came. \u201cStewart Rhodes meant no harm to the Capitol that day. Stewart Rhodes did not have any violent intent that day,\u201d Rhodes\u2019 attorney, Phillip Linder, said. \u201cThe story the government is trying to tell you today is completely wrong.\u201d On trial with Rhodes, of Granbury, Texas, are Kelly Meggs, leader of the Florida chapter of the Oath Keepers; Kenneth Harrelson, another Florida Oath Keeper; Thomas Caldwell, a retired U.S. Navy intelligence officer from Virginia, and Jessica Watkins, who led an Ohio militia group. They face several other charges as well. They are among roughly 900 people who have been charged in the attack, which temporarily halted the certification of Biden\u2019s victory, sent lawmakers running for cover and left dozens of police officers injured. In the Oath Keepers case, prosecutors will try to prove that their actionswere not a spontaneous outpouring of election-fueled rage but part of a detailed, drawn-out plot to stop Biden from entering the White House. The Oath Keepers \u201cwere prepared in November, they were prepared in December and when the opportunity finally presented itself on Jan 6, 2021, they sprang into action,\u201d Nestler said. Rhodes began plotting to overturn Biden\u2019s victory right after the election, Nestler said. In November 2020, Rhodes sent his followers a step-by-step plan for stopping the transfer of power based on a popular uprising that brought down Yugoslavia\u2019s president two decades earlier. Around the same time, Rhodes was also communicating in another internet group \u2014 which included Trump ally Roger Stone \u2014 that was called \u201cFOS,\u201d or \u201cFriends of Stone,\u201d according to testimony. On Nov. 7, 2020, Rhodes said in a message to that group that he was on his way to D.C. for a possible \u201cop\u201d and was available to meet \u201cface-to-face.\u201d As December approached, Rhodes\u2019 rhetoric became increasingly violent and desperate, Nestler said. In messages and comments read to the jury, the Oath Keepers repeatedly warned of violence if Biden were to become president. During a December interview, Rhodes called senators \u201ctraitors\u201d and warned that the Oath Keepers would have to \u201coverthrow, abort or abolish Congress.\u201d He described Jan. 6 as a \u201chard constitutional deadline\u201d for stopping the transfer of power. The Oath Keepers organized training, including one session on \u201cunconventional warfare.\u201d Before coming to Washington, they stashed \u201cweapons of war\u201d at a Virginia hotel to serve as \u201cquick reaction force\u201d that could get guns into the capital quickly if necessary, the prosecutor said. As Oath Keepers stormed the Capitol in helmets and other battle gear, Rhodes remained on the outside, like \u201ca general surveying his troops on a battlefield,\u201d Nestler said. After the attack, the elated Oath Keepers went to a Virginia restaurant to celebrate their victory, the prosecutor said. In the days between the riot and Biden\u2019s inauguration, Rhodes spent more than $17,000 on firearm parts, ammunition and other items, prosecutors say. Shortly after the insurrection, Rhodes was secretly recorded saying that his \u201conly regret is that they should have brought rifles,\u201d Nestler said. Among those who may testify during the trial, which will last several weeks, are three Oath Keepers who\u2019ve pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy and are cooperating with prosecutors in hopes of getting lighter sentences. They include a man who says that after arriving in Washington, Meggs told him that another Florida Oath Keeper had brought explosives in his RV. The government\u2019s first witness was a FBI agent, who responded on Jan. 6 to help rescue senators. He described lawmakers crying, broken doors and windows and a scene that \u201clooked like a bomb had gone off.\u201d Defense lawyers say prosecutors have ripped the Oath Keepers\u2019 messages out of context to paint them unfairly. The Oath Keepers came to Washington to provide security at events for figures such as Stone before the president\u2019s big outdoor rally behind the White House, defense lawyers said. Rhodes\u2019 attorney described the group as a \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d force and called his client an \u201cextremely patriotic\u201d man who \u201cloves this country.\u201d Rhodes\u2019 attorneys plan to argue that Rhodes believed Trump was going to going to invoke the Insurrection Act and call up a militia, which Rhodes had been calling on him to do to stop Biden from becoming president. Rhodes\u2019 lawyers have said he was merely lobbying the president to invoke a U.S. law. Prosecutors say it\u2019s clear the Oath Keepers were going to act regardless of what Trump did. Nestler told jurors that Rhodes, a Yale Law School graduate, was only using the Insurrection Act as \u201clegal cover.\u201d In one message, Rhodes wrote in December 2020 that Trump \u201cneeds to know that if he fails to act, then we will.\u201d An attorney for Caldwell said his client is a disabled veteran who didn\u2019t even know of the Oath Keepers until November 2020. The defense lawyer, David Fischer, called Jan. 6 a \u201cblack eye\u201d for the country, but said Caldwell merely came to Washington \u201con a date with his wife\u201d and wasn\u2019t een planning to go to the Capitol until Trump\u2019s speech on the Ellipse before the riot. \u201cMr. Caldwell couldn\u2019t storm his way out of a paper bag,\u201d Fischer said. \u201cI came here to clear his name.\u201d ___ This story has been corrected to reflect that there are five defendants, not five men, on trial. ___ For full coverage of the Capitol riot, go to https://www.apnews.com/capitol-siege More on Donald Trump-related investigations: https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump",

    "Trump rallies drift to fringe ahead of potential 2024 bid": [
        "By JILL COLVINOctober 3, 2022 GMT",
        " WARREN, Mich. (AP) \u2014 Paige Cole is one of the \u201cAnons.\u201d The mother of three from Eastpointe, Michigan, saysJoe Bidenis a sham president and believesDonald Trumpwill soon be reinstated to the White House to finish the remainder of Biden\u2019s term. \u201cHis whole inauguration was fake. He didn\u2019t have real military people. He had, like, fake badges, fake people. And Trump is actually our president,\u201d she said while waiting in line for his latest rally on Saturday at Macomb Community College. Wearing a pink \u201cTrump 2024\u201d hat and draped in a large \u201cTRUMP WON\u201d flag, Cole \u2014 a former Democrat who says she voted twice for Barack Obama \u2014 began to cry as she described the significance of Trump\u2019s return and the 1,000 years of peace she believes will be ushered in with it. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna change everything,\u201d she says, \u201clike we have never in humanity seen before.\u201d Trump\u2019s rallies have always attracted a broad swath of supporters, from first timers taking advantage of their chance to see a president in person, todevotees who camp out for daysand follow him around the country like rock band groupies. But after spending much of the last two years obsessively peddling false claims of a stolen election, Trump is increasingly attracting those who have broken with reality, including adherents of the baseless QAnon conspiracy, which began in the dark corners of the internet and is premised on the belief that the country is run by a ring of child sex traffickers, satanic pedophiles and cannibals that only Trump can defeat. As he eyes another White House bid, Trump is increasinglyflirting with the conspiracy. He\u2019s reposted Q memes on his social media platform and amplified users who have promoted the movement\u2019s slogans, videos and imagery. And in recent weeks, he has been closing out his rally speeches with an instrumental song that QAnon adherents have claimed as their anthem and renamed \u201cWWG1WGA\u201d after the group\u2019s \u201cWhere we go one, we go all\u201d slogan. Trump and his allies often dismiss suggestions that he advances conspiracy theories or condones violence. \u201cThe continued attempts by the media to invent and amplify conspiracies, while also fanning the flames of division, is truly sick,\u201d his spokesperson, Taylor Budowich, said in a statement. \u201cAmerica is a nation in decline and our people are suffering, President Trump and his America First movement will not be distracted by the media\u2019s nonsense, and he will instead continue fighting to Make America Great Again.\u201d But interviews with more than a dozen Michigan rallygoers Saturday underscore his influence and serve as a reminder that many cling to his every word and see his actions as validation. Several of those interviewed said they only began attending Trump\u2019s rallies after the 2020 election, when they said they had become more politically engaged. Several, like Virginia Greenlee, of Holland, Michigan, said they had been in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021, when Trump supporters violently stormed the U.S. Capitol, trying to halt the peaceful transition of power by disrupting the certification of Biden\u2019s win. \u201cPresident Trump really woke people up because I didn\u2019t even know there was a deep state or fake media, fake news, until he started bringing light,\u201d said Greenlee, who said she did not go inside the building but watched from outside. She blamed the violence on leftist protesters masquerading as Trump supporters, though there is no evidence to support that claim. Meanwhile, Trump continues to elevate those who peddle conspiracies. Mike Lindell, the MyPillow salesman who has spent millions trying (and failing) to prove the election was stolen, spoke twice Saturday \u2014 once outside to attendees waiting in line to enter and again during the rally program. Also in attendance was Marjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right Georgia congresswoman who told the crowd that \u201cDemocrats want Republicans dead. And they\u2019ve already started the killings.\u201d Trump has long used angry and violent rhetoric to rile up his supporters, even after Jan. 6 made clear that some may act on that anger. As he inches closer to a possible announcement, Trump has leaned into the kind of racist and violent language that helped him clinch victory in 2016, when his ever-more-shocking statements \u2014 and the inevitable backlash \u2014 helped him dominate the news. On Friday, he again attacked Mitch McConnell, this time in a racist post on his social media site that accused the Senate Republican leader of having a \u201cdeath wish\u201d and derided McConnell\u2019s wife, who was born in Taiwan and served in Trump\u2019s administration as a Cabinet secretary. On Saturday, the crowd cheered enthusiastically as Trump touted plans to use the death penalty to kill drug dealers and traffickers if he returns to the White House, emulating the strongman leaders he\u2019s often admired. And again, he empathized with the Jan. 6 defendants who have been jailed for their role in the insurrection, casting the rioters \u2014 whom he has alreadypledged to pardonif he runs and wins \u2014 as \u201cpolitical prisoners\u201d and accusing authorities of \u201cpersecuting people who just happened to be there, many of them didn\u2019t even go in.\u201d The crowd in turn, broke into numerous \u201cLock her up!\u201d chants directed at Trump\u2019s 2016 Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, as well as the state\u2019s Democratic governor, secretary of state and attorney general, whom his endorsed candidates are trying to unseat. Still, Trump aides seem to want to have it both ways. As he began to wrap up his speech, some in the crowd raised their index fingers in what has been described as a QAnon salute. But for the second week in a row, burly event staff with tattoos carefully scanned the crowd, quickly asking those who raised their fingers to put them down. \u201cThey said they didn\u2019t want hands in the air,\u201d one of them explained he\u2019d been told. Still, Trump\u2019s nods to QAnon are encouraging to people like Cole, who said Trump had opened her eyes \u201cto everything, to the evil in the world.\u201d A 55-year-old semi-retired certified nursing assistant who relies on a bevy of fringe podcasts for information since eschewing cable news, Cole believes \u201cour money\u2019s no good because it was controlled by the Rothschilds,\u201d an anti-Semitic trope, and that the Supreme Court has \u201calready overturned\u201d the 2020 election, but \u201cthey\u2019re just sitting on it and they\u2019re waiting for things to come about.\u201d \u201cWe have to listen to underground news to get the truth of what\u2019s going on, really,\u201d she said. Trump\u2019s decision to play the song, she said after the rally, shows the American people \u201cand all those affiliated and committed in with the WWG1WGA bond and mission, that President Trump, too, is doing his best to help all involved to eradicate worldwide evil and helping to make the world better for all. It brings me strength in my mind to hold onto the hope and promises for a better life for all.\u201d But some in the crowd voiced discomfort. Christina Whipkey, 50, who lives in Warren, Michigan, said she found Trump\u2019s flirtations with QAnon \u201ckind of weird\u201d and \u201codd\u201d and worried their presence at his rallies was playing into negative stereotypes. \u201cI didn\u2019t like that,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s telling people what they said about us all along, that we\u2019re all just a bunch of QAnon supporters.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t want people to think just because you support him that you\u2019re that far into it, that you\u2019re one of those people,\u201d she went on. \u201cYou don\u2019t want people to think that about you.\u201d A longtime Trump supporter who remembers talking about him running for president while playing his board game in high school, Whipkey also said she thinks it\u2019s time for Trump to move on from the 2020 election, even if she has concerns about the vote. \u201cI just wish he\u2019d let that go now. Focus more on the future than on the past,\u201d she said, worried he was turning off potential voters. \u201cThey\u2019re tired of hearing it ... You get to a point where it\u2019s like, \u2018All right, buddy. We heard it enough. We got it. We know.\u2019\u201d Laurie Letzgus, 51, a machine operator from Port Huron, Michigan, and another longtime supporter, agreed. \u201cIt is time to move on, I think,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s look forward. And let\u2019s look to 2024.\u201d But Sharon Anderson, a member of the \u201cFront Row Joes\u201d group that travels the country to see Trump and who was attending her 29th rally Saturday, including the one held Jan. 6, disagreed. While she doesn\u2019t \u201cput a lot of faith in some of their beliefs,\u201d she took no issue with QAnon\u2019s growing presence at the rallies. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people, a big group that comes to his rallies. And they are for him, too. They\u2019re for his policies. Now whether they are trying to push their beliefs, I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Anderson, who lives in East Tennessee. \u201cBut I do know that everybody here that I\u2019ve encountered supports Donald J. Trump. That\u2019s what matters.\u201d",

    "Officials: US to send Ukraine more advanced rocket systems": [
        "By LOLITA C. BALDOR and MATTHEW LEEOctober 3, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The U.S. will soon deliver to Ukraine four more of the advanced rocket systems credited with helping the country\u2019s military gain momentum in its war with Russia. The High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, known as HIMARS, will be part of a new $625 million package of aid expected to be announced on Tuesday, according to U.S. officials. The decision marks the first time the U.S. has sent more HIMARS to Ukraine since late July, and it will bring the total number delivered so far to 20. The systems have become a key tool in Ukraine\u2019s ability to strike bridges that Russia has used to supply its troops, enabling Ukrainian forces to make inroads in Russia-controlled regions. The U.S. in recent weeks also provided funding through a separate program \u2014 the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative \u2014 so another 18 HIMARS can be purchased through longer-term contracts. USAI funds are being used as part of the effort by the U.S. and Western allies to ensure Ukraine\u2019s forces are trained and equipped to defend their country in the years to come. But those contracts will take several years to fulfill. The latest aid package is also expected to include other ammunition and equipment for Ukraine\u2019s troops. Several U.S. officials spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details of the package ahead of the announcement. This is the first tranche of U.S. aid delivered in the new fiscal year, which began Oct. 1. Ukraine has pressed its counteroffensive in the Kherson region since the summer, relentlessly pummeling Russian supply lines and making inroads into Russian-held areas west of the Dnieper River. Ukrainian troops have been using the HIMARS to repeatedly hit the main bridge across the Dnieper and a dam that served as a second crossing. It also has struck pontoon bridges that Russia has used to supply its troops. Ukraine\u2019s battlefield successes in Kherson are notable since that is one of the four areas that Russia is in the process of annexing. A senior U.S. military official said Monday that the attacks by Ukrainian forces have forced Russia into a \u201cdefensive crouch\u201d in Kherson, hampering Russian efforts to resupply their frontline troops. The official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity to provide a U.S. military assessment of the war, said that so far the U.S. has seen only small numbers of Russian reinforcements coming into Ukraine in an effort to shore up their defenses. Russia has said it will mobilize upwards of 300,000 conscripts to send to Ukraine. The official also said that despite persistent Russian threats to use nuclear force, the U.S. has seen no moves by the Kremlin that would cause the U.S. to change its own nuclear posture.",

    "High court will hear social media terrorism lawsuits": [
        "October 3, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court said Monday it will hear two cases seeking to hold social media companies financially responsible for terrorist attacks. The cases are seen as an important test of the federal law that generally makes internet companies exempt from liability for the material users post on their networks. In the cases the court agreed to hear, relatives of people killed in terrorist attacks in France and Turkey had sued Google, Twitter, and Facebook. They accused the companies of helping terrorists spread their message and radicalize new recruits. One of the cases was thrown out, mostly under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, while the other was allowed to proceed. The court,which began its new term Monday, is expected to hear arguments in the cases this winter with decisions before the court recesses for the summer, usually in late June. One of the cases the justices will hear involves Nohemi Gonzalez, a 23-year-old U.S. citizen studying in Paris. The Cal State Long Beach student was one of 130 people killed in Islamic State group attacks in November 2015. The attackers struck cafes, outside the French national stadium and inside the Bataclan theater. Gonzalez died in an attack at La Belle Equipe bistro. Gonzalez\u2019s relatives sued Google, which owns YouTube, saying the platform had helped the Islamic State group by allowing it to post hundreds of videos that helped incite violence and recruit potential supporters. Gonzalez\u2019s relatives said that the company\u2019s computer algorithms recommended those videos to viewers most likely to be interested in them. But a judge dismissed the case and a federal appeals court upheld the ruling. The other case the court agreed to hear involves Jordanian citizen Nawras Alassaf. He died in the 2017 attack on the Reina nightclub in Istanbul where a gunman affiliated with the Islamic State killed 39 people. Alassaf\u2019s relatives sued Twitter, Google and Facebook for aiding terrorism, arguing that the platforms helped the Islamic State grow and did not go far enough in trying to curb terrorist activity on their platforms. A lower court let the case proceed. The cases are Reynaldo Gonzalez et al. v Google, 21-1333, and Twitter et al. v Mehier Taamneh, 21-1496.",

    "Georgia election probe enters new phase with search warrants": [
        "By KATE BRUMBACKOctober 3, 2022 GMT",
        " ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 The Georgia prosecutor investigating whether former President Donald Trump and his allies broke the law trying to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state is seeking search warrants in the case, a sign that thewide-ranging probehas entered a new phase. The revelation came Monday in acourt orderfiled by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney, who\u2019s overseeing the special grand jury seated to help the investigation. In an order sealing any search warrants and related documents from being made public, McBurney wrote that District Attorney Fani Willis\u2019 office is \u201cnow seeking to obtain and execute a series of search warrants, the affidavits for which are predicated on sensitive information acquired during the investigation.\u201d Disclosure of the information could compromise the investigation, McBurney wrote, \u201cby, among other things, causing flight from prosecution, destruction of or tampering with evidence, and intimidation of potential witnesses.\u201d It could also result in risks to the \u201csafety and well-being\u201d of people involved in the investigation, he wrote. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear who the targets of the search warrants are or whether any search warrants had yet to be approved by a judge. To obtain a search warrant, prosecutors must convince a judge they have probable cause that a crime occurred at the location where authorities want to search. As Willis\u2019 investigation ramps up, the public court filings in the case have provided a rare window into the workings of a special grand jury that meets behind closed doors. Willis, a Democrat, opened the investigation early last year, shortly after the release of a recording ofa Jan. 2, 2021, phone callin which Trump suggested that Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger could \u201cfind\u201d the votes needed to overturn his loss to Democrat Joe Biden. In addition to the Trump-Raffensperger call, Willis confirmed early on that she was investigatinga call that Republican U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina madeto Raffensperger, thesudden departure of the U.S. attorney in Atlantain early January 2021 and statements made during legislative committee meetings by people pushing debunked claims casting doubt on the legitimacy of the state\u2019s election. Court filings in recent months have also shown that Willis is interested in a slate of fake electors who signed a certificate in December 2020 falsely stating that Trump had won the state and that they were the state\u2019s \u201cduly elected and qualified\u201d electors. She said in a court filing that the 16 Georgia Republicans who signed that certificate have all been notified they are targets of the investigation, meaning they could face criminal charges. Attorneys for Rudy Giuliani, a former New York mayor and Trump lawyer, say theirclient has also been notified that he\u2019s a target of Willis\u2019 investigation. He appeared at state legislative committee hearings in December 2020 and made claims of election fraud in Georgia. Giuliani was also involved in coordinating the fake elector plan, Willis wrote in a court filing. Hetestified before the special grand juryin August. Willis\u2019 investigation has also expanded intoa breach of voting equipmentat the elections office in a rural Georgia county, some 200 miles southeast of Atlanta. Documents, emails, security video and deposition testimony produced in response to subpoenas in a long-running lawsuit have shown that lawyer Sidney Powell and other Trump allies hired a computer forensics team to go toCoffee Countyto make complete copies of data and software on elections equipment there. Willis isseeking testimony from Powelland has also requested documents from the company that employs the computer forensics team. Another thread Willis seems to be pursuing is alleged attempts to pressure a Fulton County election worker. A petition filed last month indicates shewants to question Harrison Floyd, a director of Black Voices for Trump. Willis said in the petition that Floyd and Trevian Kutti, whom Willis described as a Chicago-based \u201cpurported publicist,\u201d tried to pressure Ruby Freeman.Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea \u201cShaye\u201d Moss,were election workers falsely accused by Trump allies of pulling fraudulent ballots from a suitcase during ballot counting. As the investigation has progressed, a number of people who have been summoned to testifyhave tried to avoidtestifying. Most have been unsuccessful. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican who\u2019s facing a reelection challenge from Democrat Stacey Abrams,managed to delayhis testimony until after next month\u2019s election. Graham\u2019sattempt to fight his subpoenais currently pending before a federal appeals court. Willis has said in a court filing that she wants to talk to Graham about calls he made to Raffensperger and his staff in which he reportedly asked about \u201creexamining certain absentee ballots cast in Georgia in order to explore the possibility of a more favorable outcome for former President Donald Trump.\u201d Graham has denied any wrongdoing and said hisstatus as a senator shields himfrom having to testify. A number of high-ranking Georgia state officials,including Raffenspergerand Attorney General Chris Carr, have already testified before the special grand jury. Others in Trump\u2019s orbit who\u2019ve undergone questioning include attorneysJohn Eastmanand Kenneth Chesebro. And the panel is still expecting testimony from others, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. Willis has indicated she couldseek to compel testimony from Trumphimself. The former president hashired a legal team in Atlantaand last month disparaged the investigation as a \u201cstrictly political Witch Hunt!\u201d",

    "Top US regulators say crypto poses financial stability risks": [
        "By FATIMA HUSSEINOctober 3, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Top regulators on Monday recommended a series of new safeguards to ensure that a growing and unregulated cryptocurrency market doesn\u2019t imperil U.S. financial stability. Among seven major recommendations, regulators called on Congress to pass legislation that would address the systemic risks caused by the growth of stablecoins, which are a form of cryptocurrency pegged to the price of another financial asset, like the U.S. dollar or gold. Recent volatilityin the cryptocurrency market, especially in stablecoins, has made regulators particularly wary about the need for regulation as usage of the digital asset continues to grow. Members of the Financial Stability Oversight Council met Monday to approve the recommendations of a 125-page report created in response to President Joe Biden\u2019s Marchexecutive orderon digital assets. The report also calls for giving agencies greater regulatory power over cryptocurrencies and digital assets. The oversight council is an interagency group headed by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and includes Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the role of the council is to identify risks and emerging threats to U.S. financial stability. Powell, whohas recently saidstablecoins will need greater regulation as they become more widely used by consumers, said Monday that \u201cacting now will allow us to support responsible financial innovation while preserving financial stability.\u201d Yellen said, \u201cAs we\u2019ve painfully learned from history, innovation without adequate regulation can result in significant disruptions and harm to the financial system.\u201d At the start of the year, the council stated it would focus its efforts on researching and developing recommendations on digital asset issues, as more Americans invest in cryptocurrencies. Roughly 16% of adult Americans, or 40 million people, have invested in cryptocurrencies, according to a September 2021Pew Research Center poll. And 43% of men age 18-29 have put money into cryptocurrency. Last month, the Treasury Departmentissued a reportthat recommended the U.S. work on developing a digital dollar. Yellen said Treasury recommends that the U.S. \u201cadvance policy and technical work on a potential central bank digital currency, or CBDC, so that the United States is prepared if CBDC is determined to be in the national interest.\u201d More than 100 central banks around the world are considering a digital currency, but just a few have actually issued one.",

    "Supreme Court welcomes the public again, and a new justice": [
        "By JESSICA GRESKO and MARK SHERMANOctober 3, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014The Supreme Court began its new term Monday with a new justice on the bench,the public back in the courtroomand a spirited debate in a case that pits environmental protections against property rights. The new member of the court,Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, wasted no time engaging, asking questions throughout nearly two hours of arguments in the dispute over the nation\u2019s main anti-water pollution law, the Clean Water Act. Jackson, the court\u2019s first Black female justice, seemed to be generally aligned with the court\u2019s other liberal justices in favor of Justice Department arguments to preserve theauthority of the federal government to regulate wetlands under the Clean Water Act against a business-backed challenge. If Jackson was eager to show she was ready to participate, several conservative justices also provided a quick reminder of the balance of power on a court where they hold a 6-3 majority. They asked questions that were more skeptical of the regulation in a case that tests the reach of the law beyond rivers, lakes and streams. One issue in the case is how far wetlands can be from a larger body of water and still be subject to regulation. Jackson said she wanted to know \u201cwhy would Congress draw the coverage line between abutting wetlands and neighboring wetlands when the objective of the statute is to ensure the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation\u2019s waters?\u201d Under an opinion written by retired Justice Anthony Kennedy in 2006, regulators can require permits before allowing development on properties that don\u2019t abut waterways as long as they prove a significant connection to the waterways. Kennedy, who retired in 2018, was in the courtroom to hear some conservative justices appear to agree with the lawyer for an Idaho couple that Kennedy\u2019s opinion was vague and unworkable. Chief Justice John Roberts was unsatisfied by Justice Department lawyer Brian Fletcher\u2019s explanation of how to translate Kennedy\u2019s opinion into practice. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Roberts asked at one point. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, who once was a law clerk to Kennedy, also appeared inclined to side with Chantell and Michael Sackett, who have wanted to build a home close to Priest Lake in Idaho for 16 years and won an earlier round in their legal fight at the Supreme Court. Monday\u2019s arguments were the first time the justices were back hearing cases since issuing alandmark rulingstripping away women\u2019s constitutional protections for abortion. And for the first time in two and a half years, since thecourt closed in March 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic,the public was allowed inside the courtroom, although the court is continuing to provide live audio of arguments on its website. Because of the pandemic the court is still closed to the public outside of arguments. And two justices wore masks in court Monday: Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who has diabetes and has worn a mask in court consistently during the pandemic, and Justice Elena Kagan, who the court said tested negative for COVID-19 but had been exposed to someone with the virus. Anew stack of high-profile casesawaits the justices in the upcoming term. Several cases the court has agreed to hear involve race or elections or both, and the court has also agreed to hear a dispute that returns the issue of free speech and LGBTQ rights to the court. Also hanging over the justices is some unfinished business from last term: the leak of a draft of the abortion decision seven weeks before it was formally announced. Chief Justice John Roberts ordered an investigation, but the court has yet to provide an update. Jackson, for her part, has been waiting for months to fully begin her new rolesince being confirmed in Apriland sworn in whenJustice Stephen Breyer retired in June. Jackson\u2019s husband, Patrick, and her parents were in the audience Monday, as were the parents of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and his wife, Ashley. Jackson joins the court at a time of declining public support for the court. Polls following the court\u2019s abortion decision have shown a sharp drop in the court\u2019s approval rating and in people\u2019s confidence in the court as an institution. A poll over the summer found 43% of Americans saying they have hardly any confidence in the court, up from 27% earlier in the year. In addition to the abortion ruling, the court alsoexpanded gun rights,reined in the government\u2019s ability to fight climate changeand blocked a Biden administrationeffort to get workers at large companies vaccinated against COVID-19. This term\u2019s significant cases include a struggle over whether Alabama must draw an additional Black majority congressional district, set for arguments Tuesday, and a controversial Republican-led appeal that could dramatically change the way elections for Congress and the presidency are conducted by handing more power to state legislatures. There\u2019s also the case of a Colorado website designer who says her religious beliefs prevent her working with same-sex couples on their weddings. Next month, the justices will hear a challenge to the consideration of race in college admissions. ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court",

    "Interior Dept. to require body cams for law enforcement": [
        "By MICHAEL BALSAMOOctober 3, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The U.S. Interior Department on Monday launched a set of new policies that would require thousands of law enforcement officers to wear body cameras, ensures the release of footage in some critical incidents and restricts the use of so-called no-knock warrants. The announcement comes after Interior Secretary Deb Haaland launched a task force last year aimed at further building trust between law enforcement and the public. It also follows an executive order from President Joe Biden that focused on federal law enforcement agencies and required them to review and revise policies on use of force. The policies apply to the thousands of law enforcement officers who work for the Interior Department, in the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service. The agency has about 3,100 permanent law enforcement officers. While some federal agencies have already started launching body camera programs \u2013 including some park rangers, park police officers and Fish and Wildlife officers \u2013 the federal government has lagged behind many local police departments whose officers have been using body cameras for years. One of the new policies specifically requires all Interior Department law enforcement officers who are patrolling or engaging with the public to carry body-worn cameras and sets out the department\u2019s intent to expedite the public release of video after an incident that results in serious injury or death. Under the policy, officers or agents are required to activate the body-worn cameras \u201cat the earliest possible opportunity of an interaction and should capture as much of the event as possible, starting with the decision to engage an individual or vehicle.\u201d The camera should remain running until the event is over, the policy states. The policy says the Interior Department \u201cwill strive to expedite the public release\u201d of footage after incidents that involve \u201cserious bodily injury or death in order to promote transparency and accountability.\u201d The Interior Department\u2019s law enforcement arms have faced scrutiny in recent years, particularly the U.S. Park Police who werefaulted in an inspector general\u2019s reportafter officers used smoke grenades and pepper balls to clear racial justice protesters from an area in front of the White House in 2020. The agency also faced scrutiny over its lack of cameras after two U.S. Park Policeofficers fatally shot an unarmed motoristin northern Virginia in November 2017. Another of the policies restricts the use of \u201cno-knock\u201d warrants, which allow law enforcement agents to enter a home without announcing their presence. A no-knock warrant, as its name implies, is an order from a judge that allows police to enter a home without prior notification to the residents, such as ringing a doorbell or banging on the door. In most cases, the law requires that officers must knock and announce themselves before entering a private home to execute a search warrant. The updated policy \u2013 similar to thepolicy implemented by the Justice Departmentfor its officers last year \u2013 follows theMarch 2020 death of Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed by police in her home during a no-knock warrant and whose death led to months of mass protests over racial injustice in policing and the treatment of Black people in the United States. The policy curtails the use of no-knock entries to instances where announcing the presence of federal officers \u201cwould create an imminent threat of physical violence to the agent and/or another person,\u201d the Interior Department said. It also requires agents to first obtain approval from supervisors and a federal prosecutor before seeking a no-knock warrant. The new policies also provide additional guidance on use of force incidents, laying out that its policy would meet or exceed the policies set out by the Justice Department. It also requires the law enforcement agencies to collect and report data about the number of use of force incidents and reiterates a ban on carotid restraints and chokeholds, except when deadly force has been authorized. \u201cEvery single day across the country, the Interior Department\u2019s law enforcement officers risk their lives to safeguard our communities, public lands and waters, and critical resources,\u201d said Deputy Secretary Tommy Beaudreau. \u201cIn reforming policing practices, the Department is helping strengthen the unique connection that law enforcement officers have with the communities that they serve and move the nation forward towards community-focused law enforcement.\u201d",

    "The Oath Keepers\u2019 Capitol riot trial, explained": [
        "By LINDSAY WHITEHURST, ALANNA DURKIN RICHER and MICHAEL KUNZELMANOctober 3, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A trial that started this week in Washington, D.C., is the biggest test yet in the Justice Department\u2019s efforts to hold accountable those responsible for theattack on the Capitolon Jan. 6, 2021, a violent assault that challenged the foundations of American democracy. On trial is extremist leader Stewart Rhodes, founder of the Oath Keepers extremist group, and four associates. Prosecutors and defense attorneys are making their opening statements on Monday andthe trialwill last several weeks. Here is a look at what\u2019s to come: WHO ARE THE OATH KEEPERS? The extremist group was founded in 2009 by Rhodes who was educated at Yale Law School and served briefly as a U.S. Army paratrooper before a training accident left him with a back injury. The group was named after its stated goal of getting past and present members of the military, first responders and police officers to honor the promise they made to defend the Constitution against enemies. They issued a list of orders that its members wouldn\u2019t obey, such as disarming citizens, carrying out warrantless searches and detaining Americans as enemy combatants in violation of their right to jury trials. That benign framing and leveraging of social media helped the group grow to one of the country\u2019s largest groups in the antigovernment militia arena, but the internal dialog was often darker, experts said. Oath Keepers participated in the standoff with federal officials at Nevada\u2019s Bundy Ranch in 2014, and later along rooftops in Ferguson, Missouri, after a grand jury declined to charge a police officer in the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown. The group would eventually embrace much of former President Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric and false claims that the 2020 election was fraudulent. WHY ARE THEY ON TRIAL? On trial with Rhodes are Kelly Meggs, leader of the Florida chapter of the Oath Keepers; Kenneth Harrelson, another Florida Oath Keeper; Thomas Caldwell, a retired U.S. Navy intelligence officer from Virginia; and Jessica Watkins, who led an Ohio militia group. They have been charged with seditious conspiracy in one of the most high profile cases to come out of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Prosecutors say they spent several weeks amassing weapons, organizing paramilitary training and readying armed teams outside Washington to stop Joe Biden from becoming president. The plot came to a head on Jan. 6, 2021, when Oath Keepers wearing helmets and other battle gear were captured on camera shouldering their way through the crowd of angry Trump supporters and storming the Capitol in military-style stack formation. Prosecutors said that the insurrection, for the Oath Keepers, was not a spur-of-the-moment protest but part of a serious, weekslong plot to stop the transfer of power. Rhodes and his associates, for their part, say prosecutors have twisted their words and insist there was never any plan to attack the Capitol. They say they were in Washington to provide security and preparations, training, gear and weapons were to protect themselves against potential violence from left-wing antifa activists or to be ready ifTrump invoked the Insurrection Actto call up a militia. WHAT IS SEDITIOUS CONSPIRACY? Theseditious conspiracy lawwas enacted after the Civil War to arrest Southerners who might keep fighting the U.S. government. The charge has rarely been brought in recent history \u2014 with mixed results. In this case, prosecutors will try to prove that Rhodes and his associates conspired to forcibly oppose the authority of the federal government and forcibly block the execution of laws governing the transfer of presidential power. It can be tough to prove because prosecutors have to show the defendants did more than talk about using force, that they conspired to actually use it. The last seditious conspiracy cases were filed in 2010, and those ended in acquittal. The last successful seditious conspiracy trial was in 1995, when Egyptian cleric Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman and nine followers were convicted in a plot to blow up several landmarks in New York and New Jersey. It\u2019s punishable by up to 20 years behind bars.",

    "Russian court sets Brittney Griner appeal date for Oct. 25": [
        "By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOVOctober 3, 2022 GMT",
        " MOSCOW (AP) \u2014 A Russian court on Monday set Oct. 25 as the date for American basketball star Brittney Griner\u2019s appeal against her nine-year prison sentence for drug possession. Griner, an eight-time all-star center with the WNBA\u2019s Phoenix Mercury and a two-time Olympic gold medalist, was convicted Aug. 4 after police said they found vape canisters containing cannabis oil in her luggage at Moscow\u2019s Sheremetyevo Airport. The Moscow region court said it will hear her appeal. Griner admitted that she had the canisters in her luggage, but testified that she had inadvertently packed them in haste and that she had no criminal intent. Her defense team presented written statements that she had been prescribed cannabis to treat pain. Her February arrest came at a time of heightened tensions between Moscow and Washington, just days before Russia sent troops into Ukraine. At the time, Griner, recognized as one of the greatest players in WNBA history, was returning to Russia, where she played during the U.S. league\u2019s offseason. The nine-year sentence was close to the maximum of 10 years, and Griner\u2019s lawyers argued after the conviction that the punishment was excessive. They said in similar cases defendants have received an average sentence of about five years, with about a third of them granted parole. Before her conviction, the U.S. State Department declared Griner to be \u201cwrongfully detained\u201d \u2014 a charge that Russia has sharply rejected. Reflecting the growing pressure on the Biden administration to do more to bring Griner home, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken took the unusual step of revealing publicly in July that Washington had made a \u201csubstantial proposal\u201d to get Griner home, along with Paul Whelan, an American serving a 16-year sentence in Russia for espionage. Blinken didn\u2019t elaborate, but The Associated Press and other news organizations have reported that Washington has offered to exchange Griner and Whelan for Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer who is serving a 25-year sentence in the U.S. and once earned the nickname the \u201cmerchant of death.\u201d The White House said it has not yet received a productive response from Russia to the offer. Russian diplomats have refused to comment on the U.S. proposal and urged Washington to discuss the matter in confidential talks, avoiding public statements. U.S. President Joe Biden met last month with Cherelle Griner, the wife of Brittney Griner, as well as the player\u2019s agent, Lindsay Colas. Biden also sat down separately with Elizabeth Whelan, Paul Whelan\u2019s sister. The White House said after the meetings that the president stressed to the families his \u201ccontinued commitment to working through all available avenues to bring Brittney and Paul home safely.\u201d The Biden administration carried out a prisoner swap in April, with Moscow releasing Marine veteran Trevor Reed in exchange for the U.S. releasing a Russian pilot, Konstantin Yaroshenko, convicted in a drug trafficking conspiracy.",

The justices said Monday they would not intervene in a dispute between PAO Tatneft, one of Russia\u2019s largest oil companies, and Ukraine. The case will continue in lower U.S. courts which have sided with the company and declined to dismiss the case. As is typical, the high court did not comment on the case but said only it would not hear it. The dispute is one of many the court said Monday it would not hear. Monday is thefirst day the court is hearing argumentsafter a summer break. The case the court rejected dates back to the late 1990s and early 2000s and involves Ukraine\u2019s largest oil refinery, the Kremenchuk oil refinery,which was destroyed by Russia in April. The refinery was originally half-owned by Ukraine and half-owned jointly by Tatneft and by the oil-rich Russian region of Tatarstan. A dispute between the parties led to arbitration in which Ukraine was ordered in 2014 to pay $112 million plus interest. Tatneft has tried using courts in the United States to seek compensation, but Ukraine says the U.S. has no connection to the case. Lawyers for Ukraine say Tatneft should be using courts in Ukraine which, despite the war, \u201cremain open and would fairly consider Tatneft\u2019s request for relief.\u201d The case is Ukraine v.

    "Supreme Court leaves Don Blankenship conviction in place": [
        "October 3, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court says it won\u2019t review the conviction of former coal CEO Don Blankenship, who was found guilty of conspiring to violate safety standards at West Virginia\u2019s Upper Big Branch mine before the2010 explosion that killed 29 men. The justices said Monday they would not take the case of the former CEO of Massey Energy who spent a year in prison following his conviction stemming from the worst U.S. coal mining disaster in 40 years. That leaves in place lower court decisions rejecting his efforts to get his misdemeanor conviction thrown out. As is typical, the high court did not explain its decision and denied the case among a long list of others. Monday is thefirst day of the court\u2019s new term. A federal jury in West Virginiaconvicted Blankenship in 2015of conspiring to willfully violate mine safety standards but acquitted him of more serious charges. He was sentenced to a year in prison and fined $250,000. In 2019, however, a federal magistrate judge recommended thatBlankenship\u2019s conviction be thrown out. The judge agreed with Blankenship that his rights were violated because prosecutors didn\u2019t turn over evidence that was favorable to him. That included FBI and Department of Labor interviews with Massey employees. A government review separately found that some material should have been turned over. Afederal district judge, however, ruledthat despite the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose numerous documents, the conduct \u201dresulted in no prejudice\u201d toward Blankenship. Most of the substance of the documents that was favorable to Blankenship did come out at trial, the judge said. An appeals court also ruled against Blankenship before the Supreme Court declined to hear his case. Investigations into the Upper Big Branch mine disaster found that worn and broken cutting equipment created a spark that ignited accumulations of coal dust and methane gas. Broken and clogged water sprayers allowed what should have been a minor flare-up to become an inferno.",

        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court says it won\u2019t intervene in a lawsuit in which Dominion Voting Systems accused MyPillow chief executive Mike Lindell of defamation for falsely accusing the company of rigging the 2020 presidential election against former President Donald Trump. As is typical, the high court did not say anything Monday about the case in rejecting it among a host of others. Monday isthe first day the high court is hearing argumentsafter taking a summer break. Lindell is part of a case in which Dominion also accused Trump allies Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani of defamation for falsely claiming that the election was \u201cstolen.\u201d The Denver, Colorado-based Dominion has sought $1.3 billion in damages from the trio. A lower court judge in August of last yeardeclined to dismiss the caseand instead said it could go forward. Lindell had appealed that determination, but a federal appeals court said his appeal was premature. The Supreme Court declined to take up that issue. Powell and Giuliani, both lawyers who filed election challenges on Trump\u2019s behalf, and Lindell, who was one of Trump\u2019s most vocal public supporters, made various unproven claims about the voting machine company during news conferences, election rallies and on social media and television. There was no widespread fraud in the election, which a range of election officials across the country, including Trump\u2019s attorney general, William Barr, have confirmed. Republican governors in Arizona and Georgia, key battleground states crucial to Biden\u2019s victory, also vouched for the integrity of the elections in their states. Dominion machines tabulated ballots in 28 states. In September, a judge in Minnesota declined to dismiss a separate defamation lawsuit by a different voting machine maker, Smartmatic, against Lindell.

        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court said Monday it won\u2019t take up two cases that involved challenges to aban enacted during the Trump administrationon bump stocks, the gun attachments that allow semi-automatic weapons to fire rapidly like machine guns. The justices\u2019 decision not to hear the cases comes on the heels ofa decision in June inwhich the justices by a 6-3 vote expanded gun-possession rights, weakening states\u2019 ability to limit the carrying of guns in public. The cases the justices declined to hear were an appeal from aUtah gun rights advocateand another brought by the gun rights group Gun Owners of America and others. As is typical the justices made no comments in declining to hear the cases and they were among many the court rejected Monday,the first day of the court\u2019s new term. The Trump administration\u2019s ban on bump stocks took effect in 2019 and came about as a result of the 2017 massshooting in Las Vegas.The gunman, a 64-year-old retired postal service worker and high stakes gambler, used assault-style rifles to fire more than 1,000 rounds in 11 minutes into the crowd of 22,000 music fans. Most of the rifles were fitted with bump stock devices and high-capacity magazines. A total of 58 people were killed in the shooting and two died later. More than 850 people were injured. The Trump administration\u2019s move was an about-face for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. In 2010, under the Obama administration, the agency found that bump stocks should not be classified as a \u201cmachinegun\u201d and therefore should not be banned under federal law. Under the Trump administration, officials revisited that determination and found it incorrect. The high court previously declined a different opportunity to takea case involving the ban. The cases the court rejected Monday are W. Clark Aposhian v. Merrick B. Garland, 21-159, and Gun Owners of America v. Merrick B. Garland, 21-1215.",

    "Black representation in Alabama tested before Supreme Court": [
        "By KIM CHANDLER, MARK SHERMAN and GARY FIELDSOctober 3, 2022 GMT",
        " MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) \u2014 The invisible line dividing two of Alabama\u2019s congressional districts slices through Montgomery, near iconic sites from the civil rights movement as well as ones more personal to Evan Milligan. There\u2019s the house where his grandfather loaded people into his station wagon and drove them to their jobs during the Montgomery Bus Boycott as Black residents spurned city buses to protest segregation. It\u2019s the same home where his mother lived as a child, just yards from a whites-only park and zoo she was not allowed to enter. The spot downtown where Rosa Parks was arrested, igniting the boycott, sits on one side of the dividing line while the church pastored by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., who led the protests, sits on the other. The lines are at the center of a high-stakes redistricting case bearing Milligan\u2019s name that will go beforethe U.S. Supreme Courton Tuesday, setting up a new test of the Voting Rights Act and the role of race in drawing congressional boundaries. At the center of the case is a challenge by various groups arguing that the state violated the federal Voting Rights Act bydiluting the political power of Black voterswhen it failed to create a second district in which they make up a majority, or close to it. African Americans account for about 27% of the state\u2019s population but are the majority in just one of the state\u2019s seven congressional districts. \u201cOur congressional map is not reflective of the population that lives in Alabama,\u201d said Milligan, 41, one of several voters who joined interest groups in filing the lawsuit. The case the Supreme Court will take up Tuesday centers on whether congressional districts in Alabama were drawn to reduce the political influence of Black voters, but it\u2019s also part of a much broader problem that undermines representative government in the U.S. Both major political parties have practiced gerrymandering \u2014 drawing congressional and state legislative boundaries to cement their hold on power \u2014 but Republicans have been in control of the processin far more statessince after the 2010 elections. That has allowed them to win an outsized share of statehouse and U.S. House seats and means GOP policies \u2014 includingon abortion restrictions\u2014 often don\u2019t reflectthe will of most voters. An Associated Pressanalysis from 2017showed that Alabama had one of the most gerrymandered congressional maps in the country. Republicans dominate elected office in Alabama and are in charge of redistricting. They have been resistant to creating a second district with a Democratic-leaning Black majority that could send another Democrat to Congress. A three-judge panel that included two appointees of President Donald Trumpruled unanimously in Januarythat the Alabama Legislature likely violated the Voting Rights Act with the map. \u201cBlack voters have less opportunity than other Alabamians to elect candidates of their choice to Congress,\u201d the panel said. The judges ordered state lawmakers to draw new lines for this year\u2019s election and create a second district where Black voters either made up a majority or near majority of the population. But on a 5-4 vote in February, the Supreme Court sided with Alabama to allow this year\u2019s congressional elections to take place without adding a second predominantly Black district. Two justices suggested it was too close to spring primaries to make a change. The lawsuit claims the Alabama congressional map dilutes the voting strength of Black residents by packing a large number of them into a single district \u2014 the 7th, where 55% of voters are Black \u2014 while fragmenting other communities. That includes the state\u2019s Black Belt region and the city of Montgomery. The current districts leave the vast majority of Black voters with no realistic chance to elect their preferred congressional candidates anywhere outside the 7th district, the lawsuit contends. \u201cThis is just about getting Black voters, finally, in Alabama the opportunity to elect their candidates of choice. It\u2019s not necessarily guaranteeing that they will have their candidate elected,\u201d said Deuel Ross, senior counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which is representing the plaintiffs. The groups contend that the state\u2019s Black population is large enough and geographically compact enough to create a second district. Milligan, who is six generations removed from enslaved ancestors who lived in the Black Belt, ticked off the consequences for Black residents who are not able to have representation that aligns with their needs: addressing generational poverty, the lack of adequate internet service, Medicaid expansion and the desire for a broader array of health care services. \u201cIn choosing not to do that, you\u2019re denying the people of the Black Belt the opportunity to elect an additional person that can really go to the mat on their interests,\u201d said Ross, who is one of the attorneys who will argue the case in a challenge backed by the Biden administration. ___ African Americans served in Alabama\u2019s congressional delegation following the Civil War in the period known as Reconstruction. They did not return until 1993, a year after the courts ordered the state to reconfigure the 7th Congressional District into a majority-Black one, which has since been held by a succession of Black Democrats. That 1992 map remains the basis for the one in use today. \u201cUnder numerous court challenges, the courts have approved this basic plan. All we did is adjust it for population deviation,\u201d said state Rep. Chris Pringle, a Republican and chairman of the legislative committee that drew the new lines. Alabama argued in court filings that the state\u2019s Black population is too spread out to be able to create a second majority district without abandoning core redistricting principles such as keeping districts compact and keeping communities of interest together. Drawing such a district, the state argued, would require mapping acrobatics, such as connecting coastal areas in southwest Alabama to peanut farms in the east. In a statement to The Associated Press, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said the map is \u201cbased on race-neutral redistricting principles that were approved by a bipartisan group of legislators.\u201d He said it looks similar to three prior maps, including one cleared by the Justice Department and another enacted in the 2000s by \u201cthe Democrat-controlled Legislature.\u201d \u201cThe Voting Rights Act does not force states to sort voters based on race,\u201d Marshall said in a statement. \u201cThe VRA is meant to prohibit racial gerrymanders, not require them.\u201d Standing in a meeting room at the Alabama Statehouse and pointing to a poster-size version of the map, Pringle said lawmakers prioritized a race-neutral approach. The lawsuit alleges the Republican lawmakers packed Black voters into certain areas, but Pringle said when they were drawing lines they \u201cturned race off\u201d as an option on the computer. Only later did they apply the racial data points. \u201cI think the Supreme Court is going to back us up that we complied with existing law,\u201d Pringle said. ___ Alabama\u2019s 7th Congressional District snakes a winding path from the western neighborhoods of Birmingham through the state\u2019s Black Belt \u2014 a swath of land named for the rich soil that once gave rise to antebellum plantations \u2014 to sections of Montgomery. Democratic Rep. Terri Sewell, who has represented the district, has been the lone Democrat among the state\u2019s seven House members since she took office in 2011. The state\u2019s other six districts have reliably elected white Republicans for the last decade. Sewell was the only member of Alabama\u2019s delegation to support restoring the most effective anti-discrimination provision of the Voting Rights Act, which was gutted in a 2013 Supreme Court decision that also arose from an Alabama case. The provision, referred to as preclearance, forced Alabama, other states and some counties with a history of voting discrimination to get Justice Department or federal court approval before making any election-related changes. Some Black voters outside Sewell\u2019s district say they feel their concerns are overlooked because there is no motivation for Republican officeholders in districts that favor the GOP to pay attention to their issues. \u201cFair representation and full representation of the voters in the state of Alabama would mean that a third of the population should get a third of the representation in Congress, and that at least includes one additional seat,\u201d Sewell said. \u201cLook, I think that I would welcome the opportunity to have another seat where I have a colleague that will fight for, you know, voting rights and civil rights, that that will understand that this country has gotten far when it comes to diversity. But we have a long ways to go.\u201d Alabama\u2019s congressional delegation voted unanimously for the CARES Act, which provided federal aid to state and local governments during the Trump administration as the COVID-19 outbreak was erupting across the country. But that unity vanished when President Joe Biden took office. Sewell was alone in the delegation in supporting the American Rescue Plan, legislation passed by a Democratic-controlled Congress and signed by Biden. Among other things, she said, the bill benefited community health centers and the health care response at historically Black colleges. One of them, Alabama State University, was founded two years after the Civil War and in an area where the districts divide. Sewell also was alone in supporting other significant legislation since Biden took office \u2014 including the $1 trillion infrastructure bill and the recent Inflation Reduction Act, which, among other provisions, capped out-of-pocket drug costs for Medicare recipients and helped millions of Americans afford health insurance by extending coverage subsidies. Those types of priorities speak to the Rev. Murphy Green, a local political activist who is supporting the long shot bid by the Democratic candidate in the race for the 2nd Congressional District, where the Republican incumbent won with 65% of the vote two years ago. He particularly pointed to the health care price controls enacted by Democrats, including for insulin. While diabetes also is a problem for white residents, it is especially systemic among Black people and the cost of drugs to combat it is a priority, Green said in an interview. \u201cI am a diabetic,\u201d he said. \u201cMy congressman voted against price controls on the cost of insulin.\u201d ___ Montgomery, which is split into two congressional districts, is a municipal version of the state when it comes to redistricting. From customers at a well-known barbershop to shoppers at a convenience store, from groups sitting in empty lots and residents in some of the neighborhoods that are being shifted, the question of who represents them in Congress and who will be on the ballot in November brings a range of answers. The 2nd Congressional District seat has been held by white Republicans for decades, except for two years when a conservative white Democrat got a bounce from turnout related to Democrat Barack Obama\u2019s presidential campaign in 2008. Of dozens of people approached, the majority are aware there is an Alabama case going to the Supreme Court, but they don\u2019t know details of the racial gerrymandering behind the case. Some are unaware of who their congressional representative has been. In Heritage Barber and Style Shop, a local Black barbershop that rides the line between the 2nd and 7th congressional districts and sits across from Alabama State, Stephen Myers, 77, talks about the state\u2019s maps and attempts to minimize Black voting strength. \u201cWhat\u2019s different?\u201d he said. In the decades he has lived in his home, Myers said he has never had the opportunity to cast a \u201cmeaningful\u201d vote for a Democrat. Keeping people motivated under those conditions is a challenge, he said. The operator of a civil rights site tour, Myers said he passed along the significance of voting to his children and grandchildren, but motivating the current generation? \u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d he said. The frustration is shared by the Rev. Benjamin Jones, who heads the St. James Missionary Baptist Church, a congregation of about 300 tucked into the former farmlands of east Montgomery County. He recalled the sacrifices of older generations during the civil rights movement. His father, for example, would attend protests and marches that sometimes ended with him going to jail, while his mother would stay home so she could bail him out. \u201cSo it is frustrating to know that people went through those type things, but seemingly in 2022 there hasn\u2019t been that much progress in the voting arena in terms of being able to elect people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about someone who shares your same skin tone, but someone who at least cares enough about your politics to be concerned about your issues.\u201d ___ The strategy to challenge a map with a safe majority-Black district comes with risks. As the case goes before the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, advocates fear an adverse ruling could affect future redistricting cases. Five conservative justices were in the majority in the February vote blocking the use of the map during this year\u2019s elections. A sixth, Chief Justice John Roberts, objected to the procedure his colleagues used to prevent the districts from being redrawn. But Roberts has a long history of opposition to the Voting Rights Act and wrote the opinion in the 2013 Supreme Court decision that dismantled part of the law. The February decision by the court is \u201ca troubling sign of what may be to come,\u201d said Michael Li, senior counsel in the Democracy Center for the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. He said there is a real chance the Supreme Court could further gut the Voting Rights Act and \u201cmake it all but impossible to use.\u201d \u201cIf the VRA doesn\u2019t apply in the Black Belt of Alabama, it is hard to see it applying in many places,\u201d Li said. The effects of a decision in favor of Alabama could be widespread, potentially allowing states to dismantle or alter districts that have elected Black, Latino and other minority candidates. Standing by King\u2019s former church in downtown Montgomery, one of the lawsuit\u2019s plaintiffs acknowledges the risk. \u201cI am nervous and I\u2019m not afraid to say that,\u201d said 26-year-old Khadidah Stone. \u201cI think the nervous part is looking at what happened in the summer with Roe v. Wade. When I\u2019m looking at that, I look at what else is up to possibly being attacked.\u201d Even if the plaintiffs prevail, the Alabama Legislature could redraw the lines in a way that actually could jeopardize the one majority Black, Democratic-leaning district. Lowering the percentage of Black voters in Sewell\u2019s district could take an overwhelmingly safe district to one that is less so. Hank Sanders, a Democrat and former longtime state senator who helped draw the congressional map Alabama put in place 20 years ago, said there is a risk that \u201cyou could end up losing both.\u201d But he said the risks have always been there in pursuing civil and voting rights. That is especially true in Alabama and more specifically Montgomery, where memorials to those advances coexist within sight of statues and memorials honoring the Confederacy. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t take risks and we didn\u2019t take a chance, we\u2019d still be in segregation now,\u201d he said. ___ Sherman reported from Washington.

    "Trump: \u2018King\u2019 to some in Pennsylvania, but will it help GOP?": [
        "By LISA MASCAROOctober 2, 2022 GMT",
        " MONONGAHELA, Pa. (AP) \u2014 The Trump-Pence sign still hangs on the older building off Main Street in this historic town, a lasting vestige of the campaign fervor that roused voters, including many who still believe the falsehood that the former president didn\u2019t lose in 2020 and hope he\u2019ll run in 2024. The enthusiasm for Donald Trump\u2019s unique brand of nationalist populism has cut into traditional Democratic strongholds like Monongahela, about 25 miles south of Pittsburgh, where brick storefronts and a Slovak fellowship hall dot Main Street and church bells mark the hours of the day. Republicans are counting on political nostalgia for the Trump era as they battle Democratsthis fall in Pennsylvania in races for governor, the U.S. Senate and control of Congress. \u201cTrump just came along and filled the empty space,\u201d said Matti Gruzs, who stitches old blue jeans into tote bags, place mats and other creations she sells at the weekly Farmer\u2019s Market downtown. \u201cHe\u2019s still the king, and the kingmaker.\u201d Against the backdrop of this picturesque place, House Republicans recently released their campaign agenda, hoping their\u201cCommitment to America\u201dcan tap into the same political sentiment Trump used to attract not just Republican but independent and former Democratic voters. But it\u2019s unclear whether the support that propelled Trump to the White House will be there on Election Day, Nov. 8. Perhaps even more challenging for the GOP is whetherTrump\u2019s false claims of voter fraudwill cost the party if people believe, as the defeated president claims without evidence, the elections are rigged. Some may just decide to sit out the election. \u201cIt started out as a low-enthusiasm race,\u201d said Dave Ball, the Republican Party chairman in Washington County, which includes much of western Pennsylvania. Ball said enthusiasm has been \u201cbuilding rapidly\u201d \u2014 his main metric for voter interest in the elections is the demand for lawn signs. \u201cWe were wondering, at one point, you know, we were going to see any,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, I can\u2019t get my hands on enough.\u201d But Amy Michalic, who was born and raised in Monongahela and works the polls during elections, said she hears skepticism from some voters, particularly Trump supporters, \u201cwho think my vote doesn\u2019t count.\u201d Trump\u2019s claims of fraud have no basis in fact. Dozens of court cases filed by Trump and his supporters have been dismissed or rejected by judges across the nation, but he continues to challengeJoe Biden\u2019s victory. In every state, officials have attested to the accuracy of their elections, and Trump\u2019s own attorney general at the time, Bill Barr, said in 2020there was no voter fraud on a scale to change the outcome. Michalic reminds skeptical voters in her hometown of the importance of voting and notes that in 2016, no one thought Trump could win. \u201cLook what he did, he took Pennsylvania,\u201d she said. At the Farmer\u2019s Market on a recent afternoon, voters shared concerns that many people in the United States voice this election year \u2014 aboutthe high prices of everything, about finding workers and good-paying jobs, about the culture wars. \u201cWhere do you start?\u201d said Michelle DeHosse, wearing an American flag shirt as she helped vendors set up stands. DeHosse, who runs a custom-screen print and embroidery shop on Main Street, said she has had trouble hiring employees since the pandemic. While she said just cannot afford the $20 an hour and health care benefits many applicants demand, she understands that many workers need both. \u201cIt\u2019s the economy that\u2019s the biggest concern,\u201d she said. Democrats were sparse among the voters, who didn\u2019t seem to have strong feelings for their choices this fall for either of theSenate candidates, Democrat John Fetterman or the Trump-backed Republican Mehmet Oz. Several said they probably would vote party line. \u201cI don\u2019t like either one of them,\u201d said Carolyn McCuen, 84, a Republican enjoying sunset with friends and McDonald\u2019s coffee at a picnic table by the river. \u201cMe either,\u201d said another Republican, Sam Reo, 76, a retired mechanical engineer, playing oldies from the portable speaker he sets up for the group. Both still plan to vote. Support for the GOP candidate for governor, Doug Mastriano,who was outside the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021,can be seen in the giant signs along Lincoln Highway, an east-west route across the state. Mastriano is a \u201cfolk hero around here,\u201d said Gruzs, who recalled his regular updates broadcast during the pandemic. A history buff who home-schooled her children, Gruzs hasn\u2019t missed a vote since she cast her first presidential ballot for Ronald Reagan. The same goes for her husband, Sam, a plumber. They moved here two decades ago from Baltimore, for a better life. Now a grandmother, she spends her days working on her crafts and listening to far-right broadcasts \u2013 Steve Bannon, Charlie Kirk and others. She is not a fan ofHouse Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. and isn\u2019t convinced he has the toughness needed to push the party\u2019s ideas forward. But she did attend the event at a nearby manufacturing facility where lawmakers outlined the GOP agenda. She was heartened to see far-right Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene at the event with McCarthy, and made sure to shake Greene\u2019s hand. \u201cIf she\u2019s behind him,\u201d she said, trailing off. \u201cIt looked today he had enough behind him, pushing him.\u201d Trump remains popular, and the sign hanging on the building off Main Street from his 2020 campaign was far from the only one still visible in the state, two years since that election. Several of the voters dismissed theinvestigations against Trumpas nothing more than a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d designed to keep him from running again office, despite the potentially serious charges being raised in state and federal inquiries. Some voters said they didn\u2019t believe theattack on the Capitolwas an insurrection, despite the violence waged by pro-Trump supporters trying to overturn Biden\u2019s election. Those views stand in contrast to the hard facts of Jan. 6: More than 850 people have been arrested and charged in the insurrection, some given lengthy sentences by the courts for their involvement. Hours before the siege, Trump told a rally crowd to \u201cfight like hell\u201d for his presidency. Loyalists soon broke into the Capitol, fighting in hand-to-hand combat with police, interrupting Congress as it was certifying the election results. Five people, including a Trump supporter shot by police, died in the immediate aftermath. And if Trump runs again? \u201cI wish he would,\u201d said McCuen, a retired church secretary. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if he will.\u201d \u2014- Follow AP for full coverage of the midterms at https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections and on Twitter, https://twitter.com/ap_politics",

    "Biden pledge to make federal fleet electric faces slow start": [
        "By HOPE YEN, MATTHEW DALY and DAVID SHARPOctober 2, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden, a self-described \u201ccar guy,\u2033 often promises to lead by example on climate change by moving swiftly to convert the sprawling U.S. government fleet to zero-emission electric vehicles. But efforts to eliminate gas-powered vehicles from the fleet have lagged. Biden last yeardirected the U.S. government to purchase only American-made, zero-emission passenger cars by 2027and electric versions of other vehicles by 2035. \u201cWe\u2019re going to harness the purchasing power of the federal government to buy clean, zero-emission vehicles,\u201d the president said soon after his January 2021 inauguration. He has since used photo ops \u2014taking a spin in Ford Motor Co.\u2019s electric F-150 pickup truck, ordriving GM\u2019s Cadillac Lyriq electric SUV at the Detroit auto show\u2014 to promote their potential.Cabinet officials have hawked a first set of Ford Mustang Mach-E SUVsin use at the departments of Energy and Transportation. The White House frequently describes the 2027 timeline as on track. But the General Services Administration, the agency that purchases two-thirds of the 656,000-vehicle federal fleet, says there are no guarantees. Then there is the U.S. Postal Service, which owns the remaining one-third of the federal fleet. After initially balking and facing lawsuits, the agency now says thathalf of its initial purchase of 50,000 next-generation vehicleswill be powered by electricity. The first set of postal vehicles will hit delivery routes late next year. Climate advocates say that agency can do even better. \u201cUSPS should now go all-electric or virtually all electric with its new vehicles,\u2033 said Luke Tonachel, senior director of clean vehicles and buildings at the Natural Resources Defense Council, citing an additional $3 billion in federal spending targeted for the postal fleet underthe landmark climate law Biden signed last month. About 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions come from the transportation sector, making it the single largest source of planet-warming emissions in the country. Electrification of the federal fleet is a \u201ccornerstone\u201d of Biden\u2019s efforts to decarbonize the federal government, said Andrew Mayock, chief federal sustainability officer for the White House. \u201cThe future is electric, and the federal government has built a strong foundation ... that\u2019s going to deliver on this journey we\u2019re on over the next decade,\u2033 he said in an interview. Excluding the Postal Service, about 13% of new light-duty vehicles purchased across the government this year, or about 3,550, were \u201czero emissions,\u201d according to administration figures provided to The Associated Press. The government defines zero emissions as either electric or plug-in hybrid, which technically has a gas-burning engine. That compares with just under 2% in the 2021 budget year and less than 1% in 2020. Nationwide, about 6% of new car sales are electric. When it comes to vehicles actually on the road, the federal numbers are even smaller. Many of the purchases in recent months won\u2019t be delivered for as long as a year due to supply chain problems. Currently just 1,799 of the 656,000-vehicle federal fleet are zero-emissions vehicles. At a rate of 35,000 to 50,000 GSA car purchases a year, it will take years, if not decades, to convert the entire fleet. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been exactly a fast start,\u201d said Sam Abuelsamid, principal mobility analyst for Guidehouse Insight. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be challenging for them probably for at least the next year or two to really accelerate that pace.\u201d Christina S. Kingsland, who directs the business management division for the federal fleet at GSA, said \u201cthe federal fleet is a working fleet.\u201d The agency pointed to a limited EV supply from automakers with big upfront costs. In addition, it said the needs of agencies are often highly specialized, from Interior Department pickup trucks on large rural tribal reservations to hulking Department of Homeland Security SUVs along the U.S. border. Agencies also need easy access to public EV charging stations. The White House has acknowledged agencies are \u201cway behind\u201d on their own charging infrastructure, with roughly 600 charging stations and 2,000 total chargers nationwide. WhileBiden\u2019s bipartisan infrastructure lawprovides $7.5 billion to statesto build out an EV charging network of up to 500,000 chargersover several years along interstate highways, no money from that law was earmarked for federal agencies\u2019 specialized needs. Money for charging stations must be allocated in each department\u2019s budget. Meeting Biden\u2019s goal for the federal fleet is contingent on industry increasing production as predicted beginning in 2025 and 2026, analysts say. By that time, the effects of big federal investments to build public chargers and boost EV manufacturing in the U.S. will likely be felt alongside tougher rules for automakers to curtail tailpipe emissions. GM, for example, has set a target of 1 million EV annual production capacity worldwide by 2025, while Ford expects to make 2 million EVs globally by 2026. Stellantis also is cranking up production capacity and is getting ready to launch a whole slate of new EVs. The White House has declined to set a specific goal for EV purchases in 2023, but Mayock said he expects the number to be higher than 13%. While the Postal Service is an independent agency, it plays an essential role in fleet electrification, not only because it owns 234,000 vehicles in the federal fleet, but also because the familiar blue-and-white mail trucks are by far the most visible federal vehicle, rolling into neighborhoods across America each day. The agency plans to buy up to 165,000 of next-generation vehicles over a decade. The Postal Service remains \u201ccommitted to reducing our carbon footprint in many areas of our operations and expanding the use of EVs in our fleet is a priority,\u2033 said spokesperson Kim Frum. White House officials say government EV purchases can only increase exponentially after a near-zero baseline a few years ago under President Donald Trump, who sought to loosen fuel economy requirements for gas-powered vehicles and proposed doing away with a federal tax credit for electric cars. At a recent EV demonstration at a Federal Law Enforcement Training Center outside Washington, officers test-drove EVs outfitted for police use, including the Ford Mustang Mach-E. Officers were impressed with the EV\u2019s acceleration and \u201cnimbleness,\u2033 Mayock said, calling the test drives \u201ca big change-management moment\u2033 for the government. ___ Sharp reported from Portland, Maine.

    "Election officials brace for confrontational poll watchers": [
        "By HANNAH SCHOENBAUM and NICHOLAS RICCARDIOctober 2, 2022 GMT",
        " GOLDSBORO, N.C. (AP) \u2014 The situation with the poll watcher had gotten so bad that Anne Risku, the election director in North Carolina\u2019s Wayne County, had to intervene via speakerphone. \u201cYou need to back off!\u201d Risku recalled hollering after the woman wedged herself between a voter and the machine where the voter was trying to cast his ballot at a precinct about 60 miles southeast of Raleigh. The man eventually was able to vote, but the incident was one of several Risku cited from the May primary that made her worry about a wave of newly aggressive poll watchers. Many have spent the past two yearssteeped in liesabout the accuracy of the 2020 election. Those fears led the North Carolina State Board of Elections in August totighten rules governing poll watchers. But the state\u2019s rules review board, appointed by the Republican-controlled Legislature,blocked the new poll watcher regulationsin late September, leaving election officials such as Risku without additional tools to control behavior on Election Day, Nov. 8. \u201cIt becomes complete babysitting,\u201d Risku said in an interview. \u201cThe back and forth for the precinct officials, having somebody constantly on you for every little thing that you do \u2014 not because you\u2019re doing it wrong, but because they don\u2019t agree with what you\u2019re doing.\u201d Poll watchers have traditionally been an essential element of electoral transparency, the eyes and ears for the two major political parties who help ensure that the actual mechanics of voting are administered fairly and accurately. But election officials fear that a surge of conspiracy believers are signing up for those positions this year and are being trained by others who have propagatedthe lie spread by former President Donald Trumpand his allies that the 2020 presidential election wasriddled with fraud. In Michigan, groups that havespread falsehoodsabout that race are recruiting poll watchers. In Nevada, the Republican Party\u2019snominee for secretary of state, Jim Marchant, denies President Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 victory and was a featured speaker at a party poll watcher training. Cleta Mitchell, a prominent conservative lawyer and North Carolina resident, is running a group recruiting poll watchers and workers in eight swing states. Mitchell was on the phone with Trump when the then-president called Georgia\u2019s secretary of state in January 2021 and asked that official to \u201cfind\u201d enough votes for Trump to be declared the state\u2019s winner. Chris Harvey, who was Georgia\u2019s election director in 2020 when Trump claimed the election was being stolen from him, recalled how swarms of Trump backers came as self-appointed poll watchers to observe the state\u2019s manual recounts, harassing election workers and disrupting the process. Harvey fears a repeat this year. \u201cThe whole tension that we\u2019re expecting to see at polling places is something we\u2019re talking to election officials about, something we\u2019re talking to law enforcement about,\u201d said Harvey, who is advising a group of election officials and law enforcement before November. The laws governing poll watchers vary from state to state. Their role is generally to observe, question any deviations from required procedure and, in some states, lodge formal complaints or provide testimony for objections filed in court. The worries this year are similar to those during the 2020 election, when Trump began railing against mail voting and the Republican National Committee launched its first national operation in decades. It had recently been freed from a consent decree that limited its poll watching operation after it previously was found to have targeted Black and Latino voters. But voting went smoothly that November. Mitchell said her organization, the Election Integrity Network, is just trying to ensure that everyone follows the law. \u201cWe are not a threat,\u201d she told The Associated Press during a text message exchange. \u201cUnless you think elections that are conducted according to the rule of law are a threat. We train people to follow the law.\u201d Risku said there were issues with poll watchers from both parties during the primary in May. But of the 13 incidents she reported to the North Carolina board from Wayne County, all involved Republicans. In addition to the poll watcher who had to be ejected, Risku said another Republican poll watcher in her district waited after hours in the parking lot of the Mount Olive Train Depot early voting site until Chief Judge Susan Wiley began carrying boxes of marked ballots to her car. On two occasions, the man tried to follow her back to the elections office in Goldsboro, about a 20-minute drive. Recognizing that the job has become \u201ca scary ordeal\u201d in the last year, Risku said she has stepped up security before November and offered raises to entice precinct officials to stay. She expects many won\u2019t return after this year. The North Carolina GOP chairman, Michael Whatley, said that\u2019s not what the party is teaching its poll watchers. \u201cWhat we saw in terms of some of the activities that were at play may have been coming from Republicans but were not things that we have been teaching people in our training sessions,\u201d Whatley said. \u201cWhat we want to do is make sure that we have people that are in the room that are going to be very respectful of the election officials at all times, be very respectful of the voters at all times and, if they see issues, then report them in.\u201d He has declined to allow reporters to attend the training sessions, which he said have trained 7,000 potential poll watchers so far this year. As in many states, poll watchers are only permitted in North Carolina if they have been designated by the major parties. But in Michigan, organizations that register with local election offices also can provide poll watchers. A coalition of groups that have questioned the 2020 election are scrambling to get as many of their members in place as possible in the politically critical state. \u201cThe best I can do is put a whole bunch of eyeballs on it to make sure that anything that doesn\u2019t look right gets a further look,\u201d said Sandy Kiesel, executive director of the Michigan Election Integrity Fund and Force, part of a coalition that recruited 5,000 poll watchers for the state\u2019s August primary. Kiesel said several of her coalition\u2019s poll watchers and poll challengers \u2014 Michigan law allows one person to observe and another person to formally lodge challenges at precincts \u2014 were prevented from observing or escorted out of polling places in August. Michigan election officials are bracing for more confrontations in November. Patrick Colbeck, a former Republican state senator and prominent election conspiracy theorist who is part of Kiesel\u2019s coalition, announced this past week that a comprehensive fall push to scrutinize every aspect of voting would be called \u201cOperation Overwatch.\u201d \u201cThey are talking about intimidating people who have the right to vote,\u201d said Barb Byrum, clerk of Michigan\u2019s Ingham County, which includes Lansing, the state capital. In a sign of the importance the state\u2019s Republicans place on poll watchers, theGOP-controlled Legislaturelast week agreed to let election offices throughout Michigan start processing mailed ballots two days before Election Day \u2014 somethingmost states with mail voting allowlong before then \u2014 but only if they allow poll watchers to observe. The ballots are not actually counted until Election Day. In Texas, a new law allows every candidate to assign up to two poll watchers, raising the potential that observers could pack polling locations, particularly around big cities such as Dallas and Houston where ballots are the longest. According to records from the secretary of state\u2019s office, more than 900 people in Texas already had received poll watching certification in the three weeks after the state opened required training on Sept. 1. ___ Riccardi reported from Denver.

    "Allies aim for risky Russian oil price cap as winter nears": [
        "By FATIMA HUSSEINOctober 2, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 U.S. officialscelebrated in early Septemberwhen top allies agreed to back an audacious, never-before-tried plan to clamp down on Vladimir Putin\u2019s access to cash as he wages war on Ukraine. The idea sounded simple enough: The countries would pay only cut-rate prices for Russian oil. That woulddeprive Putinof money to keep prosecuting his war in Ukraine, but also ensure that oil continued to flow out of Russia and helped to keep global prices low. A month later, the Group of Seven, representing some of the world\u2019s leading economies, is still figuring out how to execute the plan \u2014 a farmore complex taskthan it might seem at first blush \u2014 and the Dec. 5 deadline to marshal participants is fast approaching. In the meantime, the war grinds on. The Kremlin ismobilizing 300,000more troops to join the invasion of Ukraine andPutin has annexedfour Ukrainian regions after Kremlin-orchestrated referendums that the West denounced as shams. And while the U.S. and European countries have levied thousands of financial and diplomatic sanctions on Russia, includingrecently announced penalties, Treasury leaders say a price cap on oil could deliver the most effective blow to Russia\u2019s economy, undermining its greatest revenue source. Pushed by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, the price cap plan is testing the bounds of statecraft and capitalism. Yellen made her reputation as a Federal Reserve chair who helped steer the U.S. into the longest expansion in its history. Now she\u2019s trying to use global energy markets as a vise to stop a war and keep oil prices from rushing upward this winter. Yellen and her team at Treasury have been lobbying their international counterparts on the price cap since at least May. The U.S. hasalready blocked Russianoil imports, which were small to begin with. \u201cThis is an entirely new way to use financial measures against a global bully,\u201d Elizabeth Rosenberg, Treasury\u2019s head of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes, said at a recentcongressional hearing. \u201cA price cap coalition requires unprecedented coordination with international partners, as well as close partnership with global maritime industries, and exceptional resolve in the face of hostile Russian bluster and threats, including the risk that Russia may seek to retaliate,\u201d Rosenberg said. The risks of this new form of economic warfare are immense to the global oil supply. If it fails or Russia retaliates by stopping the export of oil, then energy prices worldwide could skyrocket. U.S. consumers could feel the ramifications in another spike in gasoline prices. \u201cI don\u2019t have a crystal ball. I don\u2019t know exactly what Russia will do here. There are a lot of different options,\u201d Ben Harris, Treasury\u2019s assistant secretary for economic policy, said during a recent Brookings Institution presentation. He added: \u201cThe price cap provides an opportunity for a bit of a release valve and the hope that these Russian barrels will find the market, but at a reduced price.\u201d The Dec. 5 deadline for setting the price for discounted oil comes just beforea year-end wider European embargoon seaborne Russian crude oil and a complete ban on shipping insurance designed to prevent Russian oil from reaching non-European buyers. The embargo and insurance ban could eliminate up to 4 million barrels a day from the world\u2019s daily supply of petroleum, a loss of roughly 4%. Treasury\u2019s hope is that the price cap kicks in first and allows some of that oil to keep flowing via exceptions to the embargo and the insurance ban, albeit at prices lower than market rates. While Treasury officials and leading economists express confidence that the plan will work \u2014 and already is working \u2014 some oil analysts are wary of trying to implement it before winter, in a global economy already scarred by supply shocks, and a Europe facingfast-rising inflation. The unknowns are too many, they say. \u201cThe wildcard factor to me is what the Russians do, because the Russians have made abundantly clear that they do not want to play along with price caps,\u201d said Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets. \u201cWe should prepare ourselves at least,\u201d she said, \u201cthat they may withhold oil.\u201d Ed Morse, head of commodities research at Citi Group, said at the Brookings Institution recently: \u201cIt\u2019s an experiment that\u2019s never been done in world history. I think it is a poor judgment call to do this at this time.\u201d Oil is the Kremlin\u2019s main pillar of financial revenue and has kept the Russian economy afloat so far in the war despite export bans, sanctions and thefreezing of central bankassets that began with theFebruary invasion. Before the war, Russia exported roughly 5 million barrels of oil per day as one of the world\u2019s biggest oil exporters. That figure \u2014 accounting for roughly 9% of the world\u2019s crude exports \u2014 has largely been unchanged despite all the sanctions. Russia hasvowed to take retaliatory measuresto offset the impact of the price cap. Last week, Kommersant, a Russian business newspaper, reported that the Kremlin is considering raising $50 billion in additional revenue from taxes on exported energy, in response to the plan. Analysts are hopeful the Russians are bluffing. Deutsche Bank recently assigned a \u201clow probability\u201d to Russia stopping its exports and cut its forecast for the price of crude by 10%. The German bank cited the U.S. Treasury\u2019s announcement that India could have flexibility to buy from non-EU providers if it doesn\u2019t join the price cap coalition, among other factors. And while it\u2019s assumed China and India won\u2019t be part of an official coalition on the price cap, lower prices paid to Russia by these nations would help accomplish the coalition\u2019s goal, Treasury officials say, getting more oil on the market with less revenue for the Kremlin. Already, Russia is locking in long-term contracts to limit the loss of potential oil revenues. Raoul LeBlanc, vice president of energy at S&P Global Commodity Insights, said in some ways the discounts Russia is already providing countries show that a price cap could work. LeBlanc said the complete loss of Russian oil on the global marketplace \u201cwould be catastrophic to the world economy\u201d and losses would most heavily affect Latin America and much of South Asia. Many European countries are already seeing major impacts of the war on their economies without a price cap in effect. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development last week said the global economy isset to lose $2.8 trillionin output in 2023 because of the war. On other energy matters, European Union energy ministers on Fridaylevied a taxon fossil fuel companies\u2019 windfall profits, but could not agree on a natural gas price cap. Treasury is navigating a host of tricky questions as it works to implement the oil price cap plan. Among them: figuring out the size of the discount the G-7 and others would force on Russian oil, how the price cap would interact with the coming embargo and insurance ban, how companies would conduct their business as they try to avoid sanctions and how to stop Putin from getting around any cap. Ben Cahill, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said he believes the price cap is \u201cbetter than the status quo\u201d \u2014 the expected European embargo on oil and ban on maritime insurance. But, Cahill adds, it will create complexities in the market that could drive up the cost of doing business. \u201cIt\u2019s a big gamble,\u201d he said.",

    "UN says detained Iranian-American was allowed to leave Iran": [
        "October 2, 2022 GMT",
        " UNITED NATIONS (AP) \u2014 An 85-year-old Iranian-American who formerly worked for the U.N. children\u2019s agency and was detained in Iran in 2016 has been permitted to leave the country for medical treatment abroad, the United Nations said Saturday. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric announced the departure of Baquer Namazi and said Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was grateful he could leave following the U.N. chief\u2019s appeals to Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi. Dujarric said the secretary-general was also pleased that Namazi\u2019s son, Siamak Namazi, had been released from detention. An international human rights lawyer handling their case, Jared Genser, tweeted Saturday: \u201cI am delighted to confirm for the first time in seven years that Siamak #Namazi is spending a night at home with his parents in Tehran. Baquer Namazi\u2019s travel ban has been lifted. We won\u2019t rest until they return to the U.S. & their long nightmare has ended.\u201d Namazi, a former UNICEF representative, was detained in 2016 when he traveled to Tehran to see his son, a businessman arrested in Iran months earlier. Both Namazis were sentenced to 10 years in prison in Iran on what the United States and United Nations say were trumped-up spying charges. Baquer Namazi was granted medical furlough in 2018 and his sentence was subsequently commuted to time served, but Iranian authorities had not permitted him to leave the country. Last October, he underwent surgery in Iran to clear a blockage in an artery to the brain that his family and supporters described as life-threatening. Siamak Namazi had remained jailed in Iran\u2019s notorious Evin prison. Dujarric said the U.N. \u201cwill continue to engage with the Iranian authorities on a range of important issues, including the regional situation, sustainable development and the promotion and protection of human rights.\u201d The State Department said it was gratified to learn of Iran\u2019s actions but added that \u201cour efforts are far from over.\u201d \u201cWe remain committed and determined to securing the freedom of all Americans unjustly detained in Iran and elsewhere. They should be reunited with their loved ones as soon as possible,\u201d State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement.",

The swap of the Americans,including five oil executives held for nearly five years, follows months of back channel diplomacy by senior U.S. officials \u2014 secretive talks with a major oil producer that took on greater urgency after sanctions on Russia put pressure on global energy prices. The deal amounts to an unusual gesture of goodwill by Maduro as the socialist leader looks to rebuild relations with the U.S. after vanquishing most of his domestic opponents. While the White House denied any change in policy toward Venezuela is afoot, the freeing of Americans could create political space for the Biden administration to ease crippling oil sanctions on Venezuela if Maduro shows progress in on-again, off-again talks with his opponents. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d Cristina Vadell, the daughter of Tomeu Vadell, one of the freed Americans, told The Associated Press on Saturday. Holding back tears of joy on her 31st birthday, she said: \u201cThis is the best birthday present ever. I\u2019m just so happy.\u201d The transfer took place Saturday in the Caribbean island of St. Vincent and Grenadines, which is ruled by an ally of Maduro, three people in Venezuela briefed on the matter told the AP on the condition of anonymity. The prisoners arrived from their respective locations in separate planes, the Biden administration said. \u201cThese individuals will soon be reunited with their families and back in the arms of their loved ones where they belong,\u201d President Joe Biden said in a statement. Those freed include five employees of Houston-based Citgo \u2014 Vadell, Jose Luis Zambrano, Alirio Zambrano, Jorge Toledo and Jose Pereira \u2014 who were lured to Venezuela right before Thanksgiving in 2017 to attend a meeting at the headquarters of the company\u2019s parent, state-run-oil giant PDVSA. Once there, they were hauled away by masked security agents who busted into a Caracas conference room. Themen were convicted of embezzlement in 2020in a trial marred by delays and irregularities and sentenced to between eight years and 13 years in prison for a never-executed proposal to refinance billions in the oil company\u2019s bonds. Also released wasMatthew Heath, a former U.S. Marine corporal from Tennessee who was arrested in 2020 at a roadblock in Venezuela, and a Florida man, Osman Khan, who was arrested in January. The State Department had regarded all the men as wrongfully detained. To facilitate a deal, Biden granted clemency forFranqui Flores and his cousin Efrain Campo, nephews of \u201cFirst Combatant\u201d Cilia Flores, as Maduro calls his wife. The men were arrested in Haiti in a Drug Enforcement Administration sting in 2015 and convicted the following year in New York in a highly charged case that cast a hard look at U.S. accusations of drug trafficking at the highest levels of Maduro\u2019s administration. Referring to the men only as Venezuelans \u201cunjustly imprisoned\u201d in the U.S., the Maduro government in a statement said it \u201cwelcomes the outcome of these talks and hopes for the preservation of peace and harmony with all the nations of our region and the world.\u201d The Biden administration has been under pressure to do more to bring home the roughly 60 Americans it believes are held hostage abroad or wrongfully detained by hostile foreign governments. While much of the focus is on Russia, where the U.S. has so far tried unsuccessfully to secure the release ofWNBA star Brittney Griner and another American, Paul Whelan, Venezuela has been holding the largest contingent of Americans suspected of being used as bargaining chips. At least four other Americans remain detained in Venezuela, including two former Green Berets \u2014 Luke Denman and Airan Berry \u2014 involved in a slapdash attempt to oust Maduro in 2019, and two other men \u2014 Eyvin Hernandez and Jerrel Kenemore \u2014 who, like Khan, were detained for allegedly entering the country illegally from neighboring Colombia. \u201cTo all the families who are still suffering and separated from their loved ones who are wrongfully detained \u2014 know that we remain dedicated to securing their release,\u201d Biden said in his statement. Saturday\u2019s swap came together quietly over several months of backchannel talks. Roger Carstens, the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs,has made multiple visits to Venezuelaover the last year to discuss potential deals and to meet with the detained Americans. In July, Maduro officials upped the ante in meetings in Caracas with Carstens and Ambassador James Story, who heads the Venezuela Affairs Unit in neighboring Colombia. It substitutes for the U.S. Embassy the Trump administration shuttered in 2019 to protest Maduro\u2019s reelection in what was widely seen as a sham election. In exchange for freeing the nephews and insider businessmanAlex Saab, Maduro was willing to release all Americans, a U.S. official briefed on the outreach told the AP. In the end, Saab \u2014 Venezuela considers him a diplomat and U.S. prosecutors a corrupt regime enabler \u2014 was never seriously considered, according to the U.S. official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss the talks. Unlike the nephews, who were arrested as a result of a drug sting and are about halfway through 18-year sentences, Saab bitterly fought his extradition to the U.S. from Cape Verde, where he was arrested in 2020 during a stopover en route to Iran. He is now awaiting trial in Miami federal court on charges of siphoning off millions in state contracts. Still, it\u2019s unclear if the prisoner release will lead to a broader thaw in relations. The Biden administration is constrained in its engagement with Maduro, especially in the battleground state of Florida, where Latino voters whose families fled authoritarian rule in Cuba and Venezuela hold major sway. \u201cAnother Biden appeasement that will result in more anti-U.S. dictators taking more innocent Americans hostage in the future,\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said on Twitter about Saturday\u2019s exchange. Although the U.S. in the last six months has struck similar deals with Russia, and more recently with the Taliban, a senior Biden administration official downplayed any suggestion that it was caving to hostage-takers, saying such exchanges remain \u201cextraordinarily rare.\u201d The official, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the administration, also pointed toan executive order from this summer that sought to impose new costs on countries that jail Americans without cause. Meanwhile, many Maduro supporters remain distrustful of the U.S. \u201cEmpire,\u201d recalling the Trump administration\u2019s decision to impose sanctions on a Venezuelan governor who brokered the release of another American,Joshua Holt, in 2018. However, some longtime Venezuela watchers say they\u2019re hopeful this time will be different. A visit to Caracas in March by Juan Gonzalez, the top National Security Council adviser on Latin America, was itself a remarkable gesture toward a leader whom the U.S. considers illegitimate and has indicted on narco-terrorism charges. The Biden administration has also promised to review sanctions if Maduro can point to progress in talks with opponents that had been taking place in Mexico that are aimed at creating fairer conditions for 2024 presidential elections \u201cPresident Biden did the right thing,\u201d said Caleb McCarry, a former Republican staffer who met recently with Maduro in a bid to free Americans and improve bilateral relations. \u201cThis is serious diplomacy and can only help put the Mexico negotiations back on track. It\u2019s a win for the families, the American people and the Venezuelan people.\u201d ____ Goodman reported from Miami.",

    "Archives: Records from Trump WH staffers remain missing": [
        "By FARNOUSH AMIRIOctober 1, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The National Archives and Records Administration informed lawmakers that a number of electronic communications from Trump White House staffers remain missing, nearly two years since the administration was required to turn them over. The nation\u2019s record-keeping agency, in a letter Friday to the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, said that despite an ongoing effort by staff, electronic communications between certain unidentified White House officials were still not in their custody. \u201cWhile there is no easy way to establish absolute accountability, we do know that we do not have custody of everything we should,\u201d Debra Steidel Wall, the acting U.S. archivist, wrote in a letter to Oversight Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y. The letter went on to specify that the National Archives would consult with the Justice Department about how to move forward and recover \u201cthe records unlawfully removed.\u201d It has been widely reported that officials in President Donald Trump\u2019s White House used non-official electronic messaging accounts throughout his four years in office. The Presidential Records Act, which says that such records are government property and must be preserved, requires staff to copy or forward those messages into their official electronic messaging accounts. The agency says that while it has been able to obtain these records from some former officials, a number remain outstanding. The Justice Department has already pursued records from one former Trump official, Peter Navarro, who prosecutors accused of using at least one \u201cnon-official\u201d email account \u2014 a ProtonMail account \u2014 to send and receive emails while he worked as the president\u2019s trade adviser. The legal action in August came just weeks after Navarro was indicted on criminal charges after refusing to cooperate with a congressional investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The House committee has jurisdiction over the Presidential Records Act, a 1978 law that requires the preservation of White House documents as property of the U.S. government. The request is the latest development in a monthslong back-and-forth between the agency and the committee, which has been investigating Trump\u2019s handling of records. The letter on Friday also comes nearly two months after the FBI recovered more than 100 documents with classified markings and more than 10,000 other government documents from Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate. Lawyers for Trump had provided a sworn certification that all government records had been returned. Maloney and other Democratic lawmakers on the panel have been seeking a briefing from the National Archives, but haven\u2019t received one due to the Justice Department\u2019s ongoing criminal investigation into the matter.",

    "Jimmy Carter celebrating 98 with family, friends, baseball": [
        "By BILL BARROWOctober 1, 2022 GMT",
        " ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Jimmy Carter, alreadythe longest-living U.S. president in history, turned 98 on Saturday, celebrating with family and friends in Plains, the tiny Georgia town where he and his wife, 95-year-old Rosalynn, were born in the years between World War I and the Great Depression. His latest milestone came asThe Carter Center, which the 39th president and the former first lady established after their one White House term, marked 40 years of promoting democracy and conflict resolution, monitoring elections, and advancing public health in the developing world. Jason Carter, the former president\u2019s grandson now leading the Carter Center board, described his grandfather, an outspoken Christian, as content with his life and legacy. \u201cHe is looking at his 98th birthday with faith in God\u2019s plan for him,\u201d the younger Carter, 47, said, \u201cand that\u2019s just a beautiful blessing for all of us to know, personally, that he is at peace and happy with where he has been and where he\u2019s going.\u201d Carter Center leaders said the former president, whosurvived a cancer diagnosis in 2015and aserious fall at home in 2019, was enjoying reading congratulatory messages sent by well-wishers around the world via social media and the center\u2019s website even before the actual birthday. But Jason Carter said his grandfather mostly looked forward to a simple day that included watching his favorite Major League Baseball team, the Atlanta Braves, on television. \u201cHe\u2019s still 100% with it, even though daily life things are a lot harder now,\u201d Jason Carter said. \u201cBut one thing I guarantee. He will watch all the Braves games this weekend.\u201d James Earl Carter Jr. won the 1976 presidential election after beginning the campaign as a little-known, one-term Georgia governor. His surprise performance in the Iowa caucuses established the small, Midwestern state as an epicenter of presidential politics. Carter went on to defeat President Gerald Ford in the general election, largely on the strength of sweeping the South before his native region shifted heavily to Republicans. A Naval Academy alumnus, Navy officer and peanut farmer, Carter won in no small part because of his promise never to lie to an electorate weary over the Vietnam War and theWatergate scandal that resulted in Richard Nixon\u2019s resignation from the presidency in 1974.Four years later, unable to tame inflation andsalve voter anger over American hostages held in Iran, Carter lost 44 states to Ronald Reagan. He returned home to Georgia in 1981 at the age of 56. The former first couple almost immediately began planning The Carter Center. It opened in Atlanta in 1982 as a first-of-its-kind effort for a former president. The stated mission: to advance peace, human rights and public health causes around the world.Carter won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002. He traveled internationally into his 80s and 90s, and he did not retire officially from the board until 2020. Since opening, the center has monitored elections in 113 countries, saidCEO Paige Alexander, and Carter has acted individually as a mediator in many countries, as well. Carter Center effortshave nearly eradicated the guinea worm, a parasite spread through unclean drinking water and painful to humans. Rosalynn Carter has steered programs designed to reduce stigma attached to mental health conditions. \u201cHe\u2019s enjoying his retirement,\u201d said Alexander, who assumed her role in 2020, about the time Jason Carter took over for his grandfather. But \u201che spends a lot of time thinking about the projects that he started and the projects that we\u2019re continuing.\u201d Alexander cited the guinea worm eradication effort as a highlight. Carter set the goal in 1986, when there were about 3.5 million cases annually across 21 countries, with a concentration in sub-Saharan Africa. So far this year, Alexander said, there are six known cases in two countries. In 2019, Carter used his final annual message at the center to lament that his post-presidency had been largely silent on climate change. Jason Carter said the center\u2019s leadership is still exploring ways to combat the climate crisis. But he offered no timetable. \u201cWe won\u2019t duplicate other effective efforts,\u201d Carter said, explaining that one of the center\u2019s strategic principles is to prioritize causes and places that no other advocacy organizations have engaged. On elections and democracy, perhaps the most unpredictable development is that Jimmy Carter has lived to see the center turn its efforts to the home front. Thecenter now has programs to combat mistrust in the democratic process in the United States. Carter Center personnel monitored Georgia\u2019s recount of U.S. presidential ballots in the state in 2020 afterthen-President Donald Trump argued the outcome was rigged. Multiple recounts in Georgia and other states affirmed the legitimacy of Joe Biden\u2019s victory. \u201cCertainly, we never thought we would end up coming home to do democracy and conflict resolution around our elections,\u201d Jason Carter said. \u201c(But) we couldn\u2019t go be this incredible democracy and human rights organization overseas without ensuring that we were adding our voice and our expertise ... in the U.S.\u201d Ahead of the U.S. midterm elections, the center has asked candidates \u2014 regardless of party \u2014 to sign onto a set of fair election principles, including committing to the peaceful transfer of power. Among those who have signed commitments: Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, and his Democratic challenger, Stacey Abrams. Carter himself has mostly retreated from politics. For years after his 1980 defeat, Democrats steered clear of him. He enjoyed a resurgence in recent election cycles, drawing visits from several 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls and, in 2021, from President Joe Biden, who in 1976 was the first U.S. senator to endorse Carter\u2019s presidential bid. With inflation now at its highest levels since the late 1970s and early 1980s, some Republicans are bringing up Carter again as an attack line on Biden and Democrats. Jason Carter said the former president reads and watches the news daily, and sometimes accepts calls or visits from political figures. But, he added, the former president isn\u2019t expected to appear publicly to endorse any candidates ahead of November. \u201cHis people that he feels sort of the closest connection with now are the folks in Plains, at his church and other places,\u201d Jason Carter said. \u201cBut, you know, his partner No. 1, 2 and 3 is my grandma, right? He has outlived friends and so many of his advisers and the people that he accomplished so much with in the past, but they\u2019ve never been lonely because they\u2019ve always had each other.\u201d ___ Online: https://bit.ly/Happy98PresidentCarter ___ Associated Press journalist Alex Sanz contributed to this report.",

    "Cha-ching! Biden embraces his election-year fundraising role": [
        "By SEUNG MIN KIM and AAMER MADHANIOctober 1, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Whenever a donor\u2019s unsilenced cellphone goes off at a fundraiser while President Joe Biden is talking, he has the same joke ready to go: It\u2019s Donald Trump on the other line. \u201cIf that\u2019s Trump calling me again, tell him I\u2019m busy,\u201d Biden said at an event this past week for the Democratic Governors Association, repeating a variation of the quip he also relayed during receptions in Illinois and New York earlier this year. The crowd of a few dozen, as they always do, chuckled as the president continued with the rest of his remarks. It\u2019s one glimpse of Biden as fundraiser in chief \u2014 a man who schmoozes with aplomb while raking in millions at receptions that will be a fixture of his political schedule during the final stretch before Election Day, Nov. 8. At these events, celebrities are spotted and alcohol is consumed, while Biden gets the one-on-one interactions he had missed for much of his campaign and presidency due to COVID-19. The fundraisers \u2014 held in lavish Manhattan apartments, drab conference centers and backyard tents glammed up with chandeliers \u2014 have been one of themost visible ways Biden has been deployedthis election year at a time when hisapproval ratings remain underwaterand manyDemocrats aren\u2019t eager to stand by himon the campaign trail. \u201cJoe Biden is Joe Biden. He\u2019s real, he\u2019s down to earth, if he knows the people in the room \u2026 he\u2019s even more relaxed,\u201d said Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., a close ally. \u201cHe gets all kinds of questions, he answers them honestly, he probably gives his staff heart attacks.\u201d So far this year, Biden has headlined 11 receptions to raise cash directly for the Democratic National Committee, and they have brought in more than $19.6 million, according to the committee. The events have ranged from a $300,000 haul at a yacht club in Portland, Oregon, to acozy, 18-person affair(with four others on video screens) at Hotel Washington near the White House that took in more than $3 million. A pair of fundraisersat mansions in Southern Californiaduring the Summit of the Americas in June raked in $5 million in a matter of hours. Separate from the DNC events, Biden spoke at a fundraiser in September benefiting Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer that brought in more than $450,000 for the state Democratic Party. The governors association event raised $1 million, and Biden was to have appeared on Tuesday at a fundraiser on behalf of Charlie Crist, the nominee for governor in Florida who has not been shy about wanting the president to campaign with him. That political trip was postponed due to Hurricane Ian. The DNC also enlists Biden for solicitations sent to its grassroots donor list, with emails signed by the president consistently raising the most money for the committee, party officials say. As of this past week, the DNC has raised more than $107 million, the most at this point in any year and an amount that Democratic officials credited in large part to Biden\u2019s direct involvement. Biden seems to particularly relish the in-person interactions that a private fundraiser offers. A famously chummy politician, Biden makes sure at any big-dollar event that his hosts are made to feel special and recognized. For instance, at a late August fundraiser in the Washington suburbs, Biden first spent some time giving a child near the front of the gathering a bit of attention and then the president gave his remarks for several dozen big-dollar DNC supporters. \u201cHoney, what\u2019s your name?\u201d Biden asked a little girl, sitting through what he joked had to be the most \u201cboring\u201d event. \u201cWell, let me tell you something. Is that your daddy? He owes you big for having to sit here.\u201d At a June fundraiser in Beverly Hills, California, at the home of billionaire media mogul Haim Saban, the president mused to Saban\u2019s wife, Cheryl, that both men had \u201cmarried way above our station.\u201d And standing in the 65th-floor apartment of Henry and Marsha Laufer overlooking New York\u2019s Central Park, Biden gushed over the \u201cmagnificent\u201d view, noting: \u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a better view in New York than here.\u201d Indeed, the residence is a \u201cpiece of heaven\u201d for the Laufers, who appeared fastidious about keeping their place spotless. Attendees checked their shoes \u2013 expensive Jimmy Choo mules and Saint Laurent pumps among them \u2014 at the door and listened to Biden while in socks or slippers provided by the couple. A small group of reporters in attendance were asked to place \u201cbooties\u201d over their shoes to protect their hardwood floors and light-colored carpets. (None of the shoe rules applied to Biden, who kept his on and did not wear the disposable coverings.) At Biden fundraisers, celebrities such as the actor Robert De Niro (in New York) or filmmaker Ken Burns (in Boston) make the occasional cameo, although neither stayed long enough to hear the president speak. To donors, Biden\u2019s comments, which can run from a few minutes to a half-hour, are a much more casual,off-the-cuff version of the campaign speechthat he delivers in front of the cameras. Journalists have access to Biden fundraisers, although just with a notepad and pen, meaning cameras are barred. Especially as of late, Biden takes care to underline his administration\u2019s accomplishments \u2014 a $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package, a bipartisan infrastructure law, a climate and health care bill that came after months of internal Democratic wrangling. He then stresses to donors how theupcoming November midterms are a choice, not just between keeping his achievements and Republicans unraveling them, but on other issues such as abortion and guns. While aides dispute that his message varies in more private settings, Biden frequently speaks extemporaneously and can be far less guarded than at his formal remarks at a lectern or on a stage. It\u2019s been at fundraisers where Biden has invoked variations of fascism \u2013be it \u201csemi-fascism\u201d or \u201ctint of fascism\u201d-- to refer to Trump-fueled forces within the Republican Party that Biden has said are a threat to the nation\u2019s democratic foundations. While his spokeswoman declined to assess the implications ofthe recent election in Italy, where a political party with neo-fascist roots won the most votes, Biden at the DGA fundraiser pointed to the results as he warned about the fate of democracy both in the United States and abroad. At the Laufers\u2019 home, Biden \u2013 who tends to avoid talking about his faith when discussing policy \u2014 notably referenced the Catholic Church\u2019s position while castigating Republicans who had pushed for broad bans on abortion. \u201cI happen to be a practicing Roman Catholic. My church doesn\u2019t even make that argument,\u201d he said, referring to abortion bans that leave \u201cno exceptions.\u201d The quintessential Biden qualities \u2014 his candor and his warmth with the crowd \u2014 become more pronounced once the press is kicked out and audience members have a chance to ask Biden questions, say people who have attended such gatherings. The questions Biden gets vary from event to event and they veer from political strategy to the news of the day. During a Manhattan fundraiser at the home of businessman and social justice activist Henry Munoz, Biden was pressed on his plans on immigration and how he would describe his closing message to voters, as well as the impact of the overturning of Roe v. Wade, according to a person who spoke on condition of anonymity to relay details of a private event. The bulk of Biden\u2019s fundraising activity has been for the DNC, and Biden earlier this year greenlighted a $15 million transfer from it to the party\u2019s House and Senate campaign committees, a sign of his personal investment in trying to ensure Democrats retain their majorities this fall. A White House official said Biden receives \u201cquite a few\u201d requests from Democratic candidates to appear at fundraisers, and aides work to accommodate as many as possible depending on his schedule and other factors. Whitmer took priority because she was a co-chair of both Biden\u2019s presidential campaign and his inauguration. ___ Follow AP for full coverage of the midterms at https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections and on Twitter, https://twitter.com/ap_politics",

    "GOP attacks Georgia\u2019s Abrams on voting as judge rejects suit": [
        "By JEFF AMYOctober 1, 2022 GMT",
        " ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 When Democrat Stacey Abrams narrowly lost the Georgia governor\u2019s race to Republican Brian Kemp four years ago, she didn\u2019t go quietly. She ended her campaign with a nonconcessionthat acknowledged she wouldn\u2019t be governor, while spotlighting her claims that Kemp had used his post as secretary of state to improperly purge likely Democratic voters. Abrams founded Fair Fight Action, a group focused on fair elections, which within weeks filed a wide-ranging federal lawsuit alleging \u201cgross mismanagement\u201d of Georgia\u2019s elections. That lawsuit sputtered out Fridaywith Fair Fight losing its last remaining arguments, more than a yearafter the judge had tossed most earlier claims. People are already voting by mail in a Georgia governor\u2019s race that again pits Abrams and Kemp against each other, with fewer than 40 days remaining before voting ends on Nov. 8. And Republicans are now using the loss to attack what they see as the \u201cbig lie\u201d that underlies Abrams\u2019 career. They label her claims that Georgia\u2019s election system has been discriminatory as a fraud she used to enrich herself and aggrandize her political career after her 2018 loss. \u201cThis is existential to who Stacey Abrams has become as a public and political figure,\u201d Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, a Republican who defended the case, told The Associated Press on Saturday. \u201cShe put herself in the political spotlight nationally, potentially globally, all over the narrative that she lost the governor\u2019s race because of voter suppression. And here you have a federal judge saying, it\u2019s all untrue. It didn\u2019t happen.\u201d Carr and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger are among a faction of Georgia Republicans who say that Democratic President Joe Biden beat Donald Trump fair and square in 2020 for Georgia\u2019s 16 electoral votes and that Kemp also beat Abrams fairly in 2018. They argue that Trump\u2019s claims about voter fraud in 2020 and Abrams\u2019 claims about voter suppression in 2018 both corrode faith in democracy. \u201cStolen election and voter suppression claims by Stacey Abrams were nothing but poll-tested rhetoric not supported by facts and evidence,\u201d Raffensperger said Friday in a statement. Abrams, though, has said from the dawn of her current campaign that her actions in 2018 are not equivalent to what Trump did. \u201cI will never ever say that it is OK to claim fraudulent outcomes as a way to give yourself power,\u201d Abrams told news outlet The 19th last month. \u201cThat is wrong. I reject it and will never engage in it. But I do believe that it is imperative, especially those who have the platform and the microphone, to talk about the access.\u201d She is far from backing down from her position, and says she won a number of victories that made elections fairer. In 2019, less than six months after the Fair Fight lawsuit was filed, legislators passed a law that addressed some of the issues. The law\u2019s biggest change was to replace the state\u2019s antiquated, paperless touchscreen voting machines with a new system that uses touchscreen machines to print paper ballots that are scanned. The plaintiffs also count as wins the reinstatement of 22,000 voters who were removed from the rolls in 2019, an end to people being excluded from voting rolls if their records didn\u2019t exactly match their driver\u2019s license, an audit that identified people wrongly excluded because of incorrect citizenship information, and improvements to a voter\u2019s ability to cancel a mailed ballot and vote in person. \u201cAs the judge says in his first sentence, \u2018This is a voting rights case that resulted in wins and losses for all parties,\u2019\u201d Abrams said in a Friday statement. \u201cHowever, the battle for voter empowerment over voter suppression persists, and the cause of voter access endures. I will not stop fighting to ensure every vote can be cast, every ballot is counted and every voice is heard.\u201d And despite the loss, the idea that Republicans are trying to restrict voting is a powerful current running through the most bitter disputes in Georgia politics \u2014 not only Abrams\u2019 2018 loss, but also a2021 Republican election lawthat shortened the period to request an absentee ballot and limited ballot drop boxes, andharsh clashes over redrawing election districts this yearthat led one Democrat to accuse Republicans of seeking to preserve \u201cwhite power.\u201d Jermaine House, director of communications for political research firm HIT Strategies, said that \u201cbecause there\u2019s been so much energy and excitement and conversation\u201d around voting rights in Georgia, it\u2019s an issue that drives Democrats, especially African Americans, to the polls. His firm has done work for liberal voter mobilization group New Georgia Project, the NAACP and Democratic efforts to reelect Sen. Raphael Warnock. \u201cIf you look at polls across the country about voter suppression, you may find that voter suppression may not reach the top 10 issues among Black voters,\u201d House said. \u201cBut one exception that is the case is definitely Georgia. Georgia voters are well aware of voter suppression efforts, very attuned to it, and Black voters are really mobilized by the issue.\u201d ___ Follow Jeff Amy on Twitter athttp://twitter.com/jeffamy.",

    "Trump at center of Oath Keepers novel defense in Jan. 6 case": [
        "By ALANNA DURKIN RICHER and LINDSAY WHITEHURSTOctober 1, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The defense team in theCapitol riottrial of theOath Keepers leaderis relying on an unusual strategy with Donald Trump at the center. Lawyers for Stewart Rhodes, founder of theextremist group, are poised to argue thatjurorscannot find him guilty of seditious conspiracy because all the actions he took before the siege on Jan. 6, 2021, were in preparation for orders he anticipated from the then-president \u2014 orders that never came. Rhodes and four associates are accused of plotting for weeks to stop the transfer of presidential power from the Republican incumbent to Democrat Joe Biden, culminating with Oath Keepers in battle gear storming the Capitol alongside hundreds of other Trump supporters. Opening statements in the trial are set to begin Monday. Rhodes intends to take the stand to argue he believed Trump was going to invoke the Insurrection Act to call up a militia to support him, his lawyers have said. Trump didn\u2019t do that, but Rhodes\u2019 team says that what prosecutors allege was an illegal conspiracy was \u201cactually lobbying and preparation for the President to utilize\u201d the law. It\u2019s a novel legal argument in a trial that\u2019s one of the most serious cases coming out of the Capitol attack. \u201cThis is an incredibly complicated defense of theory and I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s ever played out in this fashion in American jurisprudence,\u201d one of Rhodes\u2019 lawyers, James Lee Bright, told The Associated Press. The Insurrection Act gives a president broad authority to call up the military and decide what shape that force will take.Trump did float that kind of action at other points in his presidency. To succeed with this line of defense, Bright would have to convince a jury that Rhodes was waiting on the go-ahead from the president, which could be a major hurdle. Rhodes\u2019 lawyers have argued Trump could have called up a militia in response to \u201cwhat he perceived as a conspiracy to deprive a class of persons in several states of their voting rights.\u201d Rhodes published an open letter on the Oath Keepers\u2019 website in December 2020 urging Trump to use the Insurrection Act to \u201c\u2018stop the steal\u2019 and defeat the coup.\u201d If Rhodes testifies, he could face intense questioning from prosecutors, who say his own words show the Oath Keepers would act no matter what Trump did. Bright said Rhodes, a Yale Law School graduate, understands the risks of testifying but has insisted since the first day they met that he be able to \u201cspeak his piece.\u201d Rhodes and his associates \u2014 Kelly Meggs, Thomas Caldwell, Jessica Watkins and Kenneth Harrelson \u2014 are the first Jan. 6 defendants to be tried on seditious conspiracy, a rarely used Civil War-era charge that can be difficult to prove. The defense would have to convince the jury that the Oath Keepers really intended to defend the government, not use force against it, said David Alan Sklansky, a former federal prosecutor who\u2019s now a professor at Stanford Law School. \u201cIf you think you are plotting to help protect the government, there is an argument that that means you don\u2019t have the required guilty mindset that\u2019s necessary in order to be guilty of seditious conspiracy,\u201d he said. Court records show the Oath Keepers repeatedly warning of the prospect of violence if Biden were to become president. The Oath Keepers amassed weapons and stationed armed \u201cquick reaction force\u201d teams at a Virginia hotel in case they were needed, prosecutors say. Among those likely to testify against Rhodes are three of his former followers, including one who has said Rhodes instructed them to be ready to use lethal force if necessary to keep Trump in the White House. Defense lawyers say the quick reaction force teams were defensive forces only to be used if Trump invoked the Insurrection Act. If Rhodes really wanted to lead a revolution, his lawyers say there was no better opportunity to deploy the quick reaction force than when hundreds of people were storming the Capitol. But the Oath Keepers never did. \u201cThe conditions would never be better. Yet, Rhodes and the others left the Capitol grounds and went to Olive Garden for dinner,\u201d they\u2019ve written in court papers. Rhodes never went into the Capitol and has said that the Oath Keepers who did acted on their own. The Insurrection Act is shorthand for a series of statutes that Congress passed between 1792 and 1871 defining when military force can be used in the United States by the federal government, said University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck. The Act does give the president wide discretion to decide when military force is necessary, and what qualifies as military force, Vladeck said. The last time the Insurrection Act was used was in May of 1992, by President George H.W. Bush to call out the military to respond to Los Angeles riots after the acquittal of white police officers accused in the beating of Black motorist Rodney King. Even if Trump had acted, prosecutors would still have a strong case that the Oath Keepers tried to keep Congress from carrying out its responsibilities as part of the transfer of presidential power, Vladeck said. Even if the president could authorize their actions, the Oath Keepers could still have been \u2014 as the law puts it \u2014 forcibly opposing other elements of the government, he said. \u201cThe government of the United States is more than just the president,\u201d Vladeck said. Michael Weinstein, a former Justice Department prosecutor, agreed that Rhodes\u2019 argument is not likely to win over a jury. But that may not be his only goal. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a little bit of a show trial for him,\u201d said Weinstein, now a criminal defense lawyer in New Jersey. \u201cThis is his opportunity to really promote himself and his philosophy and make himself out to be a bit of a martyr.\u201d Trump did talk about sending in U.S. troops to American cities in summer 2020 as protesters filled the streets in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death at the hands of a police officer, an action that would have come under the Insurrection Act. He never did. Los Angeles-based defense lawyer Nina Marino said the Insurrection Act defense could work. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great defense from the 1800s resurrected into 2022,\u201d she said. But she added: \u201cIf there\u2019s evidence that they would have done it anyway, then I think that really, really damages the defense.\u201d Prosecutors have already pointed to a message from December 2020 that Rhodes wrote, saying Trump \u201cneeds to know that if he fails to act, then we will.\u201d Days before the riot, Rhodes warned that the \u201cfinal nail\u201d would be put in the \u201ccoffin of this Republic,\u201d unless they fought their way out. \u201cWith Trump (preferably) or without him, we have no choice,\u201d Rhodes wrote in a chat, according to court papers. He added: \u201cBe prepared for a major let down on the 6-8th. And get ready to do it OURSELVES.\u201d ___ This story has been corrected to show the Insurrection Act is shorthand for a series of statutes that Congress passed between 1792 and 1871, not 1872. ____ Richer reported from Boston.

    "Shying from Trump, ex-Maine Gov. Paul LePage seeks job back": [
        "By DAVID SHARPOctober 1, 2022 GMT",
        " YARMOUTH, Maine (AP) \u2014 Whenthen-Maine Gov. Paul LePageendorsed Donald Trump in 2016, he credited himself as a prototype for the insurgent presidential candidate. \u201cI was Donald Trump before Donald Trump became popular, so I think I should support him since we are one of the same cloth,\u201d said LePage, whose two terms in office were punctuated by brash behavior and frequently offensive comments. Now, asLePage is running for a third termafter a brief retirement to Florida, he rarely talks about Trump in public, and his advisers say LePage\u2019s hiatus from politics changed him. He\u2019s eager to show he\u2019s smoothed over some of his own rough edges, though flashes of his fiery personality broke through recently at an event at a riverfront boatyard in Yarmouth, where he pledged to take on Democratic \u201celitists.\u201d \u201cI came from the streets. I was a fighter all my life,\u201d LePage told workers. \u201cI had to scrimp and save to eat and survive. I am a fighter.\u201d As LePage seeks to unseatDemocratic Gov. Janet Millsand become the longest-serving governor in Maine history, he is banking on an approach familiar to other Republican candidates in liberal- and moderate-leaning states who are trying not to alienate swing voters they would need to win a general election. LePage\u2019s efforts at putting distancing from Trump are particularly notable given LePage once invited comparisons to Trump \u2014 and made them himself. Democrats aren\u2019t going to let voters forget LePage\u2019stumultuous time in office, when he occasionally acted and sounded a lot like Trump. LePage attracted national headlines when he told the Portland chapter of the NAACP to \u201ckiss my butt,\u201d made racist remarks about drug dealers who impregnate \u201cwhite\u201d girls and accused a lawmaker of screwing over state taxpayers \u201cwithout providing Vaseline.\u201d His critics point to a recent campaign event in which LePage threatened to \u201cdeck\u201d a Democratic staffer who got too close to him \u2014 an incident, they say, that illustrates LePage hasn\u2019t changed at all. The race is shaping up to be among a dozen or so competitive contests for governor this election year. The way in which the campaign plays out with voters weary of political ugliness may be a harbinger for Trump\u2019s White House aspirations in 2024. LePage and Mills\u2019 adversarial relationship goes back years. Mills, a 74-year-old moderate and the first woman elected governor of Maine, is a former two-term attorney general whose stint as the state\u2019s top prosecutor coincided with LePage\u2019s time as governor. The two clashed publicly, with Mills declining to represent LePage\u2019s administration on some matters, forcing LePageto seek outside counsel to represent his interests in litigation. Her supporters portray her as a steady leader whose cautious COVID-19 policies helped guide the state through the worst pandemic in a century, with fewer coronavirus deaths per capita than most others. She expanded Medicaid \u2014 something LePage had blocked \u2014 and presided over the largest budget surplus in Maine history, which allowed the state tosend $850 relief checks to most residents. Raised in poverty and homeless for a time as a boy, LePage, 73, is an unabashed conservative whose past controversies often overshadowed his political achievements, such as lowering the tax burden, shrinking welfare rolls, overhauling the pension system and paying back millions of dollars of hospital debt. He attacked Mills\u2019 executive orders during the pandemic, including mandatory vaccines for health care workers, calling it a \u201creign of terror.\u201d He\u2019s called for a parental bill of rights in education, claimed Mill has allowed crime and drugs to proliferate and accused her of budgetary gimmicks that will cause problems in the future. He has promised to try again to eliminate the state\u2019s income tax. When LePage left office in 2019, prevented from seeking a third consecutive term by the Maine Constitution, he declared he was decamping for Florida, where the taxes were lower, and leaving politics behind. He didn\u2019t stay away long. Soon, he was headed back to Maine for what supporters described as \u201cLePage 2.0.\u201d LePage\u2019s senior adviser Brent Littlefield said LePage was astounded when Trump\u2019s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and that LePage fears the country is in danger of tearing itself apart. LePage issued a statement amid the violence supporting law enforcement and telling those involved in the riot \u201cto leave and go home.\u201d LePage served as Trump\u2019s honorary state chairman and once sought a job in his administration, but he now won\u2019t say whether he would vote for Trump for president if Trump runs again in 2024. Despite any private misgivings, however, LePage hasn\u2019t condemned Trump. He declined an Associated Press interview request. The former governor made no reference to Trump while touring Yankee Marina & Boatyard, even though Trump remains popular in rural Maine, where he twice won an electoral vote while losing the statewide vote. Boatyard president Deborah Delp said LePage is needed at a time when her workers are suffering from high inflation and worried about the future. She said she can \u201chandle some rough language\u201d from LePage if he puts the economy on track. \u201cPoliticians are politicians. And he\u2019s not a politician. He\u2019s a businessman. He says what he thinks,\u201d Delp said. Maria Testa, a Democrat from Portland, disagrees. \u201cHe\u2019s bombastic and has a cruel temper. He\u2019s such a big no for me,\u201d Testa said. While campaigning, LePage largely tries to steer clear of Trump\u2019s lies of a rigged 2020 election. LePage acknowledges that Biden is president but declines to address whether he thinks the election was legitimate. LePage also avoids the issue of abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion. Mills has pledged to fight to ensure women continue to have a right to a legal abortion in Maine. A third candidate for governor, independent Sam Hunkler, isn\u2019t expected to play much of a role in the race, unlike deep-pocketed independent Eliot Cutler, who did in 2010 and 2014, when LePage won each election without a majority. Maine\u2019s ranked-choice votingsystem won\u2019t be a factor. It is used in federal congressional races but not in the governor\u2019s contest because it runs afoul of the Maine Constitution. Betsy Martin, a retired health care administrator from Biddeford, said residents are feeling drained by the corrosive partisanship in a rural state with a tradition of moderate politics and independent voters. Some are tuning out altogether, she said. \u201cThey\u2019re exhausted. They\u2019re extremely fatigued. We\u2019re worn out,\u201d she said. ___ Follow David Sharp on Twitter @David_Sharp_AP ___ Follow AP for full coverage of the midterms at https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections and on Twitter, https://twitter.com/ap_politics",
